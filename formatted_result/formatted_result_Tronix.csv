As a proud holder of $EGO, I am excited to share some significant developments that promise to elevate our community and the token's value. This Thursday, during the Weekly EGO Show, we will witness the launch of the highly anticipated $EGO bridge to the Tron network. This expansion is a major milestone for $EGO, marking its presence across multiple blockchain platforms. With substantial traction already achieved on Solana and Base, integrating with Tron further solidifies $EGO’s position in the competitive crypto space.

Why is This Integration Significant?

Tron is swiftly becoming a prominent hub for memecoins, and this is big news for us $EGO holders. The Tron network offers low transaction fees, high liquidity, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem that rivals established networks like Solana and Ethereum. Under Justin Sun’s leadership, Tron has been actively promoting memecoins such as Sundog, which have already made significant waves in the market. By bridging $EGO to Tron, we are strategically positioning ourselves to tap into this vibrant and growing market, thereby enhancing our visibility and adoption among memecoin enthusiasts.

Benefits of the $EGO-Tron Bridge:

1. Increased Exposure: Expanding to Tron allows $EGO to reach a broader audience within the memecoin community. This increased visibility can attract more investors and users, potentially driving up the token’s value and utility.

2. Enhanced Transaction Efficiency: Tron's blockchain is renowned for its low-cost transactions and fast processing times. As a result, $EGO holders will benefit from quicker and more economical trades, making our trading experience smoother and more cost-effective.

3. Cross-Chain Utility: With integrations across Solana, Base, and now Tron, $EGO is establishing itself as a versatile token with robust cross-chain functionality. This multi-chain presence ensures that $EGO remains accessible and functional across various blockchain ecosystems, increasing its utility and appeal.

What This Means for the Future of $EGO:

The introduction of the Tron bridge is expected to act as a catalyst for $EGO's continued growth and adoption. Our strong and supportive community has already shown immense backing for $EGO, and this strategic move could propel the token to new heights. By expanding our reach and enhancing our functionality, $EGO is well-positioned to drive significant value and establish itself as a leading memecoin in the market.

Join Us for the Big Reveal:

As a dedicated holder, I encourage all community members to mark their calendars for this Thursday at 6 PM UTC / 2 PM EST. This launch is a pivotal moment for $EGO, and being part of this event will allow us to witness firsthand the expansion and promising future that lies ahead for our token. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to celebrate and support the growth of $EGO.

Get ready to take $EGO to the next level. Let’s move forward together and achieve new milestones in our crypto journey!

See you Thursday!

We’ve got some insights from CoinGate’s September data about Tron's role in payments:

* TRON is the most preferred blockchain for payments, accounting for 31.6% of all transactions on our platform.
* On the TRON network, USDT is the top choice, making up 74.97% of transactions, with TRX following at 25.01%.
* TRX is the fifth most popular payment method overall, representing 7.9% of all payments made with cryptos.

You can clearly see that TRON dominates as a payment method and that the community trusts efficient, cost-effective payment solutions. 💪

Have you used TRON for payments recently? Share your experience in the comments!

Comment 0: Gift cards, hosting, VPN, and gaming are popular payments in the TRON network through our payment gateway. What was your last purchase with TRON?
Comment 1: Funny.  So many other cryptos are claiming the same thing.  I wonder if this a marketing ploy this bull run.
Comment 2: I need some .. sucks crypto com don’t have it
Comment 3: No its not LOL.  No one uses TRX
Comment 4: Liquid restaking on Ethereum. Stake at https://efter.fi. Deploy into DeFi at https://efter.fi/connect/. Sign up for Cash at https://efter.fi. to claim your rewards

Comment 0: Tron was a split from Etherium. Sun wanted eth to do something that Vitalek didnt so Sun basically copied etherium and then made it do what he wanted instead.

That rubbed a lot of people in the community the wrong way so it's been the target of non-stop fud. 

While that has been going on, Tron has been quietly gaining adoption in third-world countries where they need access to money quickly but do not want to pay a lot of fees. Tron was perfect for these transactions and has a lot of daily volume.

I feel like that constant demand has sustained the support. My hope is the fud eventually goes away.
Comment 1: All I know is I'm glad I got in when I did. Not as early as some, but early enough. Hopefully the trend continues. I just keep holding, claiming rewards, reinvesting them, and earning more rewards.
Comment 2: Nearly every single person from early crypto has gone to prison except Justin Sun. In China no less. He doing something right, somehow.
Comment 3: Slow and steady wins the race.
Comment 4: Check daily transactions. Tron has more transactions than any other chain.

It's used in India and Africa to do daily transactions. Bitcoin is too expensive.
Comment 5: Trx pump because of deflation and high use. Supply reduce around 2% a year and usage grow. It's even better if you liquid stack with strx stacking at 10% a crypto with a 2% supply decrease! Trx can hit 1$ in the next 10y
Comment 6: Yeah I saw it too when it was 0.13 and I bought my first bag thinking it was going to explode. Then we went back to 0.11 and then finally it exploded. Now aiming at 0.35, 0.75 and 1.5$ PT. It's the only altcoin killing it. The reason I believe is that people use a lot of USDT from TRC20 because of cheaper fees. Beware that revenue seems to be going up but slooooowly. Don't believe the short-lived hype of the JustinPump memepage, that lasted just 2 weeks of revenue
Comment 7: It is a deflationary asset where fees are returned to holders that stake. [https://tronscan.org/#/data/charts/trx/supply](https://tronscan.org/#/data/charts/trx/supply)

It hosts the majority of the most successful RWA project today, stablecoin USDT.

The world is a big place and I expect the value of TRX to increase over time.
Comment 8: Trx is a safe haven coin. When there is a crypto selloff, TRX outperforms. Look at the last few days with btc rallying, TRX underperformed.
Comment 9: All I know is I'm glad I got in when I did. Not as early as some, but early enough. Hopefully the trend continues. I just keep holding, claiming rewards, reinvesting them, and earning more rewards.
Comment 10: what's great about tron is not dapp  or their use cases but money laundering , black money  in usdt.  if you go casino online , forex broker and similar platforms. they offer transfer in and out with usdt, so ppl can deposit and withdraw easily , avoid tax and direct trnsfer from the bank accounts.

and ppl freeze $trx for free transfer with a bit of free $trx.  you won't see those sites offer usdt from other blockchains. additionally, some platform create their own token in Tron blockchain to use in their platforms as well.

  
in conclusion, black and grey money are thee facts that keep tron growing even justin sun doing the good or bad commercial but he's doing something out of the box

Comment 0: Buy from central exchanges. Whole list of them on coinmarketcap.
Comment 1: Trade for anything on fixedfloat(.com) :-)
Comment 2: If you use btc ATMs and centralized exchanges you get tron within about 45 mins, problem is that the fees for ATMs are usually 20% and centralized exchanges have withdrawals on top of that. You could deal with centralized exchanges directly and save a lot on fees but it will take 2-3 business day on average for your account to be credited. If you use OTC desks it will be same day but with higher fees then centralized exchanges but smaller then btc ATMs.

I have tried to look at the market, and for me it seems to be as each time BTC rises, TRX goes down. Is that correct for anyone more technically than me. 

And if yes, do you know the reason :)

Comment 0: I think Justin Sun sells some and could go short to save profits, and buy $BTC and long it as well.

Or just instiutions doing it as well, cause I doubt he is single handedly able to do such a thing.
Comment 1: Historically when bitcoin runs money moves into it and out of alts. In bull markets Bitcoin will have a leg up then alts will generally follow.
Comment 2: I don't necessary think tron should increase in price.  It is the engine behind USDT and many other stable coins. If it increases in price too much it'll become too expensive to do usdt transactions. Then there would be a migration to another chain that will have cheaper network fees. Tron has a huge role in the cryptocurrency industry and its price behaving like bitcoin wouldn't increase adoption of the network.
Comment 3: Trx has been a safe haven the past year.

I have a USDT TRC20 wallet i want to send money to. What would be a process to do that? I haven’t use use crypto much, used coinbase occasionally. From what I understood the process is:
1) Use Coinbase to buy TRX
2) Receive the TRX into TronLink wallet
3) Exchange TRX to USDT TRC20
4) Send USDT TRC20 to the receiver

Did I understand correctly? I checked Kraken as well since they claim to support trc20, but cant figure out how. 
Cheaper is better since plan to transfer regularly. Thanks!

Comment 0: Coinbase doesn't support trx so that won't work. If your end goal is to give someone stable coin just pick a different one that's more user friendly or you'll just be back here asking about energy and band with. Just pick something you can send straight from coinbase or w/e cex no need for additional fees

Can't really figure out how to rent trx and from where (most of the info is about lending out energy). Do I need to give these services like tronnrg, tronsave etc. unfettered access to my wallet? Do I pay them in USDT or TRX?

Comment 0: I use justlend in tronlink. Need 100 trx but you only end up spending like 3. Just make sure to go back and end the loan and get your trx back
Comment 1: For you I can recommend 2 solutions:

1. You can use our mobile dApp and make the transfer from our mobile dApp and you will have rent directly from multiple providers offering you an Energy estimation and renting price and you will need to sign a Trx transfer and energy will be in your wallet automatically and after that you can sign the transfer. Search OnChain Vision on play store
Telegram Community @OnChainVisionCommunity
I recommend this if you do transfer occasionally and for any token on tron including reduced swaps.

2. You could use cirotrx.com they use a 0.1 USD(at the moment) per transfer but you will first need first to approve the contract so will need to pay 2 Trx once the first time. I recommend this if you want to do frequent USDT transfer (they have a limited list of TRC20 tokens)
Comment 2: No don’t do that 
Just get faucet tron or find someone to send you down for gas fees

It and USDT are bed buddies...

You seem to have some cons already pre-established in your mind, so I won't delve there.

As far as ""dinosaur"" goes, you're right.... considering that buzzwords are a go-to this cycle, we've moved beyond the Bitcoin/Shitcoin attestation into a Bitcoin/Shitcoin by rank &amp; reputation environment.

Comment 0: As far as I know almost all stable coins have a blacklist function. This is on every chain not only on Tron. Stable coins issuers such as tether can blacklist your wallet address if they think it is missused for scamming or money laundring.
If that happens you would need to contact tether and do KYC with proof of funds origin in order to unblock your address for sending.
Comment 1: There are no risks in using stable coins on tron unless you are blatantly scamming people 

There is a reason Tron leads in stable coin transfers, everything is healthy.

At that point you could, in theory put those USDT to work on a lending platform or stake as liquid USDT for a year and make some free peanuts while you wait for your 18th.

If you're living in the western hemisphere, or @ least the northwestern, off-ramping without KYC is pretty much limited to P2P transfer and those can be potentially dangerous if involving strangers.

I tried gas station on safepal and it says ""You should have at least 15 TRX as network fee to create this swap order."" which sounds stupid to me because it said there wouldnt be any fees. any way to get 10 trx for gas fees without spending more money?

i just need some way i can pay in usdt without being scammed.

Comment 0: you probably found a post where someone listed their 12 word passphrase, there's no way of getting the usdt. They just steal the trx that you deposit
Comment 1: Check out [emailusd.net](http://emailusd.net) it lets you transact entirely in USDT including paying fees
Comment 2: If it's a large amount of USDT then why are you so concerned about buying TRX? Is it stolen USDT and you don't want it linked to your identity? Doesn't really make sense otherwise.
Comment 3: 10trx is like, what $1.60.  ??? These posts are unreal.
Comment 4: Smolrefuel is a cross platform site for paying gas fees from other networks (not sure if TRX is present)... 

Token pocket wallet (never used, cannot verify) offers a ""pay gas on USDT transfer with USDT).
Comment 5: 10 trx? I use 100 trx daily when I run out of energy
Comment 6: Also remember, Tron has been a deflationary coin for over a year and a half. Not many large chains can claim that title, not even ETH.
Comment 7: Kraken has TRX
Comment 8: I need like $4 worth of trx to withdraw my USDT on okx wallet to another wallet, think someone could send me some please? sorry for begging, are there threads where I could get some?

I just checked tronpluse, we're I delegate my energy, and I have still habe spare energy in my account (usually its all gone) is the energy demand gone down? 

Also how do I get the left over energy rented out? 


Comment 0: how much energy is it? renting sites require a minimum to submit the rent-transaction
Comment 1: Many usdt transactions now require 64k energy, up from 32k. If you don't have at least 64 you may see longer waits before it gets rented out.
Comment 2: I have 500k of energy, not been used. Last time I checked, I believe I have over 1 million of energy altogether.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/1fuds3k/scamming_scammers/|Scamming scammers|"Post: Hi everyone,

I've found a few OKX tron accounts on facebook groups, which have 200-5k dollars on them. The poster says that they need help transferring funds from their OKX account to a Binance account or some other bs. The poster also says their 12 word mnemonic phrase. The accounts do have funds on them, but only in USDT. The scam entails that you have to deposit TRX (like 10-20$ worth) to pay the fees to transfer the funds. The scammer probably has a feature turned on from their end that doesent allow you to successfully transfer, and they steal the TRX deposited money.  Is there any way to successfully ""steal"" this money from the scammer?

Edit: If anyone finds a working solution, I'll send them 200$ worth of USDT

Thanks!

Comment 0: No because they have multi-signature enabled which means you need access to another wallet. 

If they don't have this enabled then you could stake energy for them and use energy to transfer the account balance instead of having to deposit TRX.
Comment 1: No. Move on with your life, you will never be able to transfer out the usdt.

Been wondering which one is the easiest/cheapest.

I just store. Delegate. Occasionally send some trx. And occasionally claim.

Which wallet/app would you advice for a desktop/pc user? And please state why.

Thnxc in advance.

Comment 0: Best is to use tronlink mobile with a ledger X.
It's much much more user friendly and everything is handled over tronlink which is the native wallet.
On Desktop there is a tronlink web extension, however most of the times it just leads you to tronscan to do those things, therefore mobile is the way to go imo.
Comment 1: For what you're using it for, you're right where you need to be. 

Tronscan and ledger work great IMO, a bit limited in terms of Dapps compared to Tronlink but with a rock-solid track record and a built in blockscanner. 

Tronscan is the superior wallet for ledger users who keep it simple on the Tron chain IMO.

Comment 0: Kraken Exchange, otherwise coingecko search TRX by ""markets"" and see the exchanges that deal with TRX listed by TVL.

Comment 0: most pain and suffering are self brought our dear brother, gonna need to explain more if you want help
Comment 1: have you approved any nft or other scam tokens before. or approve cobtract from suspicios sites?
Comment 2: Usually the hacker once they got your private key or mnemonic they change tge account permissions on tron in multi sign so that the owner loooses entire access to wallet and that the hacker can unstake which will take 14 days and you will catch if they submitted a transaction in your name.

Unfortunately your account is lost for ever. You MUST ensure your other accounts and accept the lost..

Comment 0: It doesn't work because sunswap is on tron blockchain only.
Logically you can not swap on the tron blockchain and send eth to an ethereum chain address.
You could try with a bridge, for example symbiosis.finance that should work.
Make sure to use right networks Tron for TRX and Ethereum for ETH in your case and make sure to have around 500k energy since the bridge is quite expensive.

Also check price impact as well on sunswap, you would lose hard on this trade.
Comment 1: You are entering an Ethereum wallet when you need to enter a Tron Blockchain wallet. 

Sunswap is not a bridge. 

Use allbridge or symbiosis or router nitro to bridge from TRON to other blockchains.

I log in once month to claim rewards. Today, I tried connecting like I normally would and it is not asking me to confirm the address. The result is that I do not end up connected and cannot go into the asset management screen to claim rewards. Or, do anything else. It just shows me the balance in the account.

Has anyone else had this problem and what is a solution?

Thank you

Comment 0: Use it in combination with tronlink.org wallet

Best on mobile.

Is there a time reset waiting period so i can try all my possible passwords according to my memory?



Comment 0: I think you will able to try again after certain time.
But since you did write down the words in the beginning which is the most important thing in crypto you can just delet the app and import the wallet freshly with those words and just setup a new password that you can remember.
The seed words are the real access, the password is just a lock on the tronlink app itself.
Comment 1: Did you write down your seedphrase ?

Comment 0: No, crypto addresses are public knowledge and searchable by anyone.

Pseudonymous Not Anonymous
Comment 1: No, you can't, you will be breaking crypto's concepts. Why would you want to do that anyway? By knowing your address they can only transfer on it, not from it, so you are in a good position.
Comment 2: As mention by other you cannot hide an address from blockchain but you can at any time generate an address that others do not know and use that (so no correlation from you and that address is known). If you are talking about tha address that you get from binance to make a deposit is best to talk with their customer service and try and talk with them to generate a new address (I know sometimes binance changes their deposit addresses)
