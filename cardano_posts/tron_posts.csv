Content: Looks like his ID disc isn’t a disc. Some sort of triangle design - can’t wait to see it with the blade turned on.

Content: Ok boys Hear me out: his color is Red. He's made by a Dillinger. He's probably a bad guy. He's going to the real world meet humans for the first time. Smth goes really wrong. Ares goes ""C.L.U mode"" and decides to invade our world. Sam, Quorra and Tron needs to find a way to stop him.

Content: Let's all focus on all the positive aspects of the movie revealed so far: Positive points on the production of ""TRON: ARES"" :* Joachim Ronning: Director of ""Young Woman and The Sea"" which has received many positive movie reviews by both Film Critics and Audiences. Showing he's evolved and learned to be a very well versed and skilled director overall.* Cinematography in the movie is by Jeff Cronenweth whom did the cinematography on ""Fight Club"", ""The Social Network"", and ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" which all had great cinematography.* Stars many talented actors such as Cameron Monaghan, Evan Peters, Greta Lee, Gillian Anderson, and the venerable Jeff Bridges.* Continues to use a blend of practical sets, physical props, and physical VFX technology combined with digital VFX, and specialized lighting effects evolving the VFX techniques used in ""TRON LEGACY""* The score is being composed by the highly talented and experienced Trent Reznor and Atticus (Nine Inch Nails) focusing on their own flavor of intense electronica-synth music.* Script and Screenplay is by a collaboration between multiple BAFTA winning, multi-nominated Jack Thorne with Jess Wigutau.* Steve Lisberger is one of the Executive Producers on the movie to offer his knowledge and input of the entire ""Tron"" universe into the movie during production.

Comment 9
Content: Man, this movie has 0% chance to be good. Open Wikipedia, take a look at producers, cast and so on. All of them make extremely bad movies. When bunch of people who make bad movies group up, they can’t magically pop out a good movie. Tron will be a box office flop with low audience score. I bet Jared Leto and other producers are just stealing money, or who else would be so dumb enough to finance this movie…


Comment 10
Content: I’m cautiously optimistic. They’re in a tough spot. Legacy was 30-something years after the original, so they couldn’t do a direct sequel. So they made a huge time jump, built out the between-lore, and rebooted it and left the door open for a real sequel to Legacy. Unfortunately with the timing of the Star Wars acquisition and Tomorrowland flop, the grounds weren’t as ripe as they planned on, so they canned it.Now 10 years later, it’s once again been too long for a real direct sequel. Sam and Quorras actors are noticeably older, bridges is MUCH older looking, lore has been expanded upon in other media, Boxleitner seeks disconnected, so they've again got no option but to soft reboot again with a story thats plausibly in the same universe, but disconnected enough thay they caj do new things without un-canonizing the other media they've made.I'm not the biggest Leto fan, and losing Daft Punk sucks, but i do know that Leto is a huge fan and this is something of a passion project for him, so I dont think he will let it tarnish TRON. Plus, there's a lot of good people also working on this, it's not all lost just cause of one guy. Legacy was a totally new story with a mostly new cast and new grid and we all love it. I think there's enough potential to he optimistic here as well.

Comment 1
Content: There was a critic on a defunct website (one of the old sci-fi, monster movie magazines turned website) that had a critic named ""Rob"".We had extremely different views on what made a movie great, so I would always check out his reviews.If he thought it was a ""C"" movie, I knew it would be awesome.If he gave it an ""A"", I knew I would hate it.A ""B"" was a complete tossup.I remember he didn't like Legacy, so I knew I would love it, especially as a fan of the OG Tron (saw it in theaters when I was just a wee binary bit).Can attest this is 100% accurate meme.


Comment 2
Content: Legacy was ahead of it's time...my only true complaint will probably be the story, for me it's personally the easiest part to forget, but I mean... considering daft punk, the characters, and the timeless visual effects that still hold on to this day ..yeah the story was probably the last thing needed really


Comment 3
Content: I love the graphics, sound design, music, sets, costumes and the action. The writing can use work, but I still love it. I'm not going to say ""nOt LoOkIng FoR aN oScAr WInNer"" to battle anything.It's a great summer flick with flaws. If Transformers, Fast & Furious, every Dwayne Johnson jungle movie can make millions and a long-running franchises, we can have Legacy.Really enjoyed the video game that tied with it: Tron Evolution.


Comment 4
Content: It's just a movie about being inside a computer and programs fighting with glow up frisbees.Just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride. It never deserved to get the hate it received when it came out.


Comment 5
Content: Legacy my beloved


Comment 6
Content: ‘It’s just a long daft punk video’ yeah, king genius, film is a visual medium. If you want good dialogue go watch a Preston Stergis movie. Me and the homies are watching TRON and getting pussy, nerd.


Comment 7
Content: Fuck I love everything about this movie. Story could be better, but for Hollywood, it's top notch.


Comment 8
Content: Legacy is freaking amazing! First off the entire concept of the Tron IP is so damn good. Secondly, IMO the production design in Legacy might be my favorite in any movie ever. The way The Grid and Tron City look, the design of the suits, the Lightjets…so visually spectacular!!! As for the storyline it’s so simply great. I don’t need some intricate twisting and turning plot in a movie like this.


Comment 9
Content: I remember seeing Tron Legacy before seeing the original Tron and I still thought it was a phenomenal movie. I don’t think any movie will ever top a legacy sequel like Tron Legacy.


Comment 10
Content: I remember distinctly when it came out Garrett Hedlund was panned for being wooden, which I thought was too bad as I thought he did a good job. And it's hard to overcome if critics think your main character's actor isn't dynamic enough to carry the movie.For myself I wished it had tackled some of the harder sci-fi questions presented head-on. Instead they were either left on the cutting room floor or not scripted. But probably would have been hard to integrate.I think as a society we're trying to navigate a world where so many people have such strong negative emotions about so much media, especially when change is involved. I don't mind that Tron: Legacy has taken on a sort of cult classic vibe, so many great movies wear that mantle.And yes, I am looking forward to Ares.

Comment 7
Content: Disney sabotaging the Tron franchise so they can say hey we tried and bury it for good because they don’t believe in their own IP. /s


Comment 8
Content: I'm gonna be honest there, I feel like their story is concluded and I'm pretty satisfied with their ""end."" No way to go about making a story involving them but re-imagining the entire world, which sounds cool but not very TRON.No, I feel like the sequel should involve The Grid, or, if we're wanting to return to our roots, the workings of a different computer/network. I always thought the implication was ""this is what happens inside the virtual environment of the digital world"" and less centered around a specific Grid (as much as my heart absolutely *lives* on the Game Grid).


Comment 9
Content: Jared Leto is not an ideal choice at all imo. He always does better as a side character rather than a main character (see “Dallas Buyers Club” and “Blade Runner 2049”). He just doesn’t have the personality to carry a film and be charismatic enough to be likable.Garrett carried on the Stoner-Esq laid back vibe of Jeff Bridges without a hitch. He made for a likable guy with a understandable story, and that was only enchanted tenfold by Olivia Wilde’s character being the exact opposite of him. Where he was bored with the real world and wanted something exciting she was bored with the game world and fascinated by the mundane.Of course, I was a far bigger fan of Joseph Kosinski as the director seeing as he has went on to make some amazing films rather than Joachim Rønning who has made two of Disney’s worst films. I don’t have high hopes for the new film, but in reality I think any sequel is better than no sequel at this point.

Comment 1
Content: He didn’t define perfect, so Clu did it as he saw it.


Comment 2
Content: The best part, for me, is that Clu straight up gave Flynn a confirmation dialogue before proceeding:*""Am I still to create the perfect system?""*`Continue? (Y/N) >`And Flynn's like, ""Yeaaah?""It's a subtle thing, but such a *program* thing to do.


Comment 3
Content: It's part of the tragedy. Clu is not exactly a villain, he's an entity with a set objective, a program uncapable of changing unless someone else changes him.He retains the concept of perfection that Kevin had when he created Clu. While Kevin changed, Clu remained the same.And people dare tell me that this movie does not have profound concepts.


Comment 4
Content: CLU inferred perfection required elimination of imperfect humans (Flynn) and ISOs.

Comment 1
Content: Hi r/tron! Like a lot of people, I was super keen to experience the world of Tron Legacy first hand in some way, but obviously had no way to do so. So I spent the last year and a half building this game for VR (although it is also playable flatscreen). It features an arena level, a reimagined “Outlands”, and a safe house. I didn’t want to copy things exactly, but I think it remains faithful to the movie.So would you play it? Do you have any particular criticisms of what I have shown in this trailer? Or have you actually already played it? All feedback is welcome.The game is called HYPERCYCLE ARENA and can be played on PS4, PS5 and PSVR. It is free to play here on the PS4 Dreams platform (PS4 Dreams must be purchased first): [https://indreams.me/dream/mxAVpvjZxMZ](https://indreams.me/dream/mxAVpvjZxMZ)A full quality 4K version of the trailer can be seen here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVWB4MoqyS0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVWB4MoqyS0)**UPDATE: Thanks for all your kind feedback! Here are some answers to common questions:****1: Disney vs fan-made content**Disney could ask Media Molecule (the makers of Dreams) to remove my creation at any time, which would mean it becomes private (so at least I still get to play it 😀). However I think this is unlikely because:* I am not profiting from my creation* I am not using Disney trademarks* I am not competing with a Disney product* I am not causing Disney any financial loss or damage to their brand**2: PC and other platforms**Unfortunately there is no way to convert a Dreams creation to another platform. So currently that would mean starting from scratch with a new game engine. And without the support of Disney, this would be a risky project to invest another year or two into.**3: Multiplayer**Currently Dreams does not support online multiplayer, so all my enemy bikes and teammates are AI. However it does look like Dreams will eventually support multiplayer, so I will be keen to add a multiplayer mode when this happens.

Comment 1
Content: Flynn was unironically far more like an older Luke Skywalker than Disney’s official Luke.- He had an actually reasonable explanation for his absence, something out of his control.- He did everything to fight back until isolation was the last resort, as opposed to just giving up immediately and whining while his friends and loved ones die.- His efforts to build a ~~Jedi Order~~ digital utopia were thwarted when the person he taught betrayed him, an act he blamed partly on his own perceived faults as a teacher, not the result of him acting like a literal psychopath out of nowhere. - He clearly possessed a wisdom and inner peace befitting his years and experiences, yet also managed to retain his down-to-earth personality.- His ideology evolved, from seeking perfection to recognizing the true value of imperfection, instead of devolving into schlock utterly detached from his prior characterization.- He ultimately reconciled with his greatest mistake and, in doing so, saved both the entire world (literally) and *his* entire world (his son); instead of dying for basically nothing after *taunting the student he failed*.


Comment 2
Content: The original Star Wars trilogy (mostly the first) and Tron 1982 both pushed sci fi concepts as well as visual effects to a new level upon release. While the story and aesthetic are pretty different, they’ve actually got a lot in common! Tron is def my fav tho


Comment 3
Content: At least Tron will only be (most likely) soiled by one bad movie instead of many.


Comment 4
Content: Tron is too stylistically and thematically restrictive to have pulled that off.Star Wars could have (if not for Disney milking it and [reification](https://youtu.be/gB4lULC87Oo)) hundreds of planets worth of content ready to be created, all stylistically and narratively different.If Tron *wasn’t* so stylistically focused, it wouldn’t be Tron! It would be any other science fiction movie.That’s not to mention the toys. Star Wars was **huge** for toys. Having the creative headroom for a wide variety of designs is really important in that way.


Comment 5

Comment 8
Content: I really like a lot of Star Wars stuff Disney's put out (Mando, High Republic), but I would trade it all for Uprising season 2 and so much more.


Comment 9
Content: Tron is a billion dollar franchise they’ve been sitting on. Been thinking this for years. We haven’t had many people take on Tron with the love and care of movies like Spider-verse or Cars. All we need is 1 fan to get in there and get this idea rolling. Just think of the profit of the toys and merch disney aren’t putting out.


Comment 10
Content: Konsinski needs to direct a Star Wars movie. Been saying it since Oblivion, and look how Maverick turned out.Legacy was made for a niche but as a film it excels in every category. The new ride and upcoming sequel tells us Disney knows this too.

Content: I'm in two minds on this idea...On the one hand, programs leaving the Grid and entering the real world seems like a pretty natural continuation of the franchise, but I'd rather see it through the eyes of someone we know like Quorra and not someone completely new; I worry it will just be a paint by numbers fish out of water story that way with a lot of dumb tired jokes

Content: If they’re anything like the legacy costumes, he’s in for a lot of long, sweaty hours. I helped build the electroluminescent fabrics, high intensity battery packs, and wifi controls built into the magnetic disk hub mounts. Expect another radically different look; that was over 14 years ago now.


Comment 5
Content: Arg Jared Leto—another person whose behavior as a professional doesn’t foster a safe and stable work environment for those around him. If you read about his time on Suicide Squad, especially, he made work awkward and even awful for everyone. He “gifted” a dead pig to Viola Davis and admitted to sending “anal beads and used condoms to his co-stars.” (per Wikipedia)He justified his behavior by saying, essentially that, this is what Joker would do. The Joker is fictional, and doing all this on his own undermines the actual director and the rights of his fellow actors to not find a god damn dead pig in their trailer.To folks who say that he’s a good actor so all his behavior is acceptable, I say, I don’t want to watch a good performance from one actor when everyone else in the movie were mentally harmed in the making of this movie. Also, I actually think he’a not a great actor because he is so method, so into his role, he seems like a cgi character in a movie made in 1995. He stands out so much from everyone else it’s distracting and instantly reminds me “Oh yeah, that Jared Leto.” Which takes me out of the scene or even the movie.

He is a good actor that has done some bad roles but he has played some great villains like in 2049. I personally would hate for him to be the main good guy so I’m hoping he’s the villain because that’s what Ares was always going to be. But even if he is Im not gonna say the movies shit up until I see it. I really hope we get Garret Hedlund and Olivia Wilde back for Sam and Quorra as the main characters

Jared Leto is the star of this third one, and I’m really anxious to work with him, and I’ve admired his work.”>“[I’m really excited] to see what the technology is going to be all about [this time],” Bridges added, a recurring theme throughout the interview.>Bridges appeared in “Tron: Legacy,” directed by Joseph Kosinski, and said while the technology was constantly changing, he didn’t know what to expect. He also noted that he didn’t love how his de-aging looked in that movie.>“When I did ‘Tron 2,’ ‘Tron Legacy,’ we had to put all these dots on our face and all these kinds of things,” Bridges explained of the motion capture technology used at the time. “And that’s [probably] all passé. I had to see myself as a young guy or as another character, but the same guy, but it was gonna be digitally created. I think it was [de-aging], but I didn’t like the way I looked in it; I felt like I looked more like Bill Maher than myself; it was kind of bizarre [laughs].”>While he hasn’t been apprised about the new tech, Bridges said “Tron: Ares” filmmaker Joachim Rønning (“Kon Tiki,” “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil”) would potentially use a lot less CGI and, instead, more practical sets.>“I’m anxious to see what the technology and what it will be. I hear there’s even less A.I. stuff in this. It’s going to be more a practical set, and they’re beautiful; there are beautiful sets that I’ve seen.”Edit:[Confirmed by Disney](https://twitter.com/DisneyStudios/status/1785006550941151338):>Jeff Bridges returns to the grid.

Content: I wasn’t aware that Monaghan was attached to this, but this bodes well for TRON fans; if you’re unfamiliar with his work beyond the mainstream screen, he’s actually carved himself a niche in the Star Wars gaming community portraying the lead in the *Jedi Fallen Order* and *Jedi: Survivor* series. I’m not invested in the larger gaming community, but I’ve explored both games’ additional material enough to glean his perspectives and he seems to *get it*. He recognizes his role as the *performer* and really hypes up the process around him, and his character Cal Kestis seems beloved by the gamers.

Presumably it wasn’t connected to Flynn’s private system, so it wouldn’t have experienced CLU’s takeover and would still be functioning just fine.

Content: Man I absolutely love the aesthetic of this grid. It is so very beautiful and the outdated graphics of the movie aged extremely well and still look stunning too this day. Combined with the ambient music of the original film, this version of the grid was always so mysterious yet beautiful, a unique combination that made me want to explore it all the more. Every location was unique and even when they used the same assets they made them stand out in every scene. I would love to see an open world game set in this version of the grid cause it’s abstract and fun nature would make for some of the most out of body fun one could have!


Comment 8
Content: I like both grids. They represent the technology of when their movies were releases. This older grid is perfect for a time of floppy discs and dos. Its desolate in a beautiful way.The city like grid of the sequel also makes sense. Internet, high speeds, better tech - makes sense things would be bigger and more evolved and slick.

Content: I miss programs as avatars of their creators.


Comment 10
Content: It's so weird... we are far enough away from Tron Legacy that I have nostalgia for both the 82' Tron and 2010 Tron Legacy. It also really helps that the sound of both movies is also as drastically different as the visuals. I kind of miss the quiet and old school video gamey sounds of the '82 Grid... I just automatically associate the Grid from Tron Legacy/Tron Uprising with the Daft Punk soundtrack now.

Jared Leto has acted in a BUNCH of really good movies (Blade Runner 2049, Fight Club, Dallas Buyers Club, etc), He's also acted in some real stinkers (Alexander, Morbius, The Outsider).He's good when he's good. He's bad when he's bad. . . Just like most actors. So I don't understand why his presence seems like an automatic deal breaker for so many people.

I located it, sanitized it the best I could with my own spit, placed it back in my eye. After the show he apologized and gave me an autograph of what looked like an alien had signed it.

Comment 1
Content: Maybe they don't need disc's? Some weird.sorta program-come-alive plot armor that let's them ""survive"" w/o a disc creating some sort of invulnerability to standard deprogramming tactics? Just an immediate thought, based on absolutely nothing


Comment 2
Content: You might think through it via two modes:* **Production Design Maturation**: *Tron* was very on the nose with the discs being controllable, throwable objects, by literally using Wham-O Frisbees as props. *Legacy* was able to divert further from this concept, maintaining the disc as a throwable weapon. Perhaps *Ares* simply continues this sophistication further, by reaching outward into the periphery of other known throwables—there are boomerangs, for example, that are triangular in shape. This can be a typical venture in all design fields: as users become more familiar with and immersed in an object/concept, then that item can ever-gradually evolve further and further, evolving the immersed users' comprehension of the object/concept along with it.* **Modern Technologies Beget Modern Concepts**: Back in *Tron*'s time, discs—the objects on which computer data was physically written—were often round objects that must be spun to be read by the disk head, like a record player. It could be thought of that, now in the 21st century, where the leading tech in data-storage/retention is solid-state (which no longer relies on being a perfectly round object that must be spun to be of use), that the conceptual analogs of these objects in the symbolic realm inside computers can also be free to deviate from their original real-world referent. Makes me think of how the archaic 3.5-floppy icon can often still represent the concept ""save"" in software today, when we now have about two generations of tech users who have been born after the floppy turned obsolete.


Comment 3
Content: Flynn and Clu are presumably dead ( i know Jeff Bridges is back but we don't know how back he is) that could have caused some unforseen changes.The world of TRON, when compared to other fictional universes, is relatively unexplored and underdeveloped. There's more than so much about the Grid and programs that we simply don't know.


Comment 4
Content: My theory is they're a different kind of program, maybe from a different grid. Since it says Dillinger on the disc, and we know Dillinger is playing a larger role in this movie, I reckon he made his own programs and the triangle discs are just a style change to show that. Idk how they're gonna work though.


Comment 5
Content: Calling it ""dumb"" without any context at all is a little strange, don't you think?


Comment 6
Content: Are we pretending a triangular Aerobie doesn’t exist?


Comment 7
Content: I believe the Discs are now upgraded to ""Guns"". If you played TRON 2.0 there are a lot of new weapons in the gam, and one of them is a Triangular Shaped Gun ""Like a Triangle Disc Gun"".I cut a YT video to show it: [Triangle Gun Tron](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx4StBuqpa_19JTSiw_umGM3mYYpzrGe0n?si=NuoFhhoi5qH6X2Si)

Comment 1
Content: To this day, I defend Tomorrowland should have been a limited series. Movie rushed everything including the ending.


Comment 2
Content: I'm sad to see Tomorrowland in this meme. I know Tomorrowland didn't perform well at the box office, but it's a lot better film than most of Disney's recent Marvel and Star Wars content. Plus, it's actually one of my favorite live-action Disney films of the modern era. In my opinion, it perfectly mirrors the arc that Kevin Flynn has in Tron: Legacy. As a kid, George Clooney's character exudes the same kind of passion, drive, excitement, and optimism that Kevin Flynn had at the start of Tron: Legacy. Then, George Clooney's character gets driven out of paradise, just like Kevin Flynn has to go into hiding on the Grid. Both the ISOS and the recruitment animatronics are destroyed, representing the loss of hope for the future under the new regime. In both films, our new, hopeful protagonist meets the disillusioned old man and serves as the impetus to reignite their hope. In the end, both Kevin Flynn and Frank (Clooney's character) make a series of selfless sacrifices to help stop the worst-case scenario from happening, and both films end on a positive and hopeful note. While Tron: Legacy is clearly the better of the two, Tomorrowland really is a rare gem in Disney's bloated and most uninspired modern live-action catalog.

https://i.redd.it/6aydyzod3jyd1.jpeg,Kids Tron Costumes,"We love Tron. My 6-year-old had a Tron themed birthday party a few months ago. So I made these Halloween costumes for my kids this year. I spent more hours and money than I had available, but seeing them have so much fun was worth it. We do a group theme every year, and I’ll be sad when they decide they don’t want to do that anymore. For now, I’m just going to enjoy it.For those who want details: I sewed the jumpsuits out of 2 different rayon/polyester/spandex blend fabrics, and applied Velcro loop tape where I wanted the lights. Then I sewed reflective mesh to the Velcro hook tape, making casings that I could slide EL tape/strips into. That way I can remove the EL tape and the kids can just wear these for dress up play. I put a pocket on the upper back where the battery packs are hidden, under where the discs would attach (but I ran out of time to finish the discs; I still want to get them done though). The glasses are just $10 Amazon finds. They’re LED and can change colors to match.Let me know if anyone wants to see more details pics. I’ll take some and add them if you do.

Comment 4
Content: So I have a problem with the whole reintegration thing. We don't really know what it is, or why it was necessary for it to be done to get rid of clu. Flynn explains at the beginning that he created this program. Not that he split himself up or anything. It was very rushed to come to the conclusion that this action needed to be performed. I hope they explain what it is in this film and explore it more.

Comment 2
Content: Since the synopsis implies that the majority will be a fish out of the water movie. We will probably see not much of the modern grid.This movie seems to be mostly to be low budget.
