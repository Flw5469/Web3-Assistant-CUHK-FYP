      "*   The value of the CERRA utility token is no longer subject to mere speculation or perception. Its worth is now intrinsically linked to the performance of the platform itself. As platform usage grows, more profits are generated, resulting in each CERRA token yielding greater passive income. It follows naturally that an asset generating higher returns would be more valuable.\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   Given that CERRA utility token holders are actual owners of the platform, they are incentivized to actively utilize and advocate for the platform. This active engagement directly enhances the value of their tokens. Entities holding a substantial portion of the total token supply are motivated to invest in and enhance the platform, thereby increasing returns not only for themselves but also for the wider community.\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   The Cerra platform will encourage DeFi product usage through various means, including the farming of Lender/Borrower bond NFTs in P2P lending and farming of Spot swap LP tokens, both of which can be exchanged for CERRA tokens. This approach empowers platform users to become true platform owners simply by utilizing Cerra's products.\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   Since only staked (and locked) tokens generate passive income, a significant portion of the circulating token supply will be removed from the open market. This action, in turn, amplifies the demand for CERRA tokens. The intrinsic demand for CERRA utility tokens, coupled with the choice that token holders must make between using their tokens to generate yields or casting votes in DAO proposals, renders votes backed by tokens considerably more valuable and calculated.\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   This underlying economic structure empowers the Cerra team to be self-sustaining by retaining a portion of tokens and refraining from selling them in the open market, thus further restricting the token supply. From an end user's perspective, it is much more appealing to utilize products they own and reap a share of their profits, rather than funding someone else's endeavors.\n",

      "Upgradeable proxy pattern: trading-off smart contract immutability for security?Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like there's a consensus among blockchain security analysts about the need to use only [upgradeable proxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy) contracts for our dapps. The rationale is that bugs could be patched before someone finds out how to exploit them as security vulnerabilities.\n",

      "Fair enough. But one desirable feature of dapps is the immutability of the on-chain contract. The idea being that, as a user, you can read the code and then choose to interact with it, knowing that the conditions can't change. Wouldn't upgradeability hurt user's trust in the contract?\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine, for example, that someone releases an NFT collection of 1000 tokens, each mintable for 1 ETH. They set a 1% royalty for market transactions and they add a very strong guarantee: holders can, at any time, refund the token for 1 ETH. The smart contract is expected to hold the minting funds for possible refunds. The contract owner only profits from resales.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such a strong guarantee that the token value will never go below 1 ETH, it quickly sells out. But this is an upgradeable contract. What is stopping the contract owner from pushing an upgrade to drain the funds from the contract after it sells out?\n",

      "That's one of the discussions we've been having in the [Neulock Web3 Password Manager](https://neulock.app/) team.

      "We've decided to start with Ethereum and its largest L2s due to security considerations. But the user should be free to choose whatever blockchain they prefer, so we want to be present wherever the user wants us. Moreover, the only security risk of using a poor chain is to the availability: since Neulock syncs passwords without ever exporting any secrets (not even under encryption) and the frontend verifies all data, there's no risk to password confidentiality and integrity. So, while we're confident that passwords synced with Neulock will remain confidential in any chain, it's up to the user to evaluate their favorite chain's availability guarantees.\n",

      "Can Cardano Be Bigger Than Bitcoin? (article)Charles Hoskinson recently met with Argentina's President Javier Milei to explore how blockchain technology can transform global economic and political systems. During his speech at Tech Forum Argentina, Hoskinson discussed the future of blockchain and expressed his belief that Cardano has the potential to surpass both Ethereum and Bitcoin. He shared an ambitious vision that many Bitcoin enthusiasts dismiss, not realizing they share a common goal but approach it differently. Rather than debating whether Cardano will outgrow Bitcoin, it's more productive to embrace big ideas and remain open to all possibilities.\n",

      "I want to take a moment to rant about something that‚Äôs been on my mind, and I believe it‚Äôs relevant for anyone thinking about the future‚Äînot just in finance, but in technology and society as a whole. This isn‚Äôt financial advice; it's a PSA. Let‚Äôs break this down:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Model T of Crypto**\n",
      "\n",
      "I like to think of **Bitcoin** as the **Ford Model T** of the automotive industry. Back in the day, the Model T changed everything. It made cars accessible, put people on the road, and revolutionized transportation. But look where we are now‚Äînobody is buying a Model T today, because the **automotive industry** has evolved. Cars are safer, faster, more efficient, and packed with technology that no one could have imagined back in the early 1900s.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bitcoin is no different.** It laid the foundation for the crypto industry, and for that, we should be grateful. But just like no one would pour their entire life savings into a **Model T** today, it's important to question why we should treat Bitcoin as the only answer for the future. The world moves forward, and so does **technology**. (Easiest point to call out is that Bitcoin has failed as a means to purchase goods. It's a store of value. When nobody is selling because we are looking for the next leg up, miners will be pushed to stop running rigs and that alone could spell the death of BTC security.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Lag in Science and Legislation**\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that frustrates me is how **technology** evolves **faster** than the laws that govern it. **Cryptocurrency** has the potential to lift millions out of poverty, to offer financial freedom, and to create a system that‚Äôs decentralized and more fair. But look around‚Äî**big players** are manipulating the space. They‚Äôre trying to slow down the progress, because they don‚Äôt want to lose their control. **The SEC** even came up with the term \"**crypto asset security**\" as a way to **control** and **contain** what they don‚Äôt fully understand or can‚Äôt dominate.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a familiar story: when the old guard can‚Äôt beat the future, they **join it**‚Äîbut they do so in a way that suppresses the real innovations that could disrupt their power. Right now, they‚Äôre pushing **Bitcoin** because it‚Äôs \"proven.\" But ask yourself, are they pushing Bitcoin because it‚Äôs the best technology? Or because it‚Äôs the **easiest for them to control**?\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Old Guard Can‚Äôt Stop Us**\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôre at a point‚Äîlate **September 2024**‚Äîwhere it‚Äôs clear that the **old guard** has **lost**. They fought against this future for so long, and now that they can‚Äôt beat it, they‚Äôre trying to make it work for them. That‚Äôs why they want to suppress **altcoins** and keep the focus on Bitcoin. Now, I‚Äôm not saying all **altcoins** are better‚Äîmost of them honestly **suck**‚Äîbut here‚Äôs the problem: their suppression tactics are also **keeping people away from superior tech**, like **Cardano**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me explain why **Cardano** stands out. It‚Äôs **peer-reviewed**, **science-backed**, uses **eUTXO** (an **advancement** of Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO model), and like Bitcoin, it has a **limited supply**. But Cardano doesn‚Äôt stop there‚Äîit also has **DeFi**, **liquid staking**, **governance**, and many more features that are pushing the envelope of what‚Äôs possible. These advancements make it the **next evolution** in crypto, not just another altcoin trying to ride Bitcoin‚Äôs coattails.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The 20-Year Perspective**\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, if you‚Äôre 20 years old today, you‚Äôre not going to invest everything into a **Model T** and expect it to compete with the best cars a decade from now. Why would you do that in the **crypto market**?\n",
      "\n",
      "The old guard is banking on the fact that Bitcoin is \"proven,\" but **superior technologies** like **Cardano** are getting suppressed in the process. And if you‚Äôre holding for 10+ years, wouldn‚Äôt you rather be invested in something that represents the **future**, not the **past**?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why This Matters**\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm not telling you where to put your money‚Äîthat‚Äôs for you to decide. But I am telling you to **think critically**. Don‚Äôt buy into the hype of **Bitcoin** just because it was the first. Look at the **tech**. Look at what the future holds. There are better technologies out there, and just because the old guard doesn‚Äôt want you to see them doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt real. They are.\n",
      "\n",
      "This moment in time is for the **youth**, for the future builders of crypto. Let‚Äôs not be trapped by outdated technologies or manipulated narratives. Look at how **blockchain** and **crypto** can evolve beyond just being a store of value. There‚Äôs so much potential to create decentralized systems that help everyone, not just the big players.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Closing Thoughts**\n",
      "\n",
      "The future isn‚Äôt just about **proven tech**‚Äîit‚Äôs about **better tech**. So don‚Äôt just follow the path that‚Äôs been laid out for you. Think about where you want to be 10+ years from now, and whether what you‚Äôre investing in today has the potential to get you there.\n",

I've read through the answers which I am happy with, but know that l personally have no domain knowledge in law and the following answers aren't my own.\\n\\n\\n\\n&gt;**What is being done that‚Äôs relevant or different? Could I not sign a contract to pay in ADA before?**\\n\\nYes, you could always sign a contract to pay in ADA before this development. What is different here is the *legal enforceability* of the contract. Previously, even if you signed a contract using ADA or executed a smart contract, if a dispute arose, it might be difficult to get it enforced in court, particularly in jurisdictions that don‚Äôt recognise cryptocurrency transactions or smart contracts.\\n\\nIn this case, Argentina has legally recognised this specific smart contract transaction, integrating blockchain technology with traditional legal enforcement. This means if someone defaults, there is legal recourse beyond the code itself, and the contract is subject to Argentina's legal system. This could offer more security for people who aren‚Äôt fully comfortable relying on code alone.\\n\\n&gt;**Does IOG or CF not have contracts that are paid in ADA?**\\n\\nYes, it‚Äôs likely that Input Output Global (IOG) and the Cardano Foundation (CF) have contracts that are paid in ADA. However, those contracts are likely private agreements with specific legal stipulations based on the jurisdiction of the parties involved. The difference here is that this contract is one of the first known examples of a **legally enforceable** blockchain-based loan contract that‚Äôs tied to Cardano and recognised in the Argentine legal system. It showcases a step towards making crypto-based contracts a part of mainstream legal frameworks.\\n\\n&gt;**Isn‚Äôt the whole point of crypto to avoid these things (the legal system)?**\\n\\nThis touches on a central debate in the crypto space. Yes, one of the key aspects of decentralised finance (DeFi) is that smart contracts can self-execute without requiring intermediaries like banks or legal systems. In DeFi lending, for example, the parameters are transparent, collateral is locked, and code executes without human intervention.\\n\\nHowever, the point of this hybrid approach is to bring legal assurance to parties who might not be comfortable with code alone. Not everyone trusts that smart contracts can cover all eventualities or unforeseen issues. For example, smart contracts don‚Äôt handle edge cases well, like a party claiming they made an honest mistake or if there‚Äôs fraud that the code can‚Äôt detect. A legal framework offers an additional layer of security for those who value legal recourse.\\n\\n&gt;**How does taking someone to court make this better? Why not just use crypto‚Äôs lending apps?**\\n\\nCrypto‚Äôs lending apps work well within their scope, especially in DeFi ecosystems, where code enforces lending agreements automatically. However, those agreements typically require **over-collateralisation**, meaning the borrower has to lock in more assets than the loan is worth to cover potential defaults. This can limit access for people without sufficient collateral, like those from developing countries.\\n\\nThe legal approach being used here allows for **unsecured loans**, where trust between the parties is backed by legal enforceability rather than by over-collateralising assets. For instance, if someone doesn‚Äôt have enough collateral, they could still take a loan and be legally bound to repay it. Without a legal framework, the lender in a crypto lending app would simply lose their assets if the borrower defaults with no way to reclaim them in court. So, this model expands the use cases of lending beyond purely DeFi scenarios.\\n\\n&gt;**Why use crypto at all? Why not just sign a regular contract?**\\n\\nCrypto brings transparency, security, and immutability. Using ADA as the loan currency allows for cross-border, instantaneous, and trustless transactions that don‚Äôt require traditional banking intermediaries. Blockchain acts as a **public ledger** that verifies and records every transaction, offering transparency that regular contracts can‚Äôt achieve on their own.\\n\\nAdditionally, crypto can lower transaction costs and speed up payments, while traditional contracts tied to fiat currencies may suffer from slower processing times and higher fees, especially across borders.\\n\\n&gt;**Wouldn‚Äôt both people need to be in Argentina?**\\n\\nYes, legal enforceability in this case is limited to Argentina because the contract is recognised under Argentine law. If the borrower were in a different country, enforcing the contract would be difficult unless there is a bilateral legal agreement between the two countries. However, this demonstrates how individual countries can begin incorporating blockchain-based contracts into their legal frameworks.

Could I not sign a contract to pay in ADA before?**\\n\\nYes, you could always sign a contract to pay in ADA before this development. What is different here is the *legal enforceability* of the contract. Previously, even if you signed a contract using ADA or executed a smart contract, if a dispute arose, it might be difficult to get it enforced in court, particularly in jurisdictions that don‚Äôt recognise cryptocurrency transactions or smart contracts.\\n\\nIn this case, Argentina has legally recognised this specific smart contract transaction, integrating blockchain technology with traditional legal enforcement. This means if someone defaults, there is legal recourse beyond the code itself, and the contract is subject to Argentina's legal system. This could offer more security for people who aren‚Äôt fully comfortable relying on code alone.\\n\\n&gt;**Does IOG or CF not have contracts that are paid in ADA?**\\n\\nYes, it‚Äôs likely that Input Output Global (IOG) and the Cardano Foundation (CF) have contracts that are paid in ADA. However, those contracts are likely private agreements with specific legal stipulations based on the jurisdiction of the parties involved. The difference here is that this contract is one of the first known examples of a **legally enforceable** blockchain-based loan contract that‚Äôs tied to Cardano and recognised in the Argentine legal system. It showcases a step towards making crypto-based contracts a part of mainstream legal frameworks.\\n\\n&gt;**Isn‚Äôt the whole point of crypto to avoid these things (the legal system)?**\\n\\nThis touches on a central debate in the crypto space. Yes, one of the key aspects of decentralised finance (DeFi) is that smart contracts can self-execute without requiring intermediaries like banks or legal systems. In DeFi lending, for example, the parameters are transparent, collateral is locked, and code executes without human intervention.\\n\\nHowever, the point of this hybrid approach is to bring legal assurance to parties who might not be comfortable with code alone. Not everyone trusts that smart contracts can cover all eventualities or unforeseen issues. For example, smart contracts don‚Äôt handle edge cases well, like a party claiming they made an honest mistake or if there‚Äôs fraud that the code can‚Äôt detect. A legal framework offers an additional layer of security for those who value legal recourse.\\n\\n&gt;**How does taking someone to court make this better? Why not just use crypto‚Äôs lending apps?**\\n\\nCrypto‚Äôs lending apps work well within their scope, especially in DeFi ecosystems, where code enforces lending agreements automatically. However, those agreements typically require **over-collateralisation**, meaning the borrower has to lock in more assets than the loan is worth to cover potential defaults. This can limit access for people without sufficient collateral, like those from developing countries.\\n\\nThe legal approach being used here allows for **unsecured loans**, where trust between the parties is backed by legal enforceability rather than by over-collateralising assets. For instance, if someone doesn‚Äôt have enough collateral, they could still take a loan and be legally bound to repay it. Without a legal framework, the lender in a crypto lending app would simply lose their assets if the borrower defaults with no way to reclaim them in court. So, this model expands the use cases of lending beyond purely DeFi scenarios.\\n\\n&gt;**Why use crypto at all? Why not just sign a regular contract?**\\n\\nCrypto brings transparency, security, and immutability. Using ADA as the loan currency allows for cross-border, instantaneous, and trustless transactions that don‚Äôt require traditional banking intermediaries. Blockchain acts as a **public ledger** that verifies and records every transaction, offering transparency that regular contracts can‚Äôt achieve on their own.\\n\\nAdditionally, crypto can lower transaction costs and speed up payments, while traditional contracts tied to fiat currencies may suffer from slower processing times and higher fees, especially across borders.\\n\\n&gt;**Wouldn‚Äôt both people need to be in Argentina?**\\n\\nYes, legal enforceability in this case is limited to Argentina because the contract is recognised under Argentine law. If the borrower were in a different country, enforcing the contract would be difficult unless there is a bilateral legal agreement between the two countries. However, this demonstrates how individual countries can begin incorporating blockchain-based contracts into their legal frameworks. As more countries adopt similar measures, cross-border enforcement could become more feasible.\", 'edited': False, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'name': 't1_lr6htzm', 'is_submitter': False, 'downs': 0, 'author_flair_richtext': [{'a': ':CardanoAmbassador:', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/lu9l1j6o5f461_t5_3jns3/CardanoAmbassador', 'e': 'emoji'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Cardano Ambassador Moderator'}], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'body_html': '&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full transparency, I&amp;#39;ve shared the article for gpt to analyse and then I&amp;#39;ve shared your comment to have it answer your questions within the article&amp;#39;s context.

As the story goes, the wardrobe designer needed silly and distinctive footwear for the Brawndo-swilling denizens to wear during their appearances before the Extreme Court and selected these bulbous foam clogs from a Colorado-based startup.

In 2016, Google engineer Illia Polosukhin had lunch with a colleague, Jacob Uszkoreit. Polosukhin had been frustrated by a lack of progress in his project, using AI to provide useful answers to questions posed by users, and Uszkoreit suggested he try a technique he had been brainstorming that he called self-attention. Thus began an 8-person collaboration that ultimately resulted in a 2017 paper called ‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need,‚Äù whichintroduced the concept of transformersas a way to supercharge artificial intelligence. It changed the world. Eight years later, though, Polosukhin is not completely happy with the way things are shaking out. A big believer in open source, he‚Äôs concerned about the secretive nature of transformer-based large language models, even from companies founded on the basis of transparency. (Gee, who can that be?) We don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre trained on or what the weights are, and outsiders certainly can‚Äôt tinker with them. One giant tech company, Meta, does tout its systems as open source, but Polosukhin doesn‚Äôt consider Meta‚Äôs models as truly open: ‚ÄúThe parameters are open, but we don‚Äôt know what data went into the model, and data defines what bias might be there and what kinds of decisions are made,‚Äù he says. As LLM technology improves, he worries it will get more dangerous, and that the need for profit will shape its evolution. ‚ÄúCompanies say they need more money so they can train better models. Those models will actually be better at manipulating people, and you can tune them better for generating revenue,‚Äù he says. Polosukhin has zero confidence that regulation will help. For one thing, dictating limits on the models is so hard that the regulators will have to rely on the companies themselves to get the job done. ‚ÄúI don't think there's that many people who are able to effectively answer questions like, ‚ÄòHere's the model parameters, right? Is this a good margin of safety?‚Äô Even for an engineer, it's hard to answer questions about model parameters and what‚Äôs a good margin of safety,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure that nobody in Washington, DC, will be able to do it.‚Äù This makes the industry a prime candidate for regulatory capture. ‚ÄúBigger companies know how to play the game,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey'll put their own people on the committee to make sure the watchers are the watchees.‚Äù The alternative, argues Polosukhin, is an open source model where accountability is cooked into the technology itself. Even before the transformers paper was published in 2017, Polosukhin had left Google to start a blockchain/Web3 nonprofit called the Near Foundation. Now his company is semi-pivoting to apply some of those principles of openness and accountability to what he calls ‚Äúuser-owned AI.‚Äù Using blockchain-based crypto protocols as a model, this approach to AI would be a decentralized structure with a neutral platform. ‚ÄúEverybody would own the system,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAt some point you would say, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt have to grow anymore.‚Äô It‚Äôs like with bitcoin‚Äîthe price can go up or down, but there‚Äôs no one deciding, ‚ÄòHey, we need to post $2 billion more revenue this year.‚Äô You can use that mechanism to align incentives and build a neutral platform.‚Äù According to Polosukhin, developers are already using Near‚Äôs platform to develop applications that could work on this open source model. Near has established anincubation programto help startups in the effort. One promising application is a means to distribute micropayments to creators whose content is feeding AI models. I remark to Polosukhin that given its reputation, and Web3‚Äôs failure so far to take over the internet, crypto might not be the most reassuring analogy for a movement designed to rein in the most volatile technology of our era. ‚ÄúWe do need help with marketing,‚Äù he admits. One persistent argument against open source AI is that granting universal access to powerful models might empower bad actors to abuse AI for things like generating misinformation or creating new weapons. Polosukhin says that open systems aren‚Äôt really worse than what we have now. ‚ÄúSafety is just a masquerade that limits the functionality of these models,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAll of them are jail-breakable‚Äîit‚Äôs really not that hard.‚Äù Polosukhin has been proselytizing his idea, talking to scientists around the industry, including some of his ‚ÄúAttention‚Äù coauthors. Among the latter, he has found the most resonance from Uszkoreit, with whom he shared that fateful meal in 2016. Uszkoreit, whom I spoke with this week, agrees with much of Polosukhin‚Äôs argument, though he isn‚Äôt enamored of the moniker. Instead of ‚Äúuser-owned AI,‚Äù he‚Äôd prefer ‚Äúcommunity-owned AI.‚Äù He is particularly excited that an open source approach, perhaps with the micropayment system Polosukhin envisions, might provide a way to resolve the tough intellectual property crisis that AI has triggered. The giant companies are now engaged in an epic legal battle with creators whose work is at the heart of their AI models. Since those companies are relentlessly profit-driven, that conflict is built in, and even if they make efforts to compensate creators, those would inevitably be affected by their need to ultimately capture the most value for themselves. That would not be the case with a model built from scratch with the idea of recognizing and rewarding such contributions. ‚ÄúAll these questions about IP would go away if we had a way of actually recognizing the contributions of content creators,‚Äù says Uszkoreit. ‚ÄúFor the very first time in history, we have an opportunity to quantify what the value of a piece of information is, at least over longer periods of time, to humanity.‚Äù One question I have about the user-owned approach is where the money might come from to develop a sophisticated foundation model from scratch. Right now, Polosukhin‚Äôs platform makes use of a version of Meta‚Äôs Llama model, despite his reservations. Who would put up a billion bucks to create a totally open model? Maybe some government? A giant GoFundMe? Uszkoreit speculates maybe a tech company just below the top tier might go for it just to thwart the competition. It isn‚Äôt clear. But both Polosukhin and Uszkoreit are certain that if user-owned AI doesn‚Äôt appear before the world gets artificial general intelligence‚Äîthe point where superintelligent AI begins improving AI itself‚Äîa disaster will be upon us. If that happens, Uszkoreit says, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre screwed.‚Äù Both he and Polosukhin think it‚Äôs inevitable that AI scientists will create intelligence that is smart enough to improve itself. If the current situation persists, it will probably be a big tech company. ‚ÄúThen you get this runaway effect where suddenly a few corporations, or maybe the one that gets it first, ends up with a money-printing machine that ultimately creates a zero-sum game that sucks the air out of the economy, and that we can't let happen.‚Äù Does Polosukhin, when contemplating worst-case scenarios, ever have second thoughts on his role in leveling up AI? Not really. ‚ÄúWhichever breakthrough happened, would have happened with or without us, maybe at a different time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúFor us to continue evolving, we do need to have a different structure, and that's what I'm working on. If user-owned AI exists, it levels the playing field, and OpenAI and Google and the others are not able to become monopolists‚Äîthey would be playing the same game, on the same field. It evens out the risks and the opportunities.‚Äù You might even call it ‚Ä¶ transformative. Earlier this year, I wrote about how the authors of the ‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù paper invented transformers. The breakthrough helped ignite the generative AI movement. A deceptively random conversation between Polosukhin and Uszkoreit was a key moment in what became a historic achievement of thefateful eight Googlers‚Äîall of whom have now left the company. One day in 2016, Uszkoreit was having lunch in a Google caf√© with a scientist named Illia Polosukhin. Born in Ukraine, Polosukhin had been at Google for nearly three years. He was assigned to the team providing answers to direct questions posed in the search field. It wasn‚Äôt going all that well. ‚ÄúTo answer something on Google.com, you need something that‚Äôs very cheap and high-performing,‚Äù Polosukhin says. ‚ÄúBecause you have milliseconds‚Äù to respond. When Polosukhin aired his complaints, Uszkoreit had no problem coming up with a remedy. ‚ÄúHe suggested, why not use self-attention?‚Äù says Polosukhin. Polosukhin sometimes collaborated with a colleague named Ashish Vaswani. Born in India and raised mostly in the Middle East, he had gone to the University of Southern California to earn his doctorate in the school‚Äôs elite machine translation group. Afterward, he moved to Mountain View to join Google‚Äîspecifically a newish organization calledGoogle Brain. He describes Brain as ‚Äúa radical group‚Äù that believed ‚Äúneural networks were going to advance human understanding.‚Äù But he was still looking for a big project to work on. His team worked in Building 1965 next door to Polosukhin‚Äôs language team in 1945, and he heard about the self-attention idea. Could that be the project? He agreed to work on it. Together, the three researchers drew up a design document called ‚ÄúTransformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks.‚Äù They picked the name ‚Äútransformers‚Äù from ‚Äúday zero,‚Äù Uszkoreit says. The idea was that this mechanism would transform the information it took in, allowing the system to extract as much understanding as a human might‚Äîor at least give the illusion of that. Plus Uszkoreit had fond childhood memories of playing with the Hasbro action figures. ‚ÄúI had two little Transformer toys as a very young kid,‚Äù he says. The document ended with a cartoony image of six Transformers in mountainous terrain, zapping lasers at one another. There was also some swagger in the sentence that began the paper: ‚ÄúWe are awesome.‚Äù You can read thefull feature here. Dileep asks, ‚ÄúHow do you think students can best use the available AI tools, and how can professors best teach them how to use them? I am encouraging tools such as ChatGPT to help them get a leg up. But they are using it where it is perfectly evident to anyone reading that they have used ChatGPT.‚Äù Thanks for the question Dileep, and also for providing some context. You told me that you teach at a school where many students are from immigrant families and are working to fund their education. It seems you are struggling with the question of whether using generative AI as a shortcut to adequate work is helping them ‚Äúget a leg up,‚Äù as you say, or providing a deceptive impression that they have mastered a genuine skill. Let‚Äôs put aside the uses of ChatGPT to do information-gathering tasks like presenting a big picture on a subject or summarizing long texts‚Äîthese don‚Äôt seem too controversial. (I would say, however, that actually interacting directly with source material provides a deeper understanding that pays off in the long run.) The question for our times is how much students should rely on generative AI toproducetheir work. In one sense, it‚Äôs a repeat of the old argument over whether using calculators to do math work is cheating. The counterargument is that in the real world people no longer have to work things out on paper, and it is ridiculous to pretend that isn‚Äôt the case. That latter approach has won the day. But writing essays based on research and logic is a different situation. Organizing one‚Äôs research and presenting it as an argument is an effective way to train the mind to think empirically. Persuasive writing requires you to consider a skeptical reader‚Äôs point of view, and forces you to present arguments that are backed by evidence, in a succinct and powerful way. Mastering that skill hones your own mind. One can make the argument that ChatGPT and other products might ultimately negate the need to write essays, as if those LLMs were calculators for prose. But the idea isn‚Äôt to provide a bunch of words for some teacher to read‚Äîit‚Äôs to struggle through whatever process trains a mind to think logically and empathetically. So the problem isn't that ChatGPT essays are mediocre. Even if the output was fantastic, the fact would remain that there is minimal educational value in this shortcut. If your students want ‚Äúa leg up‚Äù in the world, they must do the difficult work of marshaling their evidence, mastering logic, and expressing those thoughts coherently. This will put them in good stead for everything they do in the workplace and beyond. For some of them this will be really difficult‚ÄîI used to teach freshman composition at a state school and have seen what a challenge it can be. Also, it will be really hard for you to convince them to ditch this magical new prosthesis called ChatGPT. But the payoff will be worth it. You can submit questions tomail@wired.com.

Can you imagine what a digital white ethnostate or a cyber caliphate might look like? Having spent most of my career on the inside of online extremist movements, I certainly can. The year 2024 might be the one in which neo-Nazis, jihadists, and conspiracy theorists turn their utopian visions of creating their own self-governed states into reality‚Äînot offline, but in the form of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs are digital entities that are collaboratively governed without central leadership and operate based on blockchain. They allow internet users to establish their own organizational structures, which no longer require the involvement of a third party in financial transactions and rulemaking. The World Economic Forumdescribed DAOsas ‚Äúan experiment to reimagine how we connect, collaborate and create‚Äù. However, as with all new technologies, there is also a darker side to them: They are likely to give rise to new threats emerging from decentralized extremist mobilization. Today, there are already over 10,000 DAOs, which collectively manage billions of dollars and count millions of participants. So far, DAOs have attracted a wild mix of libertarians, activists, pranksters, and hobbyists. Most DAOs I have come across in my research sound innocent and fun. Personally, my favorites include theCaf√©DAO, which aims ‚Äúto replace Starbucks‚Äù (good luck with that!); the Doge DAO, which wants to ‚Äúmake the Doge meme the most recognizable piece of art in the world‚Äù; and the HairDAO, ‚Äúa decentralized asset manager solving hair loss.‚Äù But some DAOs use a more radical tone. For example, the Redacted Club DAO, which is rife with alt-right codes and conspiracy myth references, claims to be a secret network with the aim of ‚Äúslaying‚Äù the ‚Äúevil Meta Lizard King.‚Äù This story is from theWIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the serieshere‚Äîordownloada copy of the magazine. The year 2024 might be one in which extremists start using DAOs strategically. Policies, legal contracts, and financial transactions that were traditionally the domain of governments, courts, and banks can be replaced with smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and cryptocurrencies. The use of anonymous bitcoin wallets and non-transparent cryptocurrencies such as Monero is already widespread among extremists whose bank accounts have been frozen. A shift to entirely decentralized forms of self-governance is only one step away. Beyond practical reasons that encourage extremists to create their own self-governed structures, there is an ideological incentive too: their fundamental distrust in the establishment. If you believe that the deep state or the ‚Äúglobal Jewish elites‚Äù control everything from governments and Big Tech to the global banking system, DAOs offer an appealing alternative. Conversations on far-right fringe platforms such as BitChute and Odysee reveal that there is much appetite for decentralized alternative forms of collaboration, communication, and crowdfunding. So what happens if anti-minority groups establish their own digital worlds in which they impose their own governing mechanisms? What are the stakes if trolling armies start cooperating via DAOs to launch election interference campaigns? The activities of extremist DAOs could challenge the rule of law, pose a threat to minority groups, and disrupt institutions that are currently considered fundamental pillars of democratic systems. Another risk is that DAOs can serve as safe havens for extremist movements by enabling users to circumvent government regulation and security services monitoring activities. They might also allow extremists to find new ways to fundraise, plan, and plot radicalization campaigns or even attacks. While many governments have focused on developing legal frameworks to regulate AI, few have even recognized the existence of DAOs. Their looming exploitation for extremist and criminal purposes is something that has flown under the radar of global policymakers. Technology expert Carl Miller, who has long warned of potential misuse of DAOs, told me that ‚Äúeven though DAOs behave like companies, they are not registered as legal entities.‚Äù There are only a few exceptions: The US states of Wyoming, Vermont, and Tennessee have passed laws to legally recognize DAOs. With no regulations in place to hold DAOs accountable for extremist or criminal activities, the big question for 2024 will be: How can we ensure the metaverse doesn‚Äôt give rise to digital white ethnostates or cyber caliphates?

It‚Äôs the cockroach of phone companies. The once huge LG made itssmartphone exitin 2021. HTC and Sony are just about clinging on by their fingertips. And yet the ultra-niche Vertu just recently announced a phone as bold and bombastic as anything it has made to date: theMetavertu. Itstartsat ¬£2,787 ($3,330), then tops out at a mind-boggling ¬£34,534 ($41,262) for theborderline offensiveHimalaya Alligator Leather 18K Gold & Diamond model. And that may not even be the most eye-opening part: Vertu markets this thing as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs first Web3 phone,‚Äù a claim that would set off alarm bells had they not already been ringing since first sight of the Vertu name. Why? Over the years, Vertu has been responsible for some of the mosttastelessandgaudyphones to roll off a production line. However, it started off as a Nokia side brand in 1998. Those early years gave us some undeniably striking phones, like the relatively elegantVertu Signaturefrom 2003. By 2012, Nokia‚Äôs phone market share had dropped from heights of 50.8 percent to under 5 percent. Vertu was sold to aprivate equity group, then bouncedbetween ownersfrom Turkey and China. This period saw a handful of handset designs that could be compared to handbags that hang around season after season in TJ Maxx stores (‚ÄúTK Maxx‚Äù if you‚Äôre outside of the US). There was a great deal of rampantly embossed leather and contours. Almost all Vertu phones have been criticized for their outdated tech and sky-high pricing. They are, and always have been, phones for people with more money than taste or sense. Vertu\\'s Metavertu ‚ÄúAlligator Leather Flame Red‚Äù‚Äîyours for ¬£5,408. However, the Vertu Metavertu feels quite different. It is a legit high-performance phone, and while the base design is pedestrian and some of its specs are slightly past their prime, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, components available at the phone‚Äôs October 2022 launch were notdrasticallybetter. The MetaVertu has a bold OLED screen and a responsive triple rear cameras that included a powerful 5x zoom. Its stereo speakers are loud, and just lack a little of the bass impact of the very best. My Metavertu review sample has 1 TB of storage and an almost over-the-top 18 GB of DDR5 RAM. It even comes with a tempered glass screen protector attached, perfectly matching the slick curved glass of the display‚Äîeven top-end phones use basic plastic protectors, if they have one at all. Surprisingly, this feels like a true flagship Android in a way no Vertu phone really has since the pre-iPhone era. But to look at Vertu as a company in 2023, it all makes very little sense. The company address that Vertu lists on its homepage is that of a single room on the fifth floor of an office block in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Search for it online and you‚Äôll also find an accountancy firm, a furniture exporter, an advertising agency, and a toy company all registered to the same ‚Äúroom 505.‚Äù Back in the old days, one of the key selling points of a Vertu phone was that it was ‚Äúmade in England.‚Äù The handsets were assembled at a small factory in Church Crookam, a village next to Fleet, in Hampshire, about 90 minutes‚Äô drive from London. However, that factory was demolished in 2020 to make way for asupermarket. According to Google Street View, you‚Äôll find Aldi and Home Bargains in the spot where Vertu‚Äôs old headquarters stood. Vertu‚Äôs days at that factory did not end well. ‚ÄúHere was a tech business where one day their landlords came into the HQ‚Äîthe factory you mentioned‚Äîand took away the toilet rolls, as they had not paid their bills,‚Äù says a source who worked with the brand for many years. ‚ÄúThe business collapsed, owing ¬£65 million ($80 million) and laying off 200 staff,‚Äù they told us. WIRED was unable to independently verify these numbers; however, at the time, the BBC andDaily Telegraphnewspaper reported that the money Vertu owed was even higher, at¬£128 million. While Vertu may still have ‚ÄúVertu England‚Äù on its Facebook posts, the brand has nothing to do with the UK anymore, besides trying to flog phones to the occasional rich person there. But if Vertu went bankrupt rather catastrophically in 2017, how is it alive today, with the sameGodin Holdingsfigure, Gary Chen (or Chen Gang), at its head giving the new phone\\'s launch presentation in 2022? The Metavertu has at least 10 references to ZTE in the phone‚Äôs hardware tags. A closer look at the phone reveals some clues. Hardware data scraper app Device Info uncovered at least 10 references to ZTE in the phone‚Äôs hardware tags‚Äîthe cameras, the battery, the ‚Äúbuilder‚Äù tag, and more. ZTE is a phone manufacturer known for both its own phones and ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) models, where a brand partners with a manufacturer in order to make use of their existing factories and supply chains. You provide the design specifics, they crank out the units. This was how phone networks like Vodafone made own-brand handsets. If the handset is made by ZTE, perhaps this is the only way making the Metavertu could have been viable, particularly as a smartphone likely to sell in tiny numbers? ‚ÄúVertu has changed hands lots of over the past decade, but is still being run by a bunch of folks based out of Hong Kong, very close to the Chinese supply chain,‚Äù says Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research. ‚ÄúThese folks with renewed focus are rebadging existing models from brands‚ÄîZTE, for example‚Äîwith luxury materials and advanced hardware and software.‚Äù Take another look at the Metavertu with this in mind, and you‚Äôll find it looks very similar to theZTE Nubia Z40 Profrom early 2022. They have\\xa0eerily similar camera sensors, lens and flash placement, processor, and display specs, and even share a red accented power button on the side. From the front they look nearly identical. Slap an expensive carbon fiber, ceramic, and sapphire backplate on the ¬£500 to ¬£800 Nubia Z40 Pro, and you‚Äôll get a Metavertu, more or less. And if this Basic Carbon Fiber ¬£2,915 ($3,592) design doesn‚Äôt do it for you‚Äîlooking, as it does, a little like an Asus ROG gaming phone‚Äîwhy not upgrade to thered alligator leatherversion for a mere ¬£6,073 ($7,464)? The Metavertu is no ordinary phone, for sure, but it would seem someone else has had a hand in the ‚Äúcreating extraordinary‚Äù factor you‚Äôll see mentioned on Vertu\\'s self-aggrandizing lock-screen images. This all leaves Vertu‚Äôs software as potentially the more substantive draw of the Metavertu experience. And given it is supposedly the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs first Web3 phone,‚Äù that makes sense. ‚ÄúThe positioning is ‚Äògeek luxury‚Äô‚Äîcompletely different versus the ‚Äòfashion luxury‚Äô of older Vertu phones,‚Äù says Shah. Classic Vertu models came with a concierge service, which was outsourced to a third-party company. The Metavertu still has a concierge of sorts, but this time it‚Äôs in the shape of hotel, air ticket, and restaurant reservation forms that quite literally link you to a Google Sheets page inside a Vertu Life app. The process is much like booking directly on a website for yourself, but is sure to put hackles up about privacy and security. Or at least it should. Alternatively, you can call the ‚Äúconcierge line‚Äù phone number, but this is exactly the same generic customer service number found published on Vertu‚Äôs own website. Luxury service, indeed. Still, the concierge service is old news. It‚Äôs not Web3; it‚Äôs not even Web 2.0. But what is a Web3 phone? Many of you may be wondering whatWeb3 even means. The term Web3 refers to technologies such as cryptocurrencies, ideas of turning video games into commodities marketplaces (more than they currently are), and pretty much anything to do with the blockchain. Now, Web3 has interesting potential and is a honeypot for venture capital investment, but is also replete with opportunists ready and willing to exploit the credulous. This VC clientele chimes with Vertu‚Äôs approach. ‚ÄúThe target market seems to be tech investors, investment bankers, crypto buffs, and so forth,‚Äù says Shah of the Metavertu‚Äôs seemingly ideal customer. Vertu owner Gary Chen played this angle hard at the phone‚Äôs London launch at the end of last year, which was attended by many crypto enthusiasts and fashion types, and barely any technology reporters. He spouted seemingly-endless meandering twaddle about Web3 while\\xa0at one point even misrepresented the phone itself. Contrary to the company head‚Äôs claims, for example, the Metavertu does have Google Play access. Web3 lives in the Metavertu as a stack of custom apps that range from the prosaic to the bizarre. They all sit in a password-protected Meta Space base app, which claims to be encrypted. You input a password to enter it, like a ‚Äúsecure‚Äù-file-store app you may have tried before. Inside, there‚Äôs a place to store your crypto wallet details, called Value. Vbox offers cloud storage. Dappstore is an app store that is, at the time of writing, empty aside from Vertu‚Äôs own stuff and a few web shortcuts posing as apps. Venture is a custom web browser whose homepage is stacked with crypto links, and VShot is a camera app that lets you ‚Äúmint‚Äù up to five images a day. This last one is sure to pick up some attention. Minting typically refers to the creation of anNFT. A phone that mints NFTs? That‚Äôs the dream (for some). However, while Vertu calls this an NFT camera, it appears to primarily be a way of proving copyright ownership by linking the file to a unique ID (DID). It‚Äôs not clear whether there‚Äôs any blockchain action going on here. Why can‚Äôt we tell you definitively? Vertu demands you supply not just your real name and either your drivers license number or passport number to use Vshot, but a picture of its information page and a picture of you holding your ID. You‚Äôre left waiting up to five minutes with the load bar spinning before you‚Äôll see this bizarre info request, too. If this doesn‚Äôt make you worried, it should. Vertu‚Äôs terms of service claims this ID is required by the People‚Äôs Republic of China, and goes on to leave one with the impression that maybe you shouldn‚Äôt bet the bank on any ‚Äúdue diligence‚Äù from Vertu in checking the apps made available through the Dapp store, among other worrying clauses. The entire poorly written script doesn‚Äôt quite reach the levels of ‚Äúif you use this software, you are on your own should something go wrong,‚Äù but let‚Äôs just say it isverydifferent from the T+Cs pages you\\'d expect from any ‚Äúnormal\" app store. We‚Äôre certainly not in the Google Play Store anymore. Never before have I used a phone where I felt so unsafe, one that feels like itcouldbe used to scam me‚Äîthough, to be clear, I have no evidence that it is. This really is a Web3 phone, then, just perhaps not in the sense the aspiring crypto bros hoped for. If you‚Äôre about to dismiss this as anti-Web3 paranoia, just wait a minute. Right now at least two versions of Vertu exist online. There‚Äôs theVertuthat makes the Metavertu, based in Hong Kong and China, andVertu AK France. Vertu AK France accuses the current Chinese incarnation of Vertu of ‚Äúmassive accounting and financial fraud‚Äùon its website, and claims to be the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Vertu online while selling classic Vertu handsets that must have been manufactured years ago. Vertu AK France is not your classic underdog, though. It is owned by Hakan Uzan, a man exiled from Turkey amid fraud investigations that led to219 companiesunder the Uzan umbrella being seized, and his brotherCem Uzanbeing sentenced in absentia to 23 years in prison for racketeering. Members of the Uzan family have been living in France, having been granted political asylum. In 2021, Hakan and Cem Uzanattempted to sueVodafone, Motorola, BlackRock, and other entities for a combined $68 billion for those assets seized almost two decades prior. The Metavertu ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù Carbon Fiber handset and the flagship Himalaya Alligator Leather 18K Gold & Diamonds model, which costs ¬£34,534. WIRED contacted Vertu AK France in an attempt for clarification. Vertu AK France did not respond. We asked Vertu in Hong Kong to provide proof of ownership and explain how both itandVertu AK France could claim to own the Vertu brand. In response, Vertu Hong Kong gave us documentation appearing to show that it has owned the trademark for the name ‚ÄúVertu\" in more than 40 countries but notably not in France. This leaves Vertu in the position where two companies are claiming ownership of the brand, each accusing the other of substantial fraud. Metavertu‚Äôs luxury facade is a fragile illusion, and the Vertu story just gets weirder the closer you look. As pleasant as the Metavertu is to use, we do not want to hand over our passport details just to use its questionable software features, and you shouldn‚Äôt either.

As cryptocurrencies riseand fall, there‚Äôs one number that just keeps going up. Whenever somebody loses money to a crypto scam or hack, the Grift Counter on Molly White‚Äôs blog,Web3 Is Going Just Great, spins higher and higher. Recently it ticked over $12 billion. White started the blog in December 2021 out of frustration with the mainstream coverage of crypto,\\xa0which she says paid too much attention to rags-to-riches tales and not enough to its dark underbelly. Her goal was to paint a fuller picture, to chronicle the thefts and failures, debunk the marketing spiel, and underline the risks in the process. A software engineer by trade, White codedWeb3 Is Going Just Greatover the span of a few weeks. It was only a side project, designed to ‚Äúentertain me and me alone,‚Äù says White; she never imagined it would gain any traction. But within a few months, the blog had become a viral hit, earning White a reputation as an authoritative crypto pundit. When she first learned about crypto at a conference in college in the early 2010s, White admired the pro-privacy and anti-censorship principles on which it was founded. She was enthusiastic, she says, about its potential to shield dissidents and whistleblowers from financial surveillance and to help women confined to abusive relationships by financial dependence. However, by the time crypto reappeared on White‚Äôs radar a decade later, those ideas had been all but erased‚Äîreplaced with an emphasis on maximizing personal profit. Online, the rocket ship emoji was being cast about as an instrument of hype, and ‚Äúno coiners‚Äù were being told to ‚Äúhave fun staying poor,‚Äù as record numbers of people were drawn into crypto. As a result, examples of the technology being used for good are ‚Äúeclipsed‚Äù by the number of people who have lost money, says White. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs moving the web and society in a really negative direction.‚Äù When White startedWeb3 Is Going Just Great, crypto was on a hot streak and people were making a lot of money, which meant she found herself ‚Äúraining on the parade of people who weren‚Äôt willing to be rained on,‚Äù she says. Threats, slurs, and personal insults began to tumble into her inbox. As a long-time Wikipedia editor, White had experienced abuse before, including threats of doxing and violence toward family members over entries she had authored on the American far right. Nonetheless, it still ‚Äúreally sucks,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why this type of behavior happens: to discourage people from being critical. A lot of people decide it‚Äôs not worth it.‚Äù But in 2022, White and her fellow critics had their moment. A calamitous year for crypto was punctuated by a series of collapses, each dealing a cumulative blow to trust in the sector. In May, the failure of the Terra Luna stablecoin prompted a chain reaction that took down hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, crypto lender Celsius, and others. In November came the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, whose founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been charged with 12 criminal offenses, including fraud and money laundering. White says she felt somewhat vindicated by what happened, but that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a good feeling‚Äù because regular people lost billions of dollars. At best, the fallout acted as a ‚Äúuseful example‚Äù of the risks White had been trying to highlight‚Äîexamples she hopes policy makers will take heed of. In the wake of the FTX collapse, efforts to regulate the crypto industry have received increased attention. The chief goals are to prevent people from losing money to fraudulent projects and to give legitimate crypto businesses a clear set of boundaries within which to operate. White, who gave a statement in July to the US Treasury‚Äôs Financial Stability Oversight Council, says the events of last year will help politicians realize that crypto is not something that can be simply ignored. Although she is ‚Äúnot necessarily optimistic‚Äù about the trajectory of efforts to regulate the industry, because of the strength of the crypto lobby, White hopes her work can still make a difference. Occasionally, White resents the obligation to think, write, and speak about crypto when she could instead be doing something that drives in a positive direction. But then she reminds herself: ‚ÄúSometimes, the most important thing is to not let the wheels turn in reverse.‚Äù This article first appeared in the July/August 2023 issue of WIRED UK In your inbox:Ourbiggest stories, handpicked for you each day The far-right Sheriffs ready todisrupt the election The Big Interview:Marissa Mayer‚ÄîI am a software girl Here‚Äôs whatthe regenerative cities of tomorrowcould look like Election:Follow WIRED's election coverage atWIRED.com/politics More From WIRED Reviews and Guides ¬©2024Cond√© Nast.

Another day, anothercryptocurrency meltdown. Even the most ardent blockchain boosters will admit that the vast majority of what WIRED recently called the ‚Äúflashing-neon crypto casino‚Äù of memecoins, NFT drops, and DeFi projects will ultimately gopoofand take almost everyone‚Äôs money with it. The question we‚Äôve been trying to answer in our journalism is: What is the tiny percentage that will remain and be actually useful? In a TED talk last month, whichwent online today, Instagram boss Adam Mosseri offered what felt, at first blush at least, like one of the more compelling answers. One much-touted promise of Web3 is that it will let ordinary internet users truly own their data‚Äîand store it on a blockchain no single entity controls, instead of having it harvested and monetized by giant tech companies. Most examples of how this would work have been pretty abstract up to now, but Mosseri offered more specifics by describing how content creators‚Äîmusicians, writers, artists, vloggers, and the like‚Äîmight use Web3 to gain a measure of independence from dominant platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and yes, even Instagram. In Mosseri‚Äôs vision, a hypothetical country-music singer called Lisa sells her fans subscriptions, not to Facebook or YouTube or TikTok, but to herself. She issues tokens on a blockchain that give the bearer access to all her music wherever it lives online. The platforms still host the music, but they no longer control Lisa‚Äôs relationship with her subscribers. They can‚Äôt decide what data she sees, sell her subscribers‚Äô data to third parties, or suddenly hike their cut of her income. If she decides to stop using a platform‚Äîor if the platform itself kicks her off, or goes bust‚Äîshe doesn‚Äôt lose her subscriber list. In the talk, Mosseri said this would mark ‚Äúa dramatic shift in power away from platforms like [Instagram] and to ‚Ä¶ creators.‚Äù He also hypothesized that creators could use this method as a form of equity crowdfunding‚Äîwhipping up investment early on in their careers from fans who would get a share of their income later. But how will this work in practice? How much independence would Lisa really gain‚Äîand what would she lose? And why would giant companies like the one Mosseri works for agree to give up their power? We caught up with him after the talk and asked him to flesh out his vision‚Äîwhich, he conceded, is ‚Äúless likely to happen than it is not to happen.‚Äù This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. WIRED: The idea that you're proposing epitomizes one of the central promises of Web3, which is to give people control over their data. It sounds very enticing for content creators, but all the platforms would have to agree to it. Why would it be in their best interest, and what would make them cede that control? Adam Mosseri:I'm not sure that they will. But let me clarify‚Äîthe idea [of sharing data] is not just about portable subscriptions. Every platform has an interest for the creator ecosystem to be built on a stable financial base. I don't think it is right now. There are a lot of creators out there. They make money by way of a jerry-rigged group of tools. Over the long run, you want to see more stability and an economic foundation for the creator ecosystem. I think platforms will be giving up some short-term control for there to be a larger pie in the long run. A big risk is the size of the market for subscriptions. Is there going to be a meaningful opportunity for a million creators, for 10 million creators, 50 million creators? On the internet, everyone's famous to 15 people. Exactly. How much could that affect business for a platform like YouTube, or Instagram for that matter? They are selling ads based on people's views. You have to differentiate between the platform subscription and the creator subscription. So my idea would be for a subset of creators to use platforms like YouTube and Instagram to build up a brand and demand for what they do. They could post to whatever platform they want, and give away however much they want for free. But they would also have a group of people who subscribe to them, and that relationship is built in a way that no platform can take it away. At TED you talked about freeing people from the tyranny of platforms and giving them control of their data. Facebook, now Meta, has fought that idea for years, notably when itrefused to participatein Open Social, the proposed alliance where people would have ownership of their contacts and friend connections. Do you acknowledge that 180-degree turn? I definitely acknowledge that historical tension. There's a fundamental tension between a centralized platform [like ours] and decentralized technologies like blockchain. And I acknowledge the potential between our position on things like Open Social, and things like the subscription idea, but I'm not saying everything should be interoperable, or that all data should flow from platform to platform. There are very real reasons for that, privacy being paramount. So does this mean Meta will be willing to let people take their connections and favorites with them? I'm talking specifically about financial relationships. That's a case where the benefits are significant and the costs [to Meta] are less significant. There might be others too, I don't know. I don't have any that I want to say on the record, and I have yet to think about them a bit more. There's a tension there. But the world is changing. The greatest risk a platform faces is not competition, though competition is a huge risk. It is that the world changes to make what you do irrelevant because you are not willing to lean in and change along with the world. And we've seen that for many large companies in many industries. So yeah, this is a different approach than we have historically taken. That just shows that we're open to embracing where the world is going. You are tying these changes to a blockchain-based system. But what stopped previous cross-platform initiatives was not the technology but the refusal of companies to work together. If everyone agrees to do your idea now, why do you need to use the blockchain? In this case, the blockchain makes sense because blockchains are immutable. The record is public and available to everyone forever, so we literally cannot delete the thing. That gives weight to the assurance that we cannot take this [subscriber] relationship away from you. Yes, we could absolutely build this on non-blockchain technologies using something like OAuth. But the assurances would carry less weight at a time where trust in institutions has declined. So you're saying that you could have done it earlier, but it was good to wait for blockchain because no one would have believed you otherwise? I'm not saying that. But there is a truth to that framing. It has less to do with blockchain and more to do with competition in the market for creators, and us feeling a sense of urgency for being the de facto platform for them. Instagram specifically has enjoyed immense market fit with creators for a very long time. Now, a lot of other platforms have wised up to the value of creators. As more power shifted from institutions to individuals, the competition for creators and creators' business has exploded. And it has created a strong incentive for us to do way more to help creators make a living directly, as opposed to indirectly. Traditionally, creators build an audience, and they monetize that audience. Branded content on Instagram is probably a $15 billion industry, roughly‚ÄîI don't know, many billions of dollars. Now we're building more ways for creators to make a living. So we announced the first test of NFTs this week, performed tests around affiliate marketing, experimented with revenue sharing and longer-form video. We launched subscriptions, which we are still testing. ‚ÄúIf we agree with those who say we shouldn't build anything new as long as anything bad ever happens on Instagram, then we're never going to build anything new ever again.‚Äù Let's talk about your hypothetical country singer, Lisa. She sells a subscription to her content on all platforms as blockchain tokens. But pretty much every major use of a blockchain also requires some other intermediary services: Lisa probably wants software that connects transactions to a list of actual subscribers so she can grant them access to her content. And maybe she needs a CRM, and maybe she needs analytics. And she also still depends on the platforms themselves to distribute her content. Their algorithms can boost or suppress her stuff, or take it off, or the platforms can go bust. So isn't Lisa just as beholden to centralized platforms as before, and in some ways even worse off? She doesn't necessarily have control over everything, but she's on the hook for everything. I strongly disagree with the characterization at the end. But I agree with everything before that. In this world, yes, she has dependencies. But the idea here is that she has options, and she can move without losing her community. For instance, she could swap payment providers, she could move platforms‚Äîif she gets kicked off Twitter, she could start using YouTube, and she would still maintain all the relationships with all her subscribers. Yes, there's an expectation that her subscribers have of her, but she has way more independence. I would also point out that subscribers can vote with their pocket, so if she doesn't produce good content, they will stop paying, presumably. That's actually a healthy incentive. Blockchain is a public record of transactions. Theoretically, it's anonymous, but if somebody wants to badly enough, they could probably figure out who your subscribers are. If it's country music subscribers, it probably doesn't matter. But if Lisa makes BDSM videos, or has a radical political newsletter, that's different. Also, Lisa's competitors might find it useful to know who's subscribing to her or how many subscribers she has. How does she protect that information? There are a bunch of really interesting privacy implications and trade-offs about what you store on the publicly accessible blockchain. Maybe it's anonymized and hashed, but it's publicly accessible, so you can count the number of subscribers. It's going to be one of the more interesting things as we try to design this system, in collaboration with the community. You're pointing out a potential downside. There's always the risk that something gets implemented improperly. But I think a world where you might be able to get more fans because you can move from platform to platform outweighs the downside of people knowing how many subscribers you have. I'm not trying to pretend there are no downsides. This idea is clearly less likely to happen than it is not to happen. But it would be amazing if it happened, and I think we should be taking swings like this. I'm sure some critics will note that while you're talking about blockchain and NFTs, Instagram still has tremendous challenges in content moderation, and its algorithms radicalize people against their wishes. We can work on more than one thing at once. Yes, we have responsibilities to keep people safe, and to be thoughtful about algorithmic responsibility. But we also have a responsibility to deliver value to the people who use Instagram, whether they be creators or average folk. Safety is incredibly important, but if we agree with those who say we shouldn't build anything new as long as anything bad ever happens on Instagram, then we're never going to build anything new ever again. With well over a billion people on our platform, even if we were an order of magnitude better, something bad will happen to someone somewhere. That is the harsh reality of what it means to be a large platform. Your vision doubles down on creator content, and presumably will become more of the Instagram experience. But what about the poor schmoes who aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcreators‚Äù but just want to share things with their friends? Would they get driven out when your algorithm prioritizes the attention-getting behavior that comes from broadening monetization from sponsors to creators? Friends are always going to be an important part of using Instagram. We're going to continue to value friend content very highly in Feed and Stories, but they're never going to drive most of the time spent on the platform. The most interesting opportunity for us is to be at the intersection of friends and creators, where people can discover things to talk about with their friends. I'm making a huge push to shift more of our ranking toward what we call ‚Äúexploration-based ranking methodologies‚Äù to try and help you discover new things to do. We haven't been good at this historically. By far the leader in creative monetization has been YouTube, and by far the leader on finding new talent has been TikTok. That's something that I want to correct. It sounds as if you're more excited about this new model of monetization than targeting ads to users, which is the entire underlying business model of Facebook and Instagram. No, they're both valuable. The benefit of an advertising-based business model is that you can provide a free service to over a billion people worldwide. Some people use it to stay in touch with loved ones, other people use it to make a living, or at least to just pass the time. All of those things are valuable. That doesn't mean I don't like subscriptions as a business. Both business models have merit. What‚Äôs the time frame for these things? It's going to take a long time. I'd be pumped if something like this happened in a few years. As for the investing-in-people idea thatI outlined in the talk, I'd be pumped if it happens in six or seven years at scale. I think it's more likely 10 years.

Kenzie Carpenter firstdecided to choose a Fannish Next-of-Kin when an online friend, whom she knew as XT, died suddenly. ‚ÄúI had met her in a small, tight-knitDiscordserver for our shared fandom,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHer death was a shock to all of us.‚Äù FNOK arrangements allow users of the popular fan-fiction website Archive of Our Own todesignateanother fan to take control of their works‚Äîthings like fan fiction, fan art, essays, and videos‚Äîafter they die. Carpenter had heard of the policy before, but it was XT‚Äôs death‚Äîand the suggestion from a fellow server member that they all consider naming a FNOK‚Äîthat spurred her into action. AO3remains an outlier in\\xa0Carpenter‚Äôs digital life: She has no such arrangements on other platforms, partly because none of them have a feature that lets you easily leave your posts in the hands of a like-minded friend. ‚ÄúIf more sites had the functionality AO3 has\\xa0and a similarly simple process, I would probably set something up just to make it easier on my spouse,‚Äù she says, clarifying that he does have access to her computer and she trusts him with her online presence. It‚Äôs now common practice to leave a ‚Äúsocial media will‚Äù with login information and postmortem wishes, but without one, immediate family members or people legally designated to act on behalf of an estate are often the only ones who can control a deceased user‚Äôs online accounts. Generally, that just means taking a profile down, since most platforms will not grant access to anyone but the user. Some platforms, notably Facebook and Instagram, allow non-family members to ‚Äúmemorialize‚Äù a profile; Facebooknow also permitsusers to designate a ‚Äúlegacy contact‚Äù who can do things like change their profile photo or put up a remembrance post after they‚Äôve died. The things you‚Äôve bought or earned online can‚Äôt be passed on after death‚Äîon a gaming platform like Steam, for example, you are licensing the right to use the software, and that right isnon-transferable. Most platforms have little to say about the contentcreatedby the deceased‚Äîperhaps because most platforms are in the business of signing up and retaining users, not preserving the things those users have created. In most sites‚Äô terms of service, an individual holds the copyright to their content while licensing the platform to use it; when a person dies, that copyright passes to their heirs, just like with any other type of media. Regardless of ownership, that content usually remains untouched, if it stays online at all; one notable exception isTwitch, where the people running a streamer‚Äôs accountcan keep posting for themafter they die.TikTok, arguably the biggest well of content creation on the web in 2023, has no publicly-listed postmortem policies at all. Fans spend time on all of these platforms, but for a lot of them, immediate family members would be less-than-ideal stewards of the works they‚Äôve created. Fandom can be a space to explore things you might not share with people in your non-fandom life‚Äîsexual and gender identities, for example, or maybe just weird rabbit holes that only make sense to fellow fans. Without context, fanworks might not seem like something worth preserving‚Äîa problem that long predates the web. Many fanzines and other collections have been lost forever; as theFannish Estate Planningarticle on the communal wiki Fanlore puts it, family members of deceased fans often ‚Äúhave no idea what they are looking at, and sadly, much fannish material ends up in the trash and other inglorious destinations.‚Äù When AO3 was being built a decade and a half ago, many of the site‚Äôs creators had already lost fandom friends‚Äîand as a result, they‚Äôd also lost their friends‚Äô fanworks. ‚ÄúFNOKs were brought up very early on, as they were starting to discuss what sorts of things they wanted in the terms of service,‚Äù says Heather Smith, AO3‚Äôs policy and abuse committee cochair and primary FNOK facilitator. ‚ÄúPeople also had the question of how their own works would be handled after they were gone, so the OTW [the Organization for Transformative Works, AO3‚Äôs parent organization] wanted some sort of arrangement that would benefit both creators and fans.‚Äù Though FNOK set-up is straightforward, only a small fraction of the site‚Äôs millions of users have put one in place. ‚ÄúWe hope that an FNOK arrangement is something users take seriously, that both people in an arrangement trust each other a lot and have talked about the possible future of becoming incapacitated together,‚Äù Smith says. But, she adds, ‚ÄúI think the majority of our users will never decide to set one up.‚Äù Smith herself created one when she joined the FNOK team in 2020‚Äîa year that saw a significant increase in requests. ‚ÄúCovid-19seemed to have put that possibility at the forefront of everyone‚Äôs minds,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúFor me, it helped make the conversation easier to bring up. Everyone had thought about it at least once that year, and it was a small relief to know my existence on the Archive would be handled by someone I trusted.‚Äù FNOK arrangements are one of several ways AO3 users‚Äô creations can be preserved independently of the user. Nearly half a million of the site‚Äôs 10-million-plus works have been ‚Äúorphaned,‚Äù remaining online but severed from the account that posted them. Orphaning is an act of permanence on a web full of broken links and abandoned profiles, deliberately putting the work in the hands of the Archive itself. Both features create a sense of the platform as a communally constructed space‚Äîone that‚Äôs built to outlast any individual. This stands in contrast to the increasingly precarious feel of a lot of our digital platforms. From the slow, occasionally chaotic decline of Twitter to the ever-expanding detritus left behind from earlier eras of the web, the connections we make online and the places where we put our creations can feel ephemeral, subject to the whims of corporations or ultrarich individuals. Even with her affairs in order on the AO3, Carpenter feels this acutely in the rest of her digital life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm constantly terrified that Automattic will suddenly decide Tumblr‚Äôs not worth it and shut it down overnight, and my past 11 years on the site will be erased in the flip of a switch,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be like losing my journals and photo albums, letters from friends, scrapbooks, keepsakes, and things like that to a house fire.‚Äù As we build the next era of the web, proponents of decentralized, communally created and owned spaces would be well served to take a page out of the AO3‚Äôs book. The people pitching our digital future in themetaversecan feel like they‚Äôrebroadcasting a cash grab‚Äîand the resolutely noncommercial AO3, where works are written, shared, and passed to Fannish-Next-of Kin wholly for free, might feel like an unlikely comparison. But there are parallels between what AO3 does and the ideas of people like Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin,who proposesusing distributed ledgers not just for financial transactions, but to build webs of trusted connections and experiences to serve as a sort of digital identity. On AO3, small connections like the FNOK are expressions of trust between peers, and they serve to strengthen the whole: a signal that the death of a person you only know online won‚Äôt just mean an inactive account, and a promise that the space you are building together will outlast you both. I asked Carpenter, who is in her mid-twenties, if she felt her FNOK arrangement was incongruous with a web generally defined by impermanence. ‚ÄúPeople have been writing ‚ÄòI was here‚Äô graffiti in random places for thousands of years,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúThere is something permanent about designating a FNOK, I agree. But there‚Äôs something even more permanent about losing all evidence that you were online at all.‚Äù In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-tested gear Abitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Story:An oral history ofWIRED‚Äôs original website I madea wholesome OnlyFansto try to make ends meet Event:Join us forWIRED Healthon March 18 in London More From WIRED Reviews and Guides ¬©2024Cond√© Nast.

Martin Shkreli‚Äîthe notoriousex-pharmaceutical executivefresh from prisonafter his2017 fraud conviction‚Äîannounced his latest, eyebrow-raising venture this week: the creation of ablockchain-basedWeb3drug discovery platform that traffics in his owncryptocurrency, MSI, akaMartin Shkreli Inu. This story originally appeared onArs Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Cond√© Nast. The platform, still in the early development phase, is calledDruglike, according toa press releasethat circulated on July 25. Its goals are ostensibly lofty, but the details are extremely sketchy, and Shkreli‚Äôs intentions have already drawn skepticism. It‚Äôs also unclear whether the enterprise will run Shkreli afoul of hislifetime ban from the pharmaceutical industry, which stemmed from the abrupt and callous 4,000 percent price hike of a life-saving drug that made him infamous. Shkreli, who is named as a cofounder ofDruglike, says the platform aims to make early-stage drug discovery more affordable and accessible. ‚ÄúDruglike will remove barriers to early-stage drug discovery, increase innovation and allow a broader group of contributors to share the rewards,‚Äù Shkreli said in the press release. ‚ÄúUnderserved and underfunded communities, such as those focused on rare diseases or in developing markets, will also benefit from access to these tools.‚Äù Generally, early-stage drug development can sometimes involve virtual screens to identify potential drug candidates. In these cases, pharmaceutical scientists first identify a ‚Äútarget‚Äù‚Äîa specific compound or protein that plays a critical role in developing a disease or condition. Then researchers look for compounds or small molecules that could interfere with that target, sometimes binding or ‚Äúdocking‚Äù directly to the target in a way that keeps it from functioning. This can be done in physical labs using massive libraries of compounds in high-throughput chemical screens. But it can also be done virtually, using specialized software and a lot of computing power, which can be resource-intensive. That‚Äôs where Shkreli‚Äôs Druglike is imagined to come in. Ina white paperposted onDruglike‚Äôs website, Shkreli-associated Jason Sommer lays out some concepts for how the company‚Äôs platform would work. Essentially, it would use a decentralized computing network of task providers, solvers, and validators that would run and optimize the virtual screening of drug candidates. The white paper draws similarities toFoldIt, an online puzzle gamethat essentially uses distributed computing and crowdsourcing to fold proteins and predict their structures. But Druglike‚Äôs platform is touted as incorporating blockchain concepts and cryptocurrency transactions when users complete tasks, such as docking screens. For instance, the paper describes a ‚Äúproof-of-optimization‚Äù concept as a ‚Äúnovel‚Äù blockchain-based verification step for screening work, similar to Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúproof-of-work‚Äù method. ‚ÄúWe propose a blockchain-based implementation of Proof-of-Optimization, where a distributed ledger stores records of which proof solutions belong to which Solvers. Smart contracts allow secure distribution of rewards to the Solver who owns the verified proof,‚Äù Sommer writes in the paper. But, for now, the white paper only loosely describes these concepts, and it‚Äôs unclear how the cryptocurrency transactions will generate value. It‚Äôs also unclear how the project will be funded, though an online exchange suggested that the company could lookfor venture capital financing. On Twitter, where Shkreli has been banned, he currently has an account asEnrique Hernandez @zkEnrique7. From there,Shkreli announced the company on July 25andhosted a conversation regarding the project. In that conversation, he scoffed at the idea that the platform would breach his lifetime ban from the pharmaceutical industry, saying that the project only involves developing software, not drugs. ‚ÄúWriting some code in Github and pressing ‚Äògo‚Äô does not make you a pharmaceutical company,‚Äù he said.

Like many nerdsbefore me, I spent a goodly portion of my life searching for the perfectcomputing system. I wanted a single tool that would let me write prose or programs, that could search every email, tweet, or document in a few keystrokes, and that would work across all my devices. I yearned to summit the mythic Mt. Augment, to achieve the enlightenment of a properly orchestrated personal computer. Where thesoftware industryoffered notifications, little clicks and dings, messages jumping up and down on my screen like a dog begging for a treat, I wanted calm textuality. Seeking it, I tweaked. I configured. The purpose of configuration is to make a thing work with some other thing‚Äîto make the to-do list work with the email client, say, or the calendar work with the other calendar. It's an interdisciplinary study. Configuration can be as complex as programming or as simple as checking a box. Everyone talks about it, but it's not taken that seriously, because there's not much profit in it. And unfortunately, configuration is indistinguishable from procrastination. A little is fine but too much is embarrassing. I spent almost three decades configuring my text editor, amassing 20 or so dotfiles that would make one acronym or nonsense word concordant with another. (For me: i3wm + emacs + org-mode + notmuch + tmux, bound together with ssh + git + Syncthing + Tailscale.) I'd start down a path, but then there'd be some blocker‚Äîsome bug I didn't understand, some page of errors I didn't have time to deal with‚Äîand I'd give up. A big problem I had was where to put my stuff. I tried different databases, folder structures, private websites, cloud drives, and desktop search tools. The key, finally, was to turn nearly everything in my life into emails. All my calendar entries, essay drafts, tweets‚ÄîI wrote programs that turned them into gigs and gigs of emails. Emails are horrible, messy, swollen, decrepit forms of data, but they are understood by everything everywhere. You can lard them with attachments. You can tag them. You can add any amount of metadata to them and synchronize them with servers. They suck, but they work. No higher praise. It took years to get all these emails into place, tag them, filter them just so. Little by little I could see more of the shape of my own data. And as I did this, software got better and computers got faster. Not only that, other people started sharingtheirconfig files on GitHub. Then, one cold day‚ÄîJanuary 31, 2022‚Äîsomething bizarre happened. I was at home, writing a little glue function to make my emails searchable from anywhere inside my text editor. I evaluated that tiny program and ran it. It worked. Somewhere in my brain, I felt a distinctclick. I was done. No longer configuring, but configured. The world had conspired to give me what I wanted. I stood up from the computer, suffused with a sort of European-classical-composer level of emotion, and went for a walk. Was this happiness? Freedom? Or would I find myself back tomorrow, with a whole new set of requirements? The more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äùa piece of software is intended to be, the more likely it is to be scriptable. CAD tools or 3D programs will provide whole languages just for configuration. But the huge consumer products, the operating systems themselves, are more and more locked down. The reasons are multiple‚Äîmoney, security, simplicity. A lot of our computing is done on someone else's terms. We describe it with carceral words. To assert control over your device, you ‚Äújailbreak‚Äù out. I wonder if this is one of the reasons people get intocrypto‚Äîthey dream of a new world that can be customized like software. Programmable money, self-executing contracts, little scripts that rearrange reality. In DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), people use code to make social rules, then buy or do things with their consolidated digital might. A lot of my friends hate all this stuff (perhapsNFTsmore than DAOs) with great passion; they see it as a closing off, a betrayal of the open, trust-driven nature of the early web. Others love it, seeing it as a continuation of the community-building, empowering nature of the early web. What I see is a generation of configurers coming into their own. Older web folks expected to create the new digital economy; these younger ones are trying to create the neweconomyeconomy. Their dream is a more perfect union where humans will, because of computers, stop acting in the ways we've been acting since we came out of the trees. Then again, $200 million in NFTs were stolen the day I drafted this column. When in history have we been able to schedule folly? Sometimes the only way to end the vacation is to drive the RV off a cliff. Perhaps by the time you read this the NFTs will have been returned. That would be a good reconfiguration. But the likely outcome of the boom is that some people will cash out at the right time and become convinced that they hold the keys to the universe and will lecture us for the rest of our lives, and most people (like those who had their NFTs stolen) will be humbled, or at best break even. When in history have we been able to schedule folly? Sometimes the only way to end the vacation is to drive the RV off a cliff. While the youth reconfigure society, I'm done configuring. A month has gone by since theclick, and the urge to tweak is gone. My system looks like something from the '80s (a lot of itisfrom the '80s), but I finally got my room just the way I like it. Here's what I mean. Say I search for the word ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù; 7,222 emails pop up. Most are from marketers and industry mailing lists proclaiming some technological triumph, but nestled among them are messages from me, or to me, about learning to use databases‚ÄîXML databases, SQL databases, and so forth. When I read these old messages, I am always surprised at how little I've changed, how consistent my obsessions are. There's something valuable to me in justseeingthat, in seeing how the world keeps trumpeting the new while the self stays the same. You'd think there'd be at least five new me's by now, given how often I've vowed to become better. But no. I've been writing about configuring my text editor since 1996. I've been running my mouth about databases at least that long. They say you can't dip your hand in the same river twice, but they rarely mention that it's the same hand doing the dipping. Since the emails are, well, just emails, sometimes I hit Reply (by typing ‚Äúr‚Äù). On a thread that went dormant a decade ago. I don't always offer context. Sometimes I just write, ‚ÄúCurious ‚Ä¶ how did this turn out?‚Äù I used to feel I was intruding, to just drop in like that. But what the hell. It's been a long pandemic. No one has to write back. Out go the emails. Most get no reply; some get a bounce-back. But often enough, people respond at length. Some left the city and came back. Some are up for coffee. A surprising number are now cyborgs (pacemakers, hearing aids). Some are rich, some are broke, some are divorced. One is considering being frozen after death, some are considering getting into crypto, and one has moved to Miami. None of us understand our children. I'm thinking of starting a Sunday morning waffle breakfast forvaccinatedpeople to come stare at each other. It's one thing to email after 10 years, but everyone appreciates an invitation to breakfast. Maybe I'll set up some sort of internet-connected LED scrolly screen, like they put on food carts, so out-of-towners can leave messages. I gotta havesomethingto configure. If you'd asked me, back when I was still configuring, not yet configured, exactly why I was nurturing these dozens of dotfiles, I'd have had a hard time telling you. I would have said: I want a pure and sleek experience. I want the computer working for me, augmenting my dumb brain with its immense arithmetical speed. I want access to my whole digital self. So I am very surprised that the terminal result of my efforts is not some sort of ecstatic communion with the internet, or even with my own computer. The function of my whole big orchestrated, tagged, integrated system was merely to rekindle old ties. What was all that configuration for? It was, in all sincerity, for waffles.

It's getting lateon a Saturday afternoon in Denver when I lean back and take in the full weirdness of what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm seated at a long plastic folding table against the wall in a windowless room, a Discord server open on my laptop. Pizza crusts and empty potato chip bags are piled up around me, evidence of the feverish hours I‚Äôve spent hacking together a project with a trio ofblockchaindevelopers. I‚Äôm not a programmer, just a journalist with a law degree. Yet somehow I‚Äôve gotten swept up in creating my own DAO‚Äîa decentralized autonomous organization, a favorite concept among the starry-eyed proponents ofWeb3‚Äîand it‚Äôs supposed to launch tomorrow. No doubt you have questions. So do I. Like: What happened to me? Three days ago I was a crypto skeptic who could barely figure out how to buy ether. Now I‚Äôm speaking in complete sentences about multisig treasuries and quadratic voting. The devs have almost integrated our site with non-MetaMask wallets, and I‚Äôve just dropped $85 for a domain on the Ethereum Name Service despite having no clear use for it. And rather than feeling exasperated or baffled, I seem to have caught the same thrill, however fleetingly, as everyone around me. I am among the estimated 10,000 people who arrived in Colorado a few days ago for this year‚Äôs ETHDenver conference, the biggest and oldest event in the world ofEthereumand Web3. Most of these folks came here to be among their people. I came to try to understand them. And I think I finally do. The term Web3,as you may or may not have noticed, emerged from obscurity last year, buoyed by rising cryptocurrency prices and some canny marketing by venture capitalists. Its meaning is hard to pin down. In the media and on Twitter, Web3 has become a catchall for anything having to do with blockchains and cryptocurrency: People paying tens of thousands of dollars for digital collectibles known as non-fungible tokens, orNFTs, with neither practical nor aesthetic value, then flipping them for even ungodlier sums.‚ÄúPlay-to-earn‚Äù video gamesthat lure gamers into flimsy virtual worlds with the promise of riches. Celebrities shilling crypto exchanges during the Super Bowl. A ceaseless parade ofscams,hacks, andfrauds. But to a core of true believers, Web3 stands apart from the garish excesses and brazen misbehavior of the flashing-neon crypto casino. If cryptocurrency was originally about decentralizing money, Web3 is about decentralizing ‚Ä¶ everything. Its mission is almost achingly idealistic: to free humanity not only from Big Tech domination but also from exploitative capitalism itself‚Äîand to do it purely through code. Bitcoin, the original blockchain-based cryptocurrency, created a way to send and receive digital money without needing a bank to approve those transactions. Instead of regulators and cops, a set of carefully designed incentives would, in theory, keep everyone acting in the best interests of all Bitcoin users. Web3 aims to apply these two concepts‚Äîdecentralization and game theory‚Äîto all of digital life. The main vehicle for this is Ethereum, a blockchain that borrowed Bitcoin‚Äôs key features and added a major innovation: It was designed with its own programming language so developers could build apps, and eventually a whole new decentralized digital infrastructure, to run on it. If Bitcoin attracts anarcho-capitalists who want to dethrone the central bankers, the culture around Ethereum and Web3 has a more progressive bent. After I walked into the Denver Sports Castle, a massive former sporting goods store turned events space that served as ETHDenver‚Äôs main venue, the first panel I caught was about using blockchains to build ‚Äúpublic goods.‚Äù Another was titled ‚ÄúNavigating the Web3 Workforce as a BIPOC, Queer, Marginalized Individual.‚Äù (The overall crowd skewed heavily white and male.) Aesthetically, ETHDenver embraced a spirit of collaborative, LARPish make-believe; there was quite a bit of talk about the Bufficorn, the cartoon buffalo-unicorn hybrid that was the event‚Äôs NFT mascot. (It fuses the magic of the unicorn with the strength of the buffalo.) People communicated with all manner of cheerful memes:gm, for ‚Äúgood morning,‚Äù was the universal greeting, regardless of the time of day;wagmimeant ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all gonna make it.‚Äù The Bufficorn, ETHDenver's mascot, and Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum. During the opening ceremony, the conference organizers emphasized Web3‚Äôs idealism. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about money,‚Äù said John Paller, founder of ETHDenver. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care about that.‚Äù The theme of the conference, he explained, was ‚ÄúBUIDLing.‚Äù The term, which everyone pronounced ‚Äúbiddling,‚Äù is a riff on the crypto meme ‚ÄúHODLing‚Äù‚Äîholding one‚Äôs assets no matter how grim the market looks, as an expression of faith in its long-term value. (In crypto, as in all internet culture, typos are a rich source of memes.) ‚ÄúBUIDL is the rally cry of the Bufficorn,‚Äù Paller said. What exactly were they BUIDLing? It‚Äôs easy to find brilliant, idealistic, experienced technology experts who think Web3 is pure nonsense. But it‚Äôs almost as easy to find ones who think it‚Äôs the real deal‚Äîhumanity‚Äôs best chance of redeeming the entire promise of the internet. On day two, the toilets broke;\\xa0the venue‚Äôs plumbing wasn‚Äôt ready for so\\xa0many people. Ethereum has a similar problem. One way tothink about Web3 is right there in the name: It‚Äôs the successor to Web 2.0, the era that was supposed to democratize the internet but instead became dominated by a handful of huge platforms, like Google and Facebook. Web3 is aboutre-decentralizing the web. From its Darpa-funded infancy, the internet was designed to be decentralized. This had a very practical Cold War‚Äìera purpose: A network of computers spread around the country couldn‚Äôt be wiped out in a single nuclear blast. Early enthusiasts also saw in this distributed structure an inherently liberating tendency, a spirit captured in John Gilmore‚Äôs famous 1993 dictum, ‚ÄúThe Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.‚Äù As the 1990s wore on, however, the dream of decentralization frayed. During what would later be dubbed the Web 1.0 era, the typical internet user, though theoretically empowered to create web pages, was in practice doing little more than viewing those made by others. And as a mature economy developed around the internet, powerful companies began to centralize on top of its open protocols‚Äîlike Microsoft using its operating system monopoly to take over the browser market with Internet Explorer. Then came the dotcom crash, which called into question whether the internet would ever fulfill its potential. Hope reemerged in the mid-2000s, when new platforms and technologies allowed ordinary users to create and upload content that could reach thousands or even millions of people. If Web 1.0 saw the masses passively consuming media created by publishers, in Web 2.0, the masses would be the creators: Wikipedia entries, Amazon product reviews, blog posts, YouTube videos, crowdfunding campaigns.Timecaptured the spirit of the moment with its 2006 Person of the Year selection: ‚ÄúYou.‚Äù But something very different was happening beneath the surface. User-\\xadgenerated content was free labor, and the platforms were the bosses. The big winners slurped up user data and used it, along with old-\\xadfashioned mergers and acquisitions, to build competitive moats around their businesses. Today, one company, Meta, owns three of the four largest social apps in the world, in terms of users. The fourth, YouTube, is owned by \\xadGoogle, which also accounts for around 90 percent of all internet searches. As these companies conquered more and more of the web, it became clear that the user was less a creative partner than a source of raw material to be perpetually harvested. Escape is difficult. Meta controls access to your Facebook and Instagram photos, plus your friend lists. Want to ditch Twitter or find a streaming alternative to YouTube? You can‚Äôt take your followers with you. And if a platform chooses to suspend or cancel your account, you have little recourse. In hindsight, there‚Äôs no shortage of explanations for why Web 2.0 failed to deliver on its early promise. Network effects. The unforeseen power of big data. Corporate greed. None of these have gone away. So why should we expect anything new from Web3? For believers, the answer is simple: Blockchain is different. Gavin Wood, an English computer scientist who helped program Ethereum, coined the term Web3 in 2014, the year Ethereum launched. (He first called it Web 3.0, but the decimal thing has since become pass√©.) In his view, Web 2.0‚Äôs fatal flaw wastrust. Everyone had to trust the biggest platforms not to abuse their power as they grew. Few seemed to notice that Google‚Äôs famous early motto, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be evil,‚Äù implied that being evil was an option. To Wood, Web3 is about building systems that don‚Äôt rely on trusting people, corporations, or governments to make moral choices, but that instead render evil choices impossible. Blockchain is the crucial technology for making that happen. Brewster Kahle, the creator of the Internet Archive and the Wayback Machine, has described this goal as ‚Äúlocking the web open.‚Äù Or, as Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz‚Äôs crypto fund and a leading Web3 booster, puts it, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be evil > don‚Äôt be evil.‚Äù A blockchain is a database that lives across a network of computers rather than on one server. No single person or organization owns it. Every computer, or node, stores a complete record of every transaction, so no one can control or destroy the network without first taking over a majority of the nodes. This makes it impossible for anyone to manipulate the database, say by giving themselves more tokens. Every change and transaction is logged on the chain, for all the world to see. There‚Äôs no central authority that must be trusted to enforce the rules.  So how exactly are blockchains supposed to lock the web open? Right now, platforms like Instagram and TikTok own the data that you generate while using them, store it on their servers, and make extracting it hard or impossible. In a Web3 world, the theory goes, your data would live on a blockchain, not a central server. Instead of platforms owning it,youwould, controlling access to it via a private cryptographic key that only you possess. If you got tired of one service, you could take your data to another. And a platform couldn‚Äôt change the rules of the game by erecting walls around its data, because it would never have owned the data in the first place. Innumerable Web3 startups are trying to apply this theory by creating blockchain-based alternatives to just about any platform you can name: Spotify, Twitter, Instagram, Google Docs. The liberal billionaire Frank McCourt has pledged $25 million toward developing a protocol for putting your social graph‚Äîthe interlocking map of relationships that you‚Äôve built up over the years but that is probably owned by Facebook‚Äîon the blockchain. A company called Sapien purports to be building an entire Web3 metaverse. Faith in blockchain infrastructure as a forcing mechanism for decentralization is Web3‚Äôs first tenet. There are other tenets‚Äîbut we‚Äôll get to those later. Because the infrastructure is making some ominous creaking noises already. On day twoof ETHDenver, the toilets broke. The plumbing at the Sports Castle wasn‚Äôt ready for so many people. Ethereum has a similar problem. Like the Sports Castle, it can‚Äôt handle the load of transactions going through its pipes. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, operates on a system known as ‚Äúproof of work.‚Äù Computers in the network ‚Äúmine‚Äù new tokens by being the first to solve complex math problems and get paid a fluctuating ‚Äúgas fee‚Äù for verifying transactions on the blockchain. The more demand on the network, the higher the gas fee. Ethereum has grown so popular that gas fees are often prohibitively high. During its wild surge late last year, they topped $55 per transaction. The math problems also requirea ton of electricity. By one estimate, if the world‚Äôs countries were ranked by energy consumption, the combined nation of Bitcoin and Ethereum would slot in between Italy and the United Kingdom. While many Bitcoiners shrug at this, Web3 proponents are torn up at the thought of contributing to the climate crisis. It seemed like every third person at ETHDenver was working on some kind of fix for these issues. Ethereum‚Äôs core developers have long been trying to execute a shift to ‚Äúproof of stake,‚Äù a more eco-friendly (but possibly less secure) alternative to proof of work, that after years of delay is supposed to launch this year. There are also competing blockchains that don‚Äôt use proof of work and thus don‚Äôt incur the environmental costs or gas fees of Ethereum. Then there are ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù blockchains that do most of the work on their own network before logging the results on Ethereum in big batches to lower the cost per transaction. Beyond the bandwidth problems, there was broad agreement among the ETHDenver crowd that the technology is far too difficult to use. Doing anything in Web3 is unbelievably confusing. I needed help just to redeem my crypto lunch tokens when I checked in at the hotel. If you want to get anything done and aren‚Äôt a programmer, you end up just clicking ‚ÄúOK‚Äù on a bunch of prompts that you don‚Äôt understand. This is a great way to get ripped off. During the conference, word got around that a phishing attack was hittingOpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace. In the end, almost $2 million worth of NFTs would be stolen. So common are these episodes that the news hardly raised eyebrows. Crypto‚Äôs user-unfriendliness puts tremendous pressure on the whole ecosystem to do the one thing it was designed not to do: centralize. In January, Moxie Marlinspike, a cryptographer and creator of the open source encrypted messaging app Signal, wrotean incisive takedownof Web3‚Äôs under\\xadlying premises on his personal blog. In it, Marlinspike argues that because most people crave convenience, centralized services always end up imposing themselves on top of decentralized technologies. In the early days of Web 1.0, some people thought ‚Äúwe‚Äôd all have our own web server with our own website, our own mail server for our own email,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúHowever‚Äîand I don‚Äôt think this can be emphasized enough‚Äîthat is not what people want. People do not want to run their own servers.‚Äù This pattern, Marlinspike points out, is already repeating itself in Web3. It‚Äôs quite cumbersome, if not impossible, for an app on your phone to interact directly with a blockchain. So almost all Web3 apps rely on one of two companies, Infura and Alchemy, to do that. Likewise the digital wallets that most people use to store their crypto assets. In other words, nearly every Web3 product relies on a middleman to say what‚Äôs happening on the blockchain. That‚Äôs a whole lot of trust for a system designed to make trust obsolete. The situation is even more centralized than Marlinspike lets on, because one company, ConsenSys, owns both Infura and the most popular wallet, MetaMask. Yes, your data lives indelibly somewhere on the blockchain, but in practice, any Web3 app you might use probably relies on these centralized services to access it. As an illustration, Marlinspike writes that when a satirical NFT he created got pulled from OpenSea, it also stopped appearing in his MetaMask wallet, even though it still existed on the blockchain. Marlinspike notes that Web3 defenders tend to reply to critiques by insisting, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs early days still.‚Äù It took exactly one day for Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, to prove his point. In a response to Marlinspike that he posted on Reddit, Buterin wrote that many of Marlinspike‚Äôs points ‚Äústrike me as having a correct criticism of thecurrent stateof the ecosystem, but they are missing where the blockchain ecosystem is going.‚Äù A small faction within the Web3 fold argues that blockchain is getting more attention than it deserves‚Äîa medium that has come to stand in the way of the true message, which is decentralization. ‚ÄúI would very strongly say, Web3 is not synonymous with blockchains,‚Äù says Jeromy Johnson, an engineer at Protocol Labs, a Web3 R&D organization. Johnson works on blockchain projects, but he also helped code the Inter\\xadPlanetary File System, a peer-to-peer alternative to the hypertext transfer protocol (that ‚Äúhttp://‚Äù bit at the front of every web address). Using IPFS prevents content from disappearing from the web just because a certain URL expires or changes. It‚Äôs a leading example of decentralized tech that isn‚Äôt blockchain. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of things that people try to use blockchain for that you don‚Äôt actually need a blockchain for,‚Äù Johnson says. ‚ÄúPeople try to build social networks on blockchains, and they put every tweet, or whatever they call it, and every ‚Äòlike‚Äô on the blockchain, and it‚Äôs like, What are you doing? That‚Äôs so dumb!‚Äù Johnson worries that blockchain has become a fetish. But I came to Denver wondering whether the same could be said of decentralization itself, as Web3 people understood it. Because the biggest barriers to decentralizing power may not be technological at all. Crypto‚Äôs user-unfriendliness keeps pushing the system to\\xa0do the one thing it was designed not to do:\\xa0centralize. Centralization is avague term. One of cryptocurrency‚Äôs original aims was to remove intermediaries‚Äîbanks‚Äîfrom financial transactions. (Hence its appeal among a certain set of libertarians, criminals, and lately Russian oligarchs.) That‚Äôs one way to think about centralization: A bank sits at the center of a transaction between two or more entities. But centralization and decentralization can also be framed as a matter of choice: How many options do you have? Is there just one player in the market, or can you shop around? By that standard, the banking industry is pretty decentralized. There are thousands of banks operating in the US alone. A decentralized technology does not guarantee a decentralized market. Take email. Email is a decentralized protocol. Anybody can, in theory, set up their own email server, but very few people do, as Marlinspike pointed out. Instead, people use email clients, and the market has centralized heavily around a handful of providers, especially Gmail. Even if you personally opt out of Gmail, the person on the other end of every second email you send probably uses it, meaning a copy of your email lives on Google‚Äôs servers whether you want it to or not. Centralizationis one word for this;consolidationis a better one. Consolidation is a feature not of technology but of markets. There is a much older protocol for dealing with consolidated markets than Web3. It‚Äôs called antitrust law. But government policy does not really figure into the Web3 blueprint. On the morning the toilets broke, I moderated a panel titled ‚ÄúWhy Decentralization Matters.‚Äù At one point, one of the panelists, Nick Dodson, an engineer at Fuel Labs, observed that ‚Äútraditional fintech‚Äù‚Äîpersonal finance apps that don‚Äôt use blockchains or crypto‚Äîis arguably more decentralized than Web3 ‚Äúbecause, to be honest, there‚Äôs more companies doing things.‚Äù Did you know, I asked, that the fintech sector owes much of its existence to a piece of federal legislation? The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis, has a section requiring US banks to let customers access their account data in a format that can be read by computer applications. You can thank that provision for the ability to sync up your data with personal finance apps like Betterment and Mint. On the back of this observation, I turned to one of the other panelists, Frankie Pangilinan, an accomplished blockchain programmer. Given the daunting technical challenges facing Web3, I asked, wouldn‚Äôt a simpler path to decentralization be for Congress to pass laws mandating data portability and interoperability? Wouldn‚Äôt that be easier than trying to iron out the kinks in all this complicated, unwieldy tech? ‚ÄúOh my God, what‚Äîcould you just re-ask that question? I‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù Pangilinan said, with the half-smile of someone unsure whether their leg is being pulled. I repeated myself. Wouldn‚Äôt a data portability law be easier than the whole Web3 thing? ‚ÄúGovernment moveswayslower than software does,‚Äù she said, with an incredulous laugh. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre an archaic system that we‚Äôre replacing, essentially.‚Äù Pangilinan was channeling the dominant view within the Web3 movement. Her skepticism is understandable. The internet economy arose during a period of deregulation and historically lax antitrust enforcement. The US government, in particular, has yet to prove itself capable of passing a significant law regulating Silicon Valley or winning a major lawsuit against a platform giant. Congress is, objectively speaking, an archaic system. And yet law, with all its faults, is still pretty much the most effective technology ever devised for preventing people and corporations from abusing their power‚Äîand forcing them to share it. Even within the tech sector, there‚Äôs a robust history of government intervention spurring innovation and user choice. Sometimes this comes through dramatic legal confrontations. In the 1950s, antitrust pressure from the federal government forced AT&T and its Bell Labs subsidiary to license out thousands of patents, including one for a little thing called the transistor. Other times, the role of government in decentralizing markets is practically invisible. It‚Äôs thanks to a little-known Federal Communications Commission regulation, for example, that Americans get to keep their cell phone numbers when they switch carriers. But even members of the progressive Web3 community have essentially zero interest in directing their formidable resources toward influencing public policy. They tend to think, instead, as Pangilinan put it, that government is the problem being designed around: just another institution, like Google or Facebook, that demands our trust without earning it. Later on, I chatted backstage with the third panelist, a former Ethereum core developer named Lane Rettig. He was frank about the shortcomings of crypto and Web3. But he strongly agreed with Pangilinan about the futility of government regulation. Rettig is working on a blockchain called Spacemesh. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which require tremendous computing power to mine, anyone can mine Spacemesh tokens using spare processing power on their laptop or smartphone, just by downloading an ordinary-looking app‚Äîmeaning the network could be distributed among millions of participants, rather than the tens of thousands of people who run Bitcoin or Ethereum nodes. That sounded interesting, so I pulled out my iPhone. Could I download it right then? No, Rettig said; unfortunately, Space\\xadmesh wasn‚Äôt available on phones yet. The mobile app hadn‚Äôt been built, but even if it had, Apple blocks most crypto-related apps from its App Store. In a call-back to my ‚Äúregulation is good‚Äù routine, I joked that the Open App Markets Act‚Äîa bill that has bipartisan momentum in Congress and would force Apple to permit downloading apps not offered in its App Store‚Äîwould help with that. Rettig‚Äôs eyes lit up. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bill?‚Äù he said excitedly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs huge. I can see that having big implications.‚Äù It‚Äôs not quiteright to say that crypto people are wholly uninterested in regulation. According to a recent report, the amount spent on crypto lobbying has quadrupled since 2018. But this effort isn‚Äôt aimed at using regulation to achieve the goals of decentralized markets or data portability. It‚Äôs mostly aboutblockingnew regulations that might stop the gravy train, making sure the state stays out of crypto‚Äôs way. That gravy train has a name: DeFi. Short for ‚Äúdecentralized finance,‚Äù DeFi is essentially a crypto betting market, with financial products that allow investors to gamble on cryptocurrencies via options, derivatives, and other avenues. A common one is ‚Äúyield farming,‚Äù which in essence means lending out your crypto in exchange for interest payments. DeFi is big business. The ETHDenver conference may have been a pageant of high-minded ideals, but it was overwhelmingly underwritten by DeFi companies. At any given moment, almost all the most popular Ethereum apps are some form of DeFi platform or exchange. Unlike in traditional finance, these are largely unregulated. If someone steals your money, the bank doesn‚Äôt have to pay you back‚Äîbecause there is no bank. This is far from an idle concern. One analysis found that more than $10 billion was stolen from DeFi platforms in 2021 alone. On my first night in Denver, I headed to a happy hour sponsored by Uma, which bills itself as ‚Äúa fast, flexible, and secure way to create decentralized financial products.‚Äù The event was crawling with DeFi people, each of whom assured me that their product promised super-high yields with minimal risk. Arisa Toyosaki, a former investment banker, told me about the startup she was launching, called Cega. With Cega, she explained, crypto holders will be able to invest in exotic crypto derivatives and generate healthy returns. And, she assured me, it will be nearly impossible to lose money unless the market drops more than 50\\xa0percent. How is this possible? ‚ÄúI used to do this at investment banks,‚Äù Toyosaki said. The DeFi derivative market, she said, ‚Äúexploded in the back half of 2021.‚Äù For the first time, there are enough crypto products to slice and dice into derivatives. To do that well, Toyosaki explained, you need a team of quants who can build advanced statistical models of markets. This was evidently meant to be reassuring. Just in case the parallels to the eve of the 2008 financial crisis were too subtle, my next stop was a performance by the Dutch DJ Ti√´sto that was hosted by Bacon Coin, a startup that offersmortgage-backed crypto tokens. Even as DeFi dominated the sponsorships and party calendar, many of the Web3 true believers viewed it with disdain. The rows of tables where crypto companies pitched their wares was labeled the ‚ÄúShill Zone‚Äù on the official conference map. As I was leaving a coffee shop one day, I overheard two guys sitting at a table outside. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not into DeFi,‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said the other, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not a Ponzinomics person?‚Äù Vitalik Buterin was at the next table, by the looks of it gamely letting someone shill their business to him. Even Buterin publicly worries about the cash grab taking place in the Ethereum universe he created. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt exercise our voice, the only things that get built are the things that are immediately profitable,‚Äù he recently toldTime. ‚ÄúAnd those are often far from what‚Äôs actually the best for the world.‚Äù But there‚Äôs a paradox. As much as Web3‚Äôs dreamers might shun the crypto casino, the fact remains that cryptocurrency‚Äîmoney‚Äîis the driving force of what they‚Äôre trying to build. This is where all the game theory comes in, along with the other, higher tenets of Web3. It‚Äôs\\xa0also where the Web3 movement breaks with the economic innocence of past waves of internet utopianism. In case the\\xa0parallels to the eve of the 2008 financial crisis\\xa0were too subtle,\\xa0my next stop was a startup that offers mortgage-backed crypto tokens. Back in theearly days of Web 2.0, the open source movement‚Äîthat era‚Äôs generation of idealists‚Äîwas guided by a perhaps naive belief in the willingness of people to volunteer their energies and talents for the greater good. Linux die-hards believed software should be free, recoiling at the profit motive. The platforms born in this era played to that spirit, deploying lofty rhetoric about making the world a better, more open, more connected place‚Äîwhile, in the background, quietly setting up global surveillance operations to spy on their users for the benefit of advertisers. ‚ÄúA lot of open-web, open source people always thought that money was dirty,‚Äù says Julien Genestoux, a veteran of the open source movement who created Unlock Protocol, which seeks to put memberships and subscriptions on the blockchain. ‚ÄúOne of the things crypto has been doing is putting money front and center,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBy doing this, it removes the ability of corporate actors to capture the value from everybody else without us knowing. By making it explicit, a thing we‚Äôre all staring at, we‚Äôre making it harder for the people who want to take it from everybody else.‚Äù At the most basic level, Web3‚Äôs approach to financial incentives is an ingenious way of solving new technology‚Äôs adoption problem. Let‚Äôs say you make a new decentralized platform built on the blockchain, one that works so smoothly that people can use it without getting a PhD in cryptography. Users control their own data and everything is open source. The thing is, those ordinary users probably don‚Äôt care much about data ownership or immutable public ledgers. They care about convenience and fun and being where their friends are. So how do you get anyone to use your new Web3 app? The answer is tokenomics. The business model of nearly every proposed Web3 platform entails distributing tokens to everyone involved, thus incentivizing them to use and improve the platform to make the value of those tokens go up. In Web3-speak, this is called ‚Äúaligning the incentives.‚Äù The concept has its roots in Bitcoin, whose pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, devised a set of rules to prevent conflict between an individual‚Äôs self-interest and the interests of Bitcoin. Using game theory principles, Bitcoin could incentivize everyone to act for the collective good. Even if someone took control of enough of the network to be able to rewrite its history and inflate their account, they would have a powerful reason not to: Such treachery would kill confidence in Bitcoin and thus crater the value of their own holdings. Many people see Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as pyramid schemes, since their value is a pure function of there being someone else who wants to buy in. But tokenomics can, at least theoretically, serve a useful purpose out in the real world. Take Presearch, a Web3 search engine. Presearch is distributed across a network of nodes that anyone can set up on their computer or a virtual private server. Your search term gets passed to one of the nodes, which queries a range of sources before returning a response. People who run nodes are rewarded in the form of PRE tokens, Presearch‚Äôs custom crypto coin. Users can also be rewarded with tiny micropayments of the token for performing searches. As the platform gets more popular, the tokens should become more valuable. That value has a real-world reference point: Advertisers have to buy tokens in order to appear above search results. Will this work? Perhaps not. But it‚Äôs not a Ponzi scheme. Web3 apps promise not just to pay users but to give them a say in how the platforms are run. In the case of Presearch, for example, the PRE token will confer ownership and some kind of governance power over the platform. In theory, that distributed structure should prevent anyone from pushing Presearch in any shady or exploitative directions. ‚ÄúWhy are we not going to end up like Google?‚Äù says Presearch‚Äôs founder, Colin Pape, referring to the search giant‚Äôs well documented privacy issues. ‚ÄúBecause we have everyone aligned around this one value unit, and if we try to extract too much value from users, and they get pissed off, the value of the token goes down.‚Äù That sounds plausible in the abstract, but it raises all sorts of practical questions. How do you keep someone from buying enough tokens to exert unilateral control? How do you know the crypto accounts holding tokens belong to separate human beings? If you do manage to keep things decentralized, how will you act quickly enough to compete with traditional businesses that don‚Äôt have to put every single decision to a vote? The answers are all speculative, because none of that governance stuff actually exists yet. Pape admits that decentralized control remains an aspiration for Presearch. The reality is that the company, meaning Pape, controls the search engine, just like Alphabet controls Google. This is something of a theme in the Web3 world. Everyone has a white paper spelling out how their new platform will be governed by ‚Äúthe community‚Äù ‚Ä¶ eventually, ultimately, at some future point yet to be determined, once a whole bunch of other issues are sorted out and the platform gets big enough to remove the training wheels.Oh Lord, give me decentralized control, but not yet. If the vision of collectively run mega-platforms sounds implausibly far out, the highest tenets of Web3 are somehow even more ambitious. Using blockchain technology and tokenomics to get people to buy into a set of decentralized apps? That‚Äôs just the beginning. For some Web3 luminaries, the real goal is to use cryptocurrencies to lock human beings into a more cooperative, less self-destructive society. I didn‚Äôt fully understand this until I met Kevin Owocki. Few people aretrying harder to turn the idealism of Web3 into reality than Owocki. A resident of Boulder County, near Denver, Owocki is the founder of GitCoin, a platform for funding open source Web3 projects that has raised and distributed roughly $60 million so far. He was one of the most Colorado of the many Colorado guys on hand at ETHDenver, with long hair past his shoulders, a trim beard, and an athletic build. At one point, when I said I was thirsty, he pulled a can of kombucha out of his back pocket and handed it to me. Owocki was something of a rock star at the conference. He is credited with coining the term BUIDL in 2017. Admirers approached him nonstop to talk, express their support, or ask for a copy of his book,GreenPilled: How Crypto Can Regenerate the World, which was the talk of the conference and quickly sold out of the 400 copies he had ordered. Owocki is about as far from a casino person as you‚Äôll find in the crypto world. In one of several presentations he gave, Owocki told the crowd that since research shows money stops increasing happiness after about $100,000 in annual income, Web3 founders should maximize their happiness by giving their excess money to public goods that everyone gets to enjoy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs cypherpunk, which is all about privacy, decentralization: hardcore libertarian shit,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more of a leftist. I‚Äôm more solarpunk, which is, how do we solve our contemporary problems around sustainability and equitable economic systems? It‚Äôs a different set of values.‚Äù The internet, he explained, made it possible to move information between computers. This revolutionized communication. Blockchains have made it possible to move units of value between computers. Owocki believes this can be harnessed to revolutionize how human beings interact through something he calls ‚Äúregenerative cryptoeconomics.‚Äù Crypto\\xadeconomics, he writes inGreenPilled, ‚Äúis the use of blockchain-based incentives to design new kinds of systems, applications, or networks.‚ÄùRegenerativecryptoeconomics means doing this in a way that makes the world a better place for everyone. The goal is to break free from the zero-sum, rich-get-richer patterns of capitalism. Owocki believes that the right cryptoeconomic structure can help solve collective action problems like climate change, misinformation, and an underfunded digital infrastructure. The key tool for achieving this is adecentralized autonomous organization. In theory, a DAO (yes, pronounced the same as the ancient Chinese word for the way of the universe) uses crypto\\xadcurrency to boost collective action. Typically, members join by buying some amount of a custom token issued by the DAO. That entitles them to an ownership stake in the DAO itself. Member-owners vote on what the DAO does‚Äîwhich is mostly to say, what it spends money on, since a blockchain-based entity can do little besides move funds from one address to another. The young concept already has a checkered history. The first DAO, named simply ‚ÄúThe DAO,‚Äù collapsed in 2016 after someone exploited a loophole in its code to siphon off what was then worth some $50 million in Ethereum currency. Similarly colorful failures have followed. DAOs were nonetheless all the rage at ETHDenver, where attendees waxed on about their world-changing potential. Kimbal Musk, Elon‚Äôs photogenic brother, spoke about his Big Green DAO, a food-related charity. Giving away money via a DAO, he insisted, got rid of all the painful bureaucracy of philanthropic nonprofits. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs way better,‚Äù he said, though he also granted that ‚Äúthere are many ways to fail, and this one could fail spectacularly.‚Äù What is it about a DAO that‚Äîunlike, say, a Kickstarter page‚Äîfrees humanity from the collective action problems that threaten to doom the species? According to Owocki, it‚Äôs the ability to write code in ways that tinker with incentive structures. (In this sense, the first DAO was arguably Bitcoin itself.) ‚ÄúOur weapon of choice is novel mechanism designs, based upon sound game theory, deployed to decentralized blockchain networks as transparent open source code,‚Äù he writes inGreenPilled.Indeed, the book has very little to say about technology, per se, and much more to say about various game theory concepts. These range from the sort of thing you‚Äôd learn in an undergrad econ class‚Äî‚Äúpublic goods are non-\\xadexcludable and non-rivalrous‚Äù‚Äîto things that wouldn‚Äôt be out of place in a sci-fi novel: ‚Äúcommunity inclusion currencies,‚Äù ‚Äúfractal DAO protocols,‚Äù ‚Äúretroactive public goods funding.‚Äù It‚Äôs hard enough for me to grasp how a DAO works. So while I‚Äôm in Denver,\\xa0I create one. One of the most powerful incentive design techniques, according to Owocki, is something called quadratic voting. Standing near the edge of the Shill Zone, Owocki turned around to show me the back of his purple baseball jacket, which said ‚ÄúQuadratic Lands.‚Äù The Quadratic Lands, Owocki explained, are a mythical place where the laws of economics have been redesigned to produce public goods. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a meme,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to tell you it already exists.‚Äù (Everyone at ETHDenver was concerned, rightly, about my ability to separate metaphorical claims from literal ones.) In a quadratic voting system, you get a budget to allocate among various options. Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs dollars, though it could be any unit. The more dollars you allocate to a particular choice, the more your vote for it counts. But there‚Äôs an important caveat: Each marginal dollar you pledge to the same choice is worth less than the previous one. (Technically, the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of your vote rises quadratically, rather than linearly.) This makes it harder for the richest people in a group to dominate the vote. GitCoin uses an adaptation, quadratic funding, to award money to Web3 projects. The number of people who contribute to a given project counts more than the amount they contribute. This rewards ideas supported by the most people rather than the wealthiest: regenerative cryptonomics in action. Glen Weyl, the polymathic Microsoft researcher who came up with quadratic voting, is far more cautious than Owocki about its applicability to blockchain. In a foreword to Owocki‚Äôs book, he writes, ‚ÄúI am deeply ambivalent about Web3.‚Äù He has positioned himself as a sort of insider critic of the movement, one who supports its broad goals of decentralization and digital public goods but questions its faith in the potential of blockchains and cryptocurrencies in their current state. Weyl walked me through the weaknesses of using quadratic voting in a DAO. A major problem is Sybil attacks, in which one person creates a thousand ‚Äúsock puppet‚Äù accounts and uses them to take over the voting. Even if you come up with a solution to the proof-of-\\xadidentity problem so that it‚Äôs hard to make duplicate accounts, someone could just get people in the analog world to create accounts on their behalf. Imagine, Weyl said, if the Chinese government wanted to take over a DAO. All it would have to do is instruct its citizens to join and hand over control of their wallets. Owocki believes he and his co-revolutionaries can sort out these problems. He asked if I‚Äôd heard of the Matthew Effect, which, he explained, is how economists refer to the fact that the rich tend to get richer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fundamental law of economics,‚Äù he said, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs unbeatable. Conquering laws of nature is what technology is for. ‚ÄúAn airplane upends gravity; what if you can build an economic system that upends the Matthew Effect? Dude, quadratic voting is it.‚Äù All of thisis getting a little heady for me. Never mind the furthest reaches of Owocki‚Äôs theory; it‚Äôs hard enough for me to grasp how a DAO is supposed to work. So while I‚Äôm in Denver, I decide tocreate one. My friend Jacks√≥n Smith works for a nonprofit called Learning Economy Foundation that researches the use of blockchain in education. He‚Äôs at the conference and agrees to help me create the DAO. We settle on an admittedly low-stakes idea: Our DAO will try to winThe New Yorkermagazine‚Äôs weekly cartoon caption contest, in which readers compete to supply the wittiest punch line to a captionless cartoon. Each week, the DAO members will vote on each other‚Äôs submissions and submit the internal winner to the actual contest. We call it lmaoDAO. I put in serious hours on the DAO over the weekend, but not as many as Jacks√≥n and a couple of his coworkers, who actually know how to program and generously volunteer time to build it, and whom I half-jokingly start referring to as ‚Äúmy core devs.‚Äù I should say, to BUIDL it. We‚Äôre BUIDLers, officially hacking together a Web3 application in the spirit of ETHDenver. I am somewhat surprised to find that, when I explain what I‚Äôm doing, people at the conference are unfailingly supportive. I thought they might take exception to a journalist creating a DAO as a stunt, an act of mild trolling, but the general sense is that we‚Äôve come up with a clever idea. Web3 is a realm where coders can feel good again about working in tech. Two things becomevery clear as we create the DAO. First, a DAO is nothing more than a group whose membership requires owning a crypto token‚Äîin our case, a custom LMAO coin that we mint out of thin air. Like most DAOs, ours is organized on Discord, a Web 2.0 application. Our DAO isn‚Äôt really decentralized; we control the Discord, Jacks√≥n controls the voting website, and I manually submit the captions to NewYorker.com. We've committed in principle to building out decentralized governance, but who knows when that will happen. In the meantime, everyone else has to trust that we‚Äôre doing what we say we are. The second thing that becomes clear is that BUIDLing is really fun. Setting up a DAO is a bit like designing a video game. You have to create incentives and rules that will keep people playing and can‚Äôt be easily exploited. In fact, it feels like a game within a game, because Web3 itself is not unlike an immersive RPG‚Äîan alternate reality with its own rules, customs, and language. Play for long enough and you stop having to check the instructions. All kinds of esoteric jargon starts making sense.Switch your wallet from the Ethereum mainnet to the Gnosis chain to claim your LMAO tokens. Sync your tokens with the \\xadcollab.land Discord bot to prove you‚Äôre a member and get access to the locked Discord channels. The real fun of BUIDLing lies in the problem-solving. How will we get people to join, for example? Nathan, one of my devs, comes up with an idea: He can scrape every crypto wallet that holds either a Bufficorn NFT or ETHDenver meal tokens, and use that as a proxy for people who attended the conference. Then we can ‚Äúairdrop‚Äù our custom token to everyone on that list. Most intoxicatingly, this all takes place in a relatively closed system. Very few of these decisions require us to think much about the messy world outside the confines of our DAO. It all helps me understand the draw of Web3. The sense of moral valor that once accompanied working in Web 2.0 is harder to find these days. Whatever else Web3 is, it‚Äôs a realm where coders and technologists can reconnect with the joy of hacking, where they can feel good again about working in tech. Jacks√≥n, who in fact builds elaborate board games as a hobby, tells me that escapism is part of Web3‚Äôs appeal. The question is whether the escape hatch leads to a real place or a fantasyland. As those pizza crusts and empty snack bags pile up, I realize that it‚Äôs Saturday evening, and dinnertime is approaching. There‚Äôs a rumor that Snoop Dogg, who recently announced his intention to turn Death Row Records into an NFT music label, is throwing a party somewhere. But I have plans to meet up with my childhood friend Dave, who lives in Denver. As Dave and I catch up over tacos and margaritas, I feel slightly crazed, struggling to explain what I‚Äôve been up to: Web3, cryptoeconomics, BUIDLing a DAO. I‚Äôm a bit like Dorothy returned from Oz. Gradually, talk drifts to normal stuff: his family, my job, a trip we‚Äôve been planning. That night, I sleep in Dave‚Äôs basement, and on Sunday morning I‚Äôm woken early by the patter of his 2-year-old daughter‚Äôs feet. The guys at the conference seem to really believe they‚Äôre building a better world for her, but in the morning light it‚Äôs hard to take seriously the idea that her future depends on precisely calibrating a bunch of incentives in a blockchain membership organization. It all feels like a game that I‚Äôve unplugged from. Then my phone buzzes. My services are needed before the DAO can officially launch. Without thinking much of it, I plug myself back in.

With a strong concurrency model, these languages seem underutilized for things like real-time apps, messaging, or even blockchain. \\n\\nAnd I also stumbled upon a hackathon recently that‚Äôs pushing these boundaries‚Äîsuper curious to see how these less popular stacks perform. Thoughts?\\n\\nComment 0: I've seen Java, JavaScript, Python, GoLang, Rust, and Kotlin mostly.\\nComment 1: As for the smart contract code, you're more likely to be using Solidity than any of the above.\\n\\nSolidity is fine and works very well with smart contract logic, although it's very limited. At some point you'll end up doing pointer arithmetic to manipulate strings or something like that. Sometimes it feels like writing in C without libraries -- and the 24.5kb contract size limit will make sure you use very few libs!\\n\\nFor the frontend, I did my last project in Dart (Flutter). Dart is super nice to use, it feels a lot like Typescript, but it's compiled, not interpreted. It's a lot more ergonomic than Rust, at the cost of having a garbage collector. I'd consider Dart for a Web2 backend, if the possibility of memory leaks isn't a major concern for the project.\\nComment 2: I don‚Äôt get why not using python and js.\\nWorks great, having lot of dev using it so easier to search when you have a problem.\\nI don‚Äôt see a point going into using less common language\\nComment 3: I started studying the Elixir / Phoenix platform this year because it was recommended by the lead dev of my favorite blockchain for these reasons.

It's getting lateon a Saturday afternoon in Denver when I lean back and take in the full weirdness of what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm seated at a long plastic folding table against the wall in a windowless room, a Discord server open on my laptop. Pizza crusts and empty potato chip bags are piled up around me, evidence of the feverish hours I‚Äôve spent hacking together a project with a trio ofblockchaindevelopers. I‚Äôm not a programmer, just a journalist with a law degree. Yet somehow I‚Äôve gotten swept up in creating my own DAO‚Äîa decentralized autonomous organization, a favorite concept among the starry-eyed proponents ofWeb3‚Äîand it‚Äôs supposed to launch tomorrow. No doubt you have questions. So do I. Like: What happened to me? Three days ago I was a crypto skeptic who could barely figure out how to buy ether. Now I‚Äôm speaking in complete sentences about multisig treasuries and quadratic voting. The devs have almost integrated our site with non-MetaMask wallets, and I‚Äôve just dropped $85 for a domain on the Ethereum Name Service despite having no clear use for it. And rather than feeling exasperated or baffled, I seem to have caught the same thrill, however fleetingly, as everyone around me. I am among the estimated 10,000 people who arrived in Colorado a few days ago for this year‚Äôs ETHDenver conference, the biggest and oldest event in the world ofEthereumand Web3. Most of these folks came here to be among their people. I came to try to understand them. And I think I finally do. The term Web3,as you may or may not have noticed, emerged from obscurity last year, buoyed by rising cryptocurrency prices and some canny marketing by venture capitalists. Its meaning is hard to pin down. In the media and on Twitter, Web3 has become a catchall for anything having to do with blockchains and cryptocurrency: People paying tens of thousands of dollars for digital collectibles known as non-fungible tokens, orNFTs, with neither practical nor aesthetic value, then flipping them for even ungodlier sums.‚ÄúPlay-to-earn‚Äù video gamesthat lure gamers into flimsy virtual worlds with the promise of riches. Celebrities shilling crypto exchanges during the Super Bowl. A ceaseless parade ofscams,hacks, andfrauds. But to a core of true believers, Web3 stands apart from the garish excesses and brazen misbehavior of the flashing-neon crypto casino. If cryptocurrency was originally about decentralizing money, Web3 is about decentralizing ‚Ä¶ everything. Its mission is almost achingly idealistic: to free humanity not only from Big Tech domination but also from exploitative capitalism itself‚Äîand to do it purely through code. Bitcoin, the original blockchain-based cryptocurrency, created a way to send and receive digital money without needing a bank to approve those transactions. Instead of regulators and cops, a set of carefully designed incentives would, in theory, keep everyone acting in the best interests of all Bitcoin users. Web3 aims to apply these two concepts‚Äîdecentralization and game theory‚Äîto all of digital life. The main vehicle for this is Ethereum, a blockchain that borrowed Bitcoin‚Äôs key features and added a major innovation: It was designed with its own programming language so developers could build apps, and eventually a whole new decentralized digital infrastructure, to run on it. If Bitcoin attracts anarcho-capitalists who want to dethrone the central bankers, the culture around Ethereum and Web3 has a more progressive bent. After I walked into the Denver Sports Castle, a massive former sporting goods store turned events space that served as ETHDenver‚Äôs main venue, the first panel I caught was about using blockchains to build ‚Äúpublic goods.‚Äù Another was titled ‚ÄúNavigating the Web3 Workforce as a BIPOC, Queer, Marginalized Individual.‚Äù (The overall crowd skewed heavily white and male.) Aesthetically, ETHDenver embraced a spirit of collaborative, LARPish make-believe; there was quite a bit of talk about the Bufficorn, the cartoon buffalo-unicorn hybrid that was the event‚Äôs NFT mascot. (It fuses the magic of the unicorn with the strength of the buffalo.) People communicated with all manner of cheerful memes:gm, for ‚Äúgood morning,‚Äù was the universal greeting, regardless of the time of day;wagmimeant ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all gonna make it.‚Äù The Bufficorn, ETHDenver's mascot, and Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum. During the opening ceremony, the conference organizers emphasized Web3‚Äôs idealism. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about money,‚Äù said John Paller, founder of ETHDenver. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care about that.‚Äù The theme of the conference, he explained, was ‚ÄúBUIDLing.‚Äù The term, which everyone pronounced ‚Äúbiddling,‚Äù is a riff on the crypto meme ‚ÄúHODLing‚Äù‚Äîholding one‚Äôs assets no matter how grim the market looks, as an expression of faith in its long-term value. (In crypto, as in all internet culture, typos are a rich source of memes.) ‚ÄúBUIDL is the rally cry of the Bufficorn,‚Äù Paller said. What exactly were they BUIDLing? It‚Äôs easy to find brilliant, idealistic, experienced technology experts who think Web3 is pure nonsense. But it‚Äôs almost as easy to find ones who think it‚Äôs the real deal‚Äîhumanity‚Äôs best chance of redeeming the entire promise of the internet. On day two, the toilets broke;\\xa0the venue‚Äôs plumbing wasn‚Äôt ready for so\\xa0many people. Ethereum has a similar problem. One way tothink about Web3 is right there in the name: It‚Äôs the successor to Web 2.0, the era that was supposed to democratize the internet but instead became dominated by a handful of huge platforms, like Google and Facebook. Web3 is aboutre-decentralizing the web. From its Darpa-funded infancy, the internet was designed to be decentralized. This had a very practical Cold War‚Äìera purpose: A network of computers spread around the country couldn‚Äôt be wiped out in a single nuclear blast. Early enthusiasts also saw in this distributed structure an inherently liberating tendency, a spirit captured in John Gilmore‚Äôs famous 1993 dictum, ‚ÄúThe Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.‚Äù As the 1990s wore on, however, the dream of decentralization frayed. During what would later be dubbed the Web 1.0 era, the typical internet user, though theoretically empowered to create web pages, was in practice doing little more than viewing those made by others. And as a mature economy developed around the internet, powerful companies began to centralize on top of its open protocols‚Äîlike Microsoft using its operating system monopoly to take over the browser market with Internet Explorer. Then came the dotcom crash, which called into question whether the internet would ever fulfill its potential. Hope reemerged in the mid-2000s, when new platforms and technologies allowed ordinary users to create and upload content that could reach thousands or even millions of people. If Web 1.0 saw the masses passively consuming media created by publishers, in Web 2.0, the masses would be the creators: Wikipedia entries, Amazon product reviews, blog posts, YouTube videos, crowdfunding campaigns.Timecaptured the spirit of the moment with its 2006 Person of the Year selection: ‚ÄúYou.‚Äù But something very different was happening beneath the surface. User-\\xadgenerated content was free labor, and the platforms were the bosses. The big winners slurped up user data and used it, along with old-\\xadfashioned mergers and acquisitions, to build competitive moats around their businesses. Today, one company, Meta, owns three of the four largest social apps in the world, in terms of users. The fourth, YouTube, is owned by \\xadGoogle, which also accounts for around 90 percent of all internet searches. As these companies conquered more and more of the web, it became clear that the user was less a creative partner than a source of raw material to be perpetually harvested. Escape is difficult. Meta controls access to your Facebook and Instagram photos, plus your friend lists. Want to ditch Twitter or find a streaming alternative to YouTube? You can‚Äôt take your followers with you. And if a platform chooses to suspend or cancel your account, you have little recourse. In hindsight, there‚Äôs no shortage of explanations for why Web 2.0 failed to deliver on its early promise. Network effects. The unforeseen power of big data. Corporate greed. None of these have gone away. So why should we expect anything new from Web3? For believers, the answer is simple: Blockchain is different. Gavin Wood, an English computer scientist who helped program Ethereum, coined the term Web3 in 2014, the year Ethereum launched. (He first called it Web 3.0, but the decimal thing has since become pass√©.) In his view, Web 2.0‚Äôs fatal flaw wastrust. Everyone had to trust the biggest platforms not to abuse their power as they grew. Few seemed to notice that Google‚Äôs famous early motto, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be evil,‚Äù implied that being evil was an option. To Wood, Web3 is about building systems that don‚Äôt rely on trusting people, corporations, or governments to make moral choices, but that instead render evil choices impossible. Blockchain is the crucial technology for making that happen. Brewster Kahle, the creator of the Internet Archive and the Wayback Machine, has described this goal as ‚Äúlocking the web open.‚Äù Or, as Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz‚Äôs crypto fund and a leading Web3 booster, puts it, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be evil > don‚Äôt be evil.‚Äù A blockchain is a database that lives across a network of computers rather than on one server. No single person or organization owns it. Every computer, or node, stores a complete record of every transaction, so no one can control or destroy the network without first taking over a majority of the nodes. This makes it impossible for anyone to manipulate the database, say by giving themselves more tokens. Every change and transaction is logged on the chain, for all the world to see. There‚Äôs no central authority that must be trusted to enforce the rules.  So how exactly are blockchains supposed to lock the web open? Right now, platforms like Instagram and TikTok own the data that you generate while using them, store it on their servers, and make extracting it hard or impossible. In a Web3 world, the theory goes, your data would live on a blockchain, not a central server. Instead of platforms owning it,youwould, controlling access to it via a private cryptographic key that only you possess. If you got tired of one service, you could take your data to another. And a platform couldn‚Äôt change the rules of the game by erecting walls around its data, because it would never have owned the data in the first place. Innumerable Web3 startups are trying to apply this theory by creating blockchain-based alternatives to just about any platform you can name: Spotify, Twitter, Instagram, Google Docs. The liberal billionaire Frank McCourt has pledged $25 million toward developing a protocol for putting your social graph‚Äîthe interlocking map of relationships that you‚Äôve built up over the years but that is probably owned by Facebook‚Äîon the blockchain. A company called Sapien purports to be building an entire Web3 metaverse. Faith in blockchain infrastructure as a forcing mechanism for decentralization is Web3‚Äôs first tenet. There are other tenets‚Äîbut we‚Äôll get to those later. Because the infrastructure is making some ominous creaking noises already. On day twoof ETHDenver, the toilets broke. The plumbing at the Sports Castle wasn‚Äôt ready for so many people. Ethereum has a similar problem. Like the Sports Castle, it can‚Äôt handle the load of transactions going through its pipes. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, operates on a system known as ‚Äúproof of work.‚Äù Computers in the network ‚Äúmine‚Äù new tokens by being the first to solve complex math problems and get paid a fluctuating ‚Äúgas fee‚Äù for verifying transactions on the blockchain. The more demand on the network, the higher the gas fee. Ethereum has grown so popular that gas fees are often prohibitively high. During its wild surge late last year, they topped $55 per transaction. The math problems also requirea ton of electricity. By one estimate, if the world‚Äôs countries were ranked by energy consumption, the combined nation of Bitcoin and Ethereum would slot in between Italy and the United Kingdom. While many Bitcoiners shrug at this, Web3 proponents are torn up at the thought of contributing to the climate crisis. It seemed like every third person at ETHDenver was working on some kind of fix for these issues. Ethereum‚Äôs core developers have long been trying to execute a shift to ‚Äúproof of stake,‚Äù a more eco-friendly (but possibly less secure) alternative to proof of work, that after years of delay is supposed to launch this year. There are also competing blockchains that don‚Äôt use proof of work and thus don‚Äôt incur the environmental costs or gas fees of Ethereum. Then there are ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù blockchains that do most of the work on their own network before logging the results on Ethereum in big batches to lower the cost per transaction. Beyond the bandwidth problems, there was broad agreement among the ETHDenver crowd that the technology is far too difficult to use. Doing anything in Web3 is unbelievably confusing. I needed help just to redeem my crypto lunch tokens when I checked in at the hotel. If you want to get anything done and aren‚Äôt a programmer, you end up just clicking ‚ÄúOK‚Äù on a bunch of prompts that you don‚Äôt understand. This is a great way to get ripped off. During the conference, word got around that a phishing attack was hittingOpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace. In the end, almost $2 million worth of NFTs would be stolen. So common are these episodes that the news hardly raised eyebrows. Crypto‚Äôs user-unfriendliness puts tremendous pressure on the whole ecosystem to do the one thing it was designed not to do: centralize. In January, Moxie Marlinspike, a cryptographer and creator of the open source encrypted messaging app Signal, wrotean incisive takedownof Web3‚Äôs under\\xadlying premises on his personal blog. In it, Marlinspike argues that because most people crave convenience, centralized services always end up imposing themselves on top of decentralized technologies. In the early days of Web 1.0, some people thought ‚Äúwe‚Äôd all have our own web server with our own website, our own mail server for our own email,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúHowever‚Äîand I don‚Äôt think this can be emphasized enough‚Äîthat is not what people want. People do not want to run their own servers.‚Äù This pattern, Marlinspike points out, is already repeating itself in Web3. It‚Äôs quite cumbersome, if not impossible, for an app on your phone to interact directly with a blockchain. So almost all Web3 apps rely on one of two companies, Infura and Alchemy, to do that. Likewise the digital wallets that most people use to store their crypto assets. In other words, nearly every Web3 product relies on a middleman to say what‚Äôs happening on the blockchain. That‚Äôs a whole lot of trust for a system designed to make trust obsolete. The situation is even more centralized than Marlinspike lets on, because one company, ConsenSys, owns both Infura and the most popular wallet, MetaMask. Yes, your data lives indelibly somewhere on the blockchain, but in practice, any Web3 app you might use probably relies on these centralized services to access it. As an illustration, Marlinspike writes that when a satirical NFT he created got pulled from OpenSea, it also stopped appearing in his MetaMask wallet, even though it still existed on the blockchain. Marlinspike notes that Web3 defenders tend to reply to critiques by insisting, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs early days still.‚Äù It took exactly one day for Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, to prove his point. In a response to Marlinspike that he posted on Reddit, Buterin wrote that many of Marlinspike‚Äôs points ‚Äústrike me as having a correct criticism of thecurrent stateof the ecosystem, but they are missing where the blockchain ecosystem is going.‚Äù A small faction within the Web3 fold argues that blockchain is getting more attention than it deserves‚Äîa medium that has come to stand in the way of the true message, which is decentralization. ‚ÄúI would very strongly say, Web3 is not synonymous with blockchains,‚Äù says Jeromy Johnson, an engineer at Protocol Labs, a Web3 R&D organization. Johnson works on blockchain projects, but he also helped code the Inter\\xadPlanetary File System, a peer-to-peer alternative to the hypertext transfer protocol (that ‚Äúhttp://‚Äù bit at the front of every web address). Using IPFS prevents content from disappearing from the web just because a certain URL expires or changes. It‚Äôs a leading example of decentralized tech that isn‚Äôt blockchain. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of things that people try to use blockchain for that you don‚Äôt actually need a blockchain for,‚Äù Johnson says. ‚ÄúPeople try to build social networks on blockchains, and they put every tweet, or whatever they call it, and every ‚Äòlike‚Äô on the blockchain, and it‚Äôs like, What are you doing? That‚Äôs so dumb!‚Äù Johnson worries that blockchain has become a fetish. But I came to Denver wondering whether the same could be said of decentralization itself, as Web3 people understood it. Because the biggest barriers to decentralizing power may not be technological at all. Crypto‚Äôs user-unfriendliness keeps pushing the system to\\xa0do the one thing it was designed not to do:\\xa0centralize. Centralization is avague term. One of cryptocurrency‚Äôs original aims was to remove intermediaries‚Äîbanks‚Äîfrom financial transactions. (Hence its appeal among a certain set of libertarians, criminals, and lately Russian oligarchs.) That‚Äôs one way to think about centralization: A bank sits at the center of a transaction between two or more entities. But centralization and decentralization can also be framed as a matter of choice: How many options do you have? Is there just one player in the market, or can you shop around? By that standard, the banking industry is pretty decentralized. There are thousands of banks operating in the US alone. A decentralized technology does not guarantee a decentralized market. Take email. Email is a decentralized protocol. Anybody can, in theory, set up their own email server, but very few people do, as Marlinspike pointed out. Instead, people use email clients, and the market has centralized heavily around a handful of providers, especially Gmail. Even if you personally opt out of Gmail, the person on the other end of every second email you send probably uses it, meaning a copy of your email lives on Google‚Äôs servers whether you want it to or not. Centralizationis one word for this;consolidationis a better one. Consolidation is a feature not of technology but of markets. There is a much older protocol for dealing with consolidated markets than Web3. It‚Äôs called antitrust law. But government policy does not really figure into the Web3 blueprint. On the morning the toilets broke, I moderated a panel titled ‚ÄúWhy Decentralization Matters.‚Äù At one point, one of the panelists, Nick Dodson, an engineer at Fuel Labs, observed that ‚Äútraditional fintech‚Äù‚Äîpersonal finance apps that don‚Äôt use blockchains or crypto‚Äîis arguably more decentralized than Web3 ‚Äúbecause, to be honest, there‚Äôs more companies doing things.‚Äù Did you know, I asked, that the fintech sector owes much of its existence to a piece of federal legislation? The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis, has a section requiring US banks to let customers access their account data in a format that can be read by computer applications. You can thank that provision for the ability to sync up your data with personal finance apps like Betterment and Mint. On the back of this observation, I turned to one of the other panelists, Frankie Pangilinan, an accomplished blockchain programmer. Given the daunting technical challenges facing Web3, I asked, wouldn‚Äôt a simpler path to decentralization be for Congress to pass laws mandating data portability and interoperability? Wouldn‚Äôt that be easier than trying to iron out the kinks in all this complicated, unwieldy tech? ‚ÄúOh my God, what‚Äîcould you just re-ask that question? I‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù Pangilinan said, with the half-smile of someone unsure whether their leg is being pulled. I repeated myself. Wouldn‚Äôt a data portability law be easier than the whole Web3 thing? ‚ÄúGovernment moveswayslower than software does,‚Äù she said, with an incredulous laugh. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre an archaic system that we‚Äôre replacing, essentially.‚Äù Pangilinan was channeling the dominant view within the Web3 movement. Her skepticism is understandable. The internet economy arose during a period of deregulation and historically lax antitrust enforcement. The US government, in particular, has yet to prove itself capable of passing a significant law regulating Silicon Valley or winning a major lawsuit against a platform giant. Congress is, objectively speaking, an archaic system. And yet law, with all its faults, is still pretty much the most effective technology ever devised for preventing people and corporations from abusing their power‚Äîand forcing them to share it. Even within the tech sector, there‚Äôs a robust history of government intervention spurring innovation and user choice. Sometimes this comes through dramatic legal confrontations. In the 1950s, antitrust pressure from the federal government forced AT&T and its Bell Labs subsidiary to license out thousands of patents, including one for a little thing called the transistor. Other times, the role of government in decentralizing markets is practically invisible. It‚Äôs thanks to a little-known Federal Communications Commission regulation, for example, that Americans get to keep their cell phone numbers when they switch carriers. But even members of the progressive Web3 community have essentially zero interest in directing their formidable resources toward influencing public policy. They tend to think, instead, as Pangilinan put it, that government is the problem being designed around: just another institution, like Google or Facebook, that demands our trust without earning it. Later on, I chatted backstage with the third panelist, a former Ethereum core developer named Lane Rettig. He was frank about the shortcomings of crypto and Web3. But he strongly agreed with Pangilinan about the futility of government regulation. Rettig is working on a blockchain called Spacemesh. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which require tremendous computing power to mine, anyone can mine Spacemesh tokens using spare processing power on their laptop or smartphone, just by downloading an ordinary-looking app‚Äîmeaning the network could be distributed among millions of participants, rather than the tens of thousands of people who run Bitcoin or Ethereum nodes. That sounded interesting, so I pulled out my iPhone. Could I download it right then? No, Rettig said; unfortunately, Space\\xadmesh wasn‚Äôt available on phones yet. The mobile app hadn‚Äôt been built, but even if it had, Apple blocks most crypto-related apps from its App Store. In a call-back to my ‚Äúregulation is good‚Äù routine, I joked that the Open App Markets Act‚Äîa bill that has bipartisan momentum in Congress and would force Apple to permit downloading apps not offered in its App Store‚Äîwould help with that. Rettig‚Äôs eyes lit up. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bill?‚Äù he said excitedly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs huge. I can see that having big implications.‚Äù It‚Äôs not quiteright to say that crypto people are wholly uninterested in regulation. According to a recent report, the amount spent on crypto lobbying has quadrupled since 2018. But this effort isn‚Äôt aimed at using regulation to achieve the goals of decentralized markets or data portability. It‚Äôs mostly aboutblockingnew regulations that might stop the gravy train, making sure the state stays out of crypto‚Äôs way. That gravy train has a name: DeFi. Short for ‚Äúdecentralized finance,‚Äù DeFi is essentially a crypto betting market, with financial products that allow investors to gamble on cryptocurrencies via options, derivatives, and other avenues. A common one is ‚Äúyield farming,‚Äù which in essence means lending out your crypto in exchange for interest payments. DeFi is big business. The ETHDenver conference may have been a pageant of high-minded ideals, but it was overwhelmingly underwritten by DeFi companies. At any given moment, almost all the most popular Ethereum apps are some form of DeFi platform or exchange. Unlike in traditional finance, these are largely unregulated. If someone steals your money, the bank doesn‚Äôt have to pay you back‚Äîbecause there is no bank. This is far from an idle concern. One analysis found that more than $10 billion was stolen from DeFi platforms in 2021 alone. On my first night in Denver, I headed to a happy hour sponsored by Uma, which bills itself as ‚Äúa fast, flexible, and secure way to create decentralized financial products.‚Äù The event was crawling with DeFi people, each of whom assured me that their product promised super-high yields with minimal risk. Arisa Toyosaki, a former investment banker, told me about the startup she was launching, called Cega. With Cega, she explained, crypto holders will be able to invest in exotic crypto derivatives and generate healthy returns. And, she assured me, it will be nearly impossible to lose money unless the market drops more than 50\\xa0percent. How is this possible? ‚ÄúI used to do this at investment banks,‚Äù Toyosaki said. The DeFi derivative market, she said, ‚Äúexploded in the back half of 2021.‚Äù For the first time, there are enough crypto products to slice and dice into derivatives. To do that well, Toyosaki explained, you need a team of quants who can build advanced statistical models of markets. This was evidently meant to be reassuring. Just in case the parallels to the eve of the 2008 financial crisis were too subtle, my next stop was a performance by the Dutch DJ Ti√´sto that was hosted by Bacon Coin, a startup that offersmortgage-backed crypto tokens. Even as DeFi dominated the sponsorships and party calendar, many of the Web3 true believers viewed it with disdain. The rows of tables where crypto companies pitched their wares was labeled the ‚ÄúShill Zone‚Äù on the official conference map. As I was leaving a coffee shop one day, I overheard two guys sitting at a table outside. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not into DeFi,‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said the other, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not a Ponzinomics person?‚Äù Vitalik Buterin was at the next table, by the looks of it gamely letting someone shill their business to him. Even Buterin publicly worries about the cash grab taking place in the Ethereum universe he created. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt exercise our voice, the only things that get built are the things that are immediately profitable,‚Äù he recently toldTime. ‚ÄúAnd those are often far from what‚Äôs actually the best for the world.‚Äù But there‚Äôs a paradox. As much as Web3‚Äôs dreamers might shun the crypto casino, the fact remains that cryptocurrency‚Äîmoney‚Äîis the driving force of what they‚Äôre trying to build. This is where all the game theory comes in, along with the other, higher tenets of Web3. It‚Äôs\\xa0also where the Web3 movement breaks with the economic innocence of past waves of internet utopianism. In case the\\xa0parallels to the eve of the 2008 financial crisis\\xa0were too subtle,\\xa0my next stop was a startup that offers mortgage-backed crypto tokens. Back in theearly days of Web 2.0, the open source movement‚Äîthat era‚Äôs generation of idealists‚Äîwas guided by a perhaps naive belief in the willingness of people to volunteer their energies and talents for the greater good. Linux die-hards believed software should be free, recoiling at the profit motive. The platforms born in this era played to that spirit, deploying lofty rhetoric about making the world a better, more open, more connected place‚Äîwhile, in the background, quietly setting up global surveillance operations to spy on their users for the benefit of advertisers. ‚ÄúA lot of open-web, open source people always thought that money was dirty,‚Äù says Julien Genestoux, a veteran of the open source movement who created Unlock Protocol, which seeks to put memberships and subscriptions on the blockchain. ‚ÄúOne of the things crypto has been doing is putting money front and center,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBy doing this, it removes the ability of corporate actors to capture the value from everybody else without us knowing. By making it explicit, a thing we‚Äôre all staring at, we‚Äôre making it harder for the people who want to take it from everybody else.‚Äù At the most basic level, Web3‚Äôs approach to financial incentives is an ingenious way of solving new technology‚Äôs adoption problem. Let‚Äôs say you make a new decentralized platform built on the blockchain, one that works so smoothly that people can use it without getting a PhD in cryptography. Users control their own data and everything is open source. The thing is, those ordinary users probably don‚Äôt care much about data ownership or immutable public ledgers. They care about convenience and fun and being where their friends are. So how do you get anyone to use your new Web3 app? The answer is tokenomics. The business model of nearly every proposed Web3 platform entails distributing tokens to everyone involved, thus incentivizing them to use and improve the platform to make the value of those tokens go up. In Web3-speak, this is called ‚Äúaligning the incentives.‚Äù The concept has its roots in Bitcoin, whose pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, devised a set of rules to prevent conflict between an individual‚Äôs self-interest and the interests of Bitcoin. Using game theory principles, Bitcoin could incentivize everyone to act for the collective good. Even if someone took control of enough of the network to be able to rewrite its history and inflate their account, they would have a powerful reason not to: Such treachery would kill confidence in Bitcoin and thus crater the value of their own holdings. Many people see Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as pyramid schemes, since their value is a pure function of there being someone else who wants to buy in. But tokenomics can, at least theoretically, serve a useful purpose out in the real world. Take Presearch, a Web3 search engine. Presearch is distributed across a network of nodes that anyone can set up on their computer or a virtual private server. Your search term gets passed to one of the nodes, which queries a range of sources before returning a response. People who run nodes are rewarded in the form of PRE tokens, Presearch‚Äôs custom crypto coin. Users can also be rewarded with tiny micropayments of the token for performing searches. As the platform gets more popular, the tokens should become more valuable. That value has a real-world reference point: Advertisers have to buy tokens in order to appear above search results. Will this work? Perhaps not. But it‚Äôs not a Ponzi scheme. Web3 apps promise not just to pay users but to give them a say in how the platforms are run. In the case of Presearch, for example, the PRE token will confer ownership and some kind of governance power over the platform. In theory, that distributed structure should prevent anyone from pushing Presearch in any shady or exploitative directions. ‚ÄúWhy are we not going to end up like Google?‚Äù says Presearch‚Äôs founder, Colin Pape, referring to the search giant‚Äôs well documented privacy issues. ‚ÄúBecause we have everyone aligned around this one value unit, and if we try to extract too much value from users, and they get pissed off, the value of the token goes down.‚Äù That sounds plausible in the abstract, but it raises all sorts of practical questions. How do you keep someone from buying enough tokens to exert unilateral control? How do you know the crypto accounts holding tokens belong to separate human beings? If you do manage to keep things decentralized, how will you act quickly enough to compete with traditional businesses that don‚Äôt have to put every single decision to a vote? The answers are all speculative, because none of that governance stuff actually exists yet. Pape admits that decentralized control remains an aspiration for Presearch. The reality is that the company, meaning Pape, controls the search engine, just like Alphabet controls Google. This is something of a theme in the Web3 world. Everyone has a white paper spelling out how their new platform will be governed by ‚Äúthe community‚Äù ‚Ä¶ eventually, ultimately, at some future point yet to be determined, once a whole bunch of other issues are sorted out and the platform gets big enough to remove the training wheels.Oh Lord, give me decentralized control, but not yet. If the vision of collectively run mega-platforms sounds implausibly far out, the highest tenets of Web3 are somehow even more ambitious. Using blockchain technology and tokenomics to get people to buy into a set of decentralized apps? That‚Äôs just the beginning. For some Web3 luminaries, the real goal is to use cryptocurrencies to lock human beings into a more cooperative, less self-destructive society. I didn‚Äôt fully understand this until I met Kevin Owocki. Few people aretrying harder to turn the idealism of Web3 into reality than Owocki. A resident of Boulder County, near Denver, Owocki is the founder of GitCoin, a platform for funding open source Web3 projects that has raised and distributed roughly $60 million so far. He was one of the most Colorado of the many Colorado guys on hand at ETHDenver, with long hair past his shoulders, a trim beard, and an athletic build. At one point, when I said I was thirsty, he pulled a can of kombucha out of his back pocket and handed it to me. Owocki was something of a rock star at the conference. He is credited with coining the term BUIDL in 2017. Admirers approached him nonstop to talk, express their support, or ask for a copy of his book,GreenPilled: How Crypto Can Regenerate the World, which was the talk of the conference and quickly sold out of the 400 copies he had ordered. Owocki is about as far from a casino person as you‚Äôll find in the crypto world. In one of several presentations he gave, Owocki told the crowd that since research shows money stops increasing happiness after about $100,000 in annual income, Web3 founders should maximize their happiness by giving their excess money to public goods that everyone gets to enjoy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs cypherpunk, which is all about privacy, decentralization: hardcore libertarian shit,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more of a leftist. I‚Äôm more solarpunk, which is, how do we solve our contemporary problems around sustainability and equitable economic systems? It‚Äôs a different set of values.‚Äù The internet, he explained, made it possible to move information between computers. This revolutionized communication. Blockchains have made it possible to move units of value between computers. Owocki believes this can be harnessed to revolutionize how human beings interact through something he calls ‚Äúregenerative cryptoeconomics.‚Äù Crypto\\xadeconomics, he writes inGreenPilled, ‚Äúis the use of blockchain-based incentives to design new kinds of systems, applications, or networks.‚ÄùRegenerativecryptoeconomics means doing this in a way that makes the world a better place for everyone. The goal is to break free from the zero-sum, rich-get-richer patterns of capitalism. Owocki believes that the right cryptoeconomic structure can help solve collective action problems like climate change, misinformation, and an underfunded digital infrastructure. The key tool for achieving this is adecentralized autonomous organization. In theory, a DAO (yes, pronounced the same as the ancient Chinese word for the way of the universe) uses crypto\\xadcurrency to boost collective action. Typically, members join by buying some amount of a custom token issued by the DAO. That entitles them to an ownership stake in the DAO itself. Member-owners vote on what the DAO does‚Äîwhich is mostly to say, what it spends money on, since a blockchain-based entity can do little besides move funds from one address to another. The young concept already has a checkered history. The first DAO, named simply ‚ÄúThe DAO,‚Äù collapsed in 2016 after someone exploited a loophole in its code to siphon off what was then worth some $50 million in Ethereum currency. Similarly colorful failures have followed. DAOs were nonetheless all the rage at ETHDenver, where attendees waxed on about their world-changing potential. Kimbal Musk, Elon‚Äôs photogenic brother, spoke about his Big Green DAO, a food-related charity. Giving away money via a DAO, he insisted, got rid of all the painful bureaucracy of philanthropic nonprofits. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs way better,‚Äù he said, though he also granted that ‚Äúthere are many ways to fail, and this one could fail spectacularly.‚Äù What is it about a DAO that‚Äîunlike, say, a Kickstarter page‚Äîfrees humanity from the collective action problems that threaten to doom the species? According to Owocki, it‚Äôs the ability to write code in ways that tinker with incentive structures. (In this sense, the first DAO was arguably Bitcoin itself.) ‚ÄúOur weapon of choice is novel mechanism designs, based upon sound game theory, deployed to decentralized blockchain networks as transparent open source code,‚Äù he writes inGreenPilled.Indeed, the book has very little to say about technology, per se, and much more to say about various game theory concepts. These range from the sort of thing you‚Äôd learn in an undergrad econ class‚Äî‚Äúpublic goods are non-\\xadexcludable and non-rivalrous‚Äù‚Äîto things that wouldn‚Äôt be out of place in a sci-fi novel: ‚Äúcommunity inclusion currencies,‚Äù ‚Äúfractal DAO protocols,‚Äù ‚Äúretroactive public goods funding.‚Äù It‚Äôs hard enough for me to grasp how a DAO works. So while I‚Äôm in Denver,\\xa0I create one. One of the most powerful incentive design techniques, according to Owocki, is something called quadratic voting. Standing near the edge of the Shill Zone, Owocki turned around to show me the back of his purple baseball jacket, which said ‚ÄúQuadratic Lands.‚Äù The Quadratic Lands, Owocki explained, are a mythical place where the laws of economics have been redesigned to produce public goods. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a meme,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to tell you it already exists.‚Äù (Everyone at ETHDenver was concerned, rightly, about my ability to separate metaphorical claims from literal ones.) In a quadratic voting system, you get a budget to allocate among various options. Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs dollars, though it could be any unit. The more dollars you allocate to a particular choice, the more your vote for it counts. But there‚Äôs an important caveat: Each marginal dollar you pledge to the same choice is worth less than the previous one. (Technically, the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of your vote rises quadratically, rather than linearly.) This makes it harder for the richest people in a group to dominate the vote. GitCoin uses an adaptation, quadratic funding, to award money to Web3 projects. The number of people who contribute to a given project counts more than the amount they contribute. This rewards ideas supported by the most people rather than the wealthiest: regenerative cryptonomics in action. Glen Weyl, the polymathic Microsoft researcher who came up with quadratic voting, is far more cautious than Owocki about its applicability to blockchain. In a foreword to Owocki‚Äôs book, he writes, ‚ÄúI am deeply ambivalent about Web3.‚Äù He has positioned himself as a sort of insider critic of the movement, one who supports its broad goals of decentralization and digital public goods but questions its faith in the potential of blockchains and cryptocurrencies in their current state. Weyl walked me through the weaknesses of using quadratic voting in a DAO. A major problem is Sybil attacks, in which one person creates a thousand ‚Äúsock puppet‚Äù accounts and uses them to take over the voting. Even if you come up with a solution to the proof-of-\\xadidentity problem so that it‚Äôs hard to make duplicate accounts, someone could just get people in the analog world to create accounts on their behalf. Imagine, Weyl said, if the Chinese government wanted to take over a DAO. All it would have to do is instruct its citizens to join and hand over control of their wallets. Owocki believes he and his co-revolutionaries can sort out these problems. He asked if I‚Äôd heard of the Matthew Effect, which, he explained, is how economists refer to the fact that the rich tend to get richer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fundamental law of economics,‚Äù he said, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs unbeatable. Conquering laws of nature is what technology is for. ‚ÄúAn airplane upends gravity; what if you can build an economic system that upends the Matthew Effect? Dude, quadratic voting is it.‚Äù All of thisis getting a little heady for me. Never mind the furthest reaches of Owocki‚Äôs theory; it‚Äôs hard enough for me to grasp how a DAO is supposed to work. So while I‚Äôm in Denver, I decide tocreate one. My friend Jacks√≥n Smith works for a nonprofit called Learning Economy Foundation that researches the use of blockchain in education. He‚Äôs at the conference and agrees to help me create the DAO. We settle on an admittedly low-stakes idea: Our DAO will try to winThe New Yorkermagazine‚Äôs weekly cartoon caption contest, in which readers compete to supply the wittiest punch line to a captionless cartoon. Each week, the DAO members will vote on each other‚Äôs submissions and submit the internal winner to the actual contest. We call it lmaoDAO. I put in serious hours on the DAO over the weekend, but not as many as Jacks√≥n and a couple of his coworkers, who actually know how to program and generously volunteer time to build it, and whom I half-jokingly start referring to as ‚Äúmy core devs.‚Äù I should say, to BUIDL it. We‚Äôre BUIDLers, officially hacking together a Web3 application in the spirit of ETHDenver. I am somewhat surprised to find that, when I explain what I‚Äôm doing, people at the conference are unfailingly supportive. I thought they might take exception to a journalist creating a DAO as a stunt, an act of mild trolling, but the general sense is that we‚Äôve come up with a clever idea. Web3 is a realm where coders can feel good again about working in tech. Two things becomevery clear as we create the DAO. First, a DAO is nothing more than a group whose membership requires owning a crypto token‚Äîin our case, a custom LMAO coin that we mint out of thin air. Like most DAOs, ours is organized on Discord, a Web 2.0 application. Our DAO isn‚Äôt really decentralized; we control the Discord, Jacks√≥n controls the voting website, and I manually submit the captions to NewYorker.com. We've committed in principle to building out decentralized governance, but who knows when that will happen. In the meantime, everyone else has to trust that we‚Äôre doing what we say we are. The second thing that becomes clear is that BUIDLing is really fun. Setting up a DAO is a bit like designing a video game. You have to create incentives and rules that will keep people playing and can‚Äôt be easily exploited. In fact, it feels like a game within a game, because Web3 itself is not unlike an immersive RPG‚Äîan alternate reality with its own rules, customs, and language. Play for long enough and you stop having to check the instructions. All kinds of esoteric jargon starts making sense.Switch your wallet from the Ethereum mainnet to the Gnosis chain to claim your LMAO tokens. Sync your tokens with the \\xadcollab.land Discord bot to prove you‚Äôre a member and get access to the locked Discord channels. The real fun of BUIDLing lies in the problem-solving. How will we get people to join, for example? Nathan, one of my devs, comes up with an idea: He can scrape every crypto wallet that holds either a Bufficorn NFT or ETHDenver meal tokens, and use that as a proxy for people who attended the conference. Then we can ‚Äúairdrop‚Äù our custom token to everyone on that list. Most intoxicatingly, this all takes place in a relatively closed system. Very few of these decisions require us to think much about the messy world outside the confines of our DAO. It all helps me understand the draw of Web3. The sense of moral valor that once accompanied working in Web 2.0 is harder to find these days. Whatever else Web3 is, it‚Äôs a realm where coders and technologists can reconnect with the joy of hacking, where they can feel good again about working in tech. Jacks√≥n, who in fact builds elaborate board games as a hobby, tells me that escapism is part of Web3‚Äôs appeal. The question is whether the escape hatch leads to a real place or a fantasyland. As those pizza crusts and empty snack bags pile up, I realize that it‚Äôs Saturday evening, and dinnertime is approaching. There‚Äôs a rumor that Snoop Dogg, who recently announced his intention to turn Death Row Records into an NFT music label, is throwing a party somewhere. But I have plans to meet up with my childhood friend Dave, who lives in Denver. As Dave and I catch up over tacos and margaritas, I feel slightly crazed, struggling to explain what I‚Äôve been up to: Web3, cryptoeconomics, BUIDLing a DAO. I‚Äôm a bit like Dorothy returned from Oz. Gradually, talk drifts to normal stuff: his family, my job, a trip we‚Äôve been planning. That night, I sleep in Dave‚Äôs basement, and on Sunday morning I‚Äôm woken early by the patter of his 2-year-old daughter‚Äôs feet. The guys at the conference seem to really believe they‚Äôre building a better world for her, but in the morning light it‚Äôs hard to take seriously the idea that her future depends on precisely calibrating a bunch of incentives in a blockchain membership organization. It all feels like a game that I‚Äôve unplugged from. Then my phone buzzes. My services are needed before the DAO can officially launch. Without thinking much of it, I plug myself back in.

Do you everfind yourself wondering, ‚ÄúWhat is Web3?‚Äù You‚Äôre not alone. The idea is having a moment, whether you‚Äôre measuring byVC funding,lobbying blitzes, orincomprehensible corporate announcements. But it can be hard to tell what all the hype is about. To believers,Web3represents the next phase of the internet and, perhaps, of organizing society. Web 1.0, the story goes, was the era of decentralized, open protocols, in which most online activity involved navigating to individual static webpages. Web 2.0, which we‚Äôre living through now, is the era of centralization, in which a huge share of communication and commerce takes place on closed platforms owned by a handful of super-powerful corporations‚Äîthink Google, Facebook, Amazon‚Äîsubject to the nominal control of centralized government regulators. Web3 is supposed to break the world free of that monopolistic control. At the most basic level, Web3 refers to a decentralized online ecosystem based on the blockchain. Platforms and apps built on Web3 won‚Äôt be owned by a central gatekeeper, but rather by users, who will earn their ownership stake by helping to develop and maintain those services. Gavin Wood coined the term Web3 (originally Web 3.0) in 2014. At the time, he was fresh off of helping develop Ethereum, the cryptocurrency that is second only to Bitcoin in prominence and market size. Today he runs the Web3 Foundation, which supports decentralized technology projects, as well as Parity Technologies, a company focused on building blockchain infrastructure for Web3. Wood, who is based in Switzerland, spoke with me last week over video about where Web 2.0 went wrong, his vision of the future, and why we all need to be less trusting. The following interview is a transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length. WIRED: As I understand it, the idea of Web3 at its most basic level is that the current setup, Web 2.0, is no good. So before we talk about what Web3 would entail, how would you describe the problems with the status quo? Gavin Wood: I think the model for Web 2.0 was much the same as the model for society before the internet existed. If you go back 500 years, people basically just stuck to their little villages and townships. And they traded with people that they knew. And they relied on, broadly speaking, the social fabric, to ensure that expectations were credible, were likely to actually happen: These apples are not rotten, or this horseshoe doesn‚Äôt break after three weeks. And that works reasonably well, because it‚Äôs difficult and very time-consuming and expensive to move between towns. So you have a reasonably high level of credibility that someone is going to stick around and they don't want to be exiled. But as society moved into something larger-scale, and we have cities and countries and international organizations, we moved on to this weird kind ofbrandreputation thing. We've created these powerful but regulated bodies, and the regulators, in principle, ensure that our expectations are met. There are certain statutory requirements that, to operate in a particular industry, you must fulfill. This is not a great solution, for a few reasons. One of them is, it's very hard to regulate new industries. The government is slow, it takes a while to catch up. Another is that regulators are imperfect. And especially when they work closely with the industry, oftentimes there's a bit of a revolving door relationship between the industry and the regulator. Another is simply a regulatory body has very limited firepower. It's how much money the government puts into it. And so necessarily, regulation is going to be patchy. They will be able to regulate maybe the biggest offenders but they aren‚Äôt able to retain a really strong influence all the time everywhere. And of course, the regulators and the laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If you go somewhere in the EU, then Activity X is fine; if you go somewhere else, then it‚Äôs not fine. And as we become a very international society, this effectively means that your expectations are still not being met. So we need to move beyond this. But unfortunately, Web 2.0 very much still exists in this very centralized model. Are we really talking about a failure of technology? Or are we talking about a failure of governance and regulation and competition policy? It sounds like you‚Äôre saying: Yes, it‚Äôs a failure of regulation, but the answer isn‚Äôt better regulation; there needs to be a new layer of technology, because regulatory failures are inevitable. Am I characterizing your view correctly? Yeah, absolutely. The model is broken. So let's talk about what should replace it. We've been talking about why Web 2.0 is not working. What's your handy elevator definition of Web3? ‚ÄúLess trust, more truth.‚Äù What does ‚Äúless trust‚Äù mean? I have a particular meaning of trust that‚Äôs essentially faith. It's the belief that something will happen, that the world will work in a certain way, without any real evidence or rational arguments as to why it will do that. So we want less of that, and we want more truth‚Äîwhich what I really mean is a greater reason to believe that our expectations will be met. It sounds like you're saying ‚Äúless blind faith, more credible trustworthiness.‚Äù Yes and no. I think trust in itself is actually just a bad thing all around. Trust implies that you are you're placing some sort of authority in somebody else, or in some organization, and they will be able to use this authority in some arbitrary way. As soon as it becomescredibletrust, it's not really trust anymore. There is a mechanism, a rationale, an argument, a logical mechanism‚Äîwhatever‚Äî but in my mind, it's not trust. You've written that Web3 will bust platform monopolies like Google and Facebook. Can you explain how it will do that? Yeah, I guess the thing is, I don't know if it's going to‚ÄîI mean, I think it's a logical improvement. And I think in the grander scheme, it‚Äôs inevitable. Either it‚Äôs inevitable or society‚Äôs going down the pan. But in terms of concrete, it‚Äôs a much more difficult question to answer. But, OK. In terms of technology, what do we have? We have cryptography. Cryptography, at its basic level, allows me to talk to my friend but for the communication channel to be public or go through a third party with me still having a good level of expectation, credible expectation, that it will be a private conversation. It will be as private as if we were in a field and chatting to each other and could see there was nobody around. Just taking encrypted communication as an example, that so far seems very compatible with corporate monopoly. Like, WhatsApp offers encrypted communication. There‚Äôs some controversy over the degree to which that is truly satisfying your desire for privacy, but I would still argue that that‚Äôs an example of encrypted communication that‚Äôs controlled by one of the most powerful companies in the world and has billions of users. It's an interesting one, and on the face of it, sure. But there are a few important differences. One of them is, what if WhatsApp introduced into their service a key that allowed them to decrypt all conversations? How do we know that it‚Äôs not there? You have totrust. We can't see the code, we can't see how their service runs, we can't see their key structure. So all we have is the blind trust that they are telling the truth. Now, OK, maybe they tell the truth because they're scared that their reputation will take a big hit if they don't. But then, as we saw with some of the Snowden revelations, sometimes companies don't get an opportunity to tell the truth. Sometimes, security services can just install a box in their back office, and they're told, ‚ÄúYou don't need to look at this box, you're not allowed to say or do anything about this box, you just have to sit quietly.‚Äù It sounds like open source software would accomplish what you‚Äôre talking about, but you‚Äôre not just describing open source software. When we talk about Web3, we're talking about the blockchain, which is a completely different way of architecting the internet. So how, technologically, do you achieve this lack of dependence on trust? I think a degree of truth is necessary. And by this I mean openness, transparency. Blockchain technology uses both cryptography and certain game theory economics to deliver its service. We need to understand the node infrastructure of the network; is it really peer-to-peer or is it actually run from one data center by a company that manufactures and sells hardware and is required to be consulted before a new node can come online? The details make the difference as to whether it's basically just Web 2.0 in disguise or whether it is actually legitimately open, transparent, decentralized, peer-to-peer. Let's drill down on the idea of ‚Äúdecentralized.‚Äù I mean, the internet already is decentralized, right? Internet protocols are not owned by a company. While on a practical level, people tend to route their behavior through gatekeeper platforms, they don't necessarily have to. You don'thaveto message on Facebook, it's just convenient. So when we talk about centralization and decentralization, what does that mean? In essence, it means I personally can become a provider or a co-provider of this overall service just as easily as anybody else in the world. How realistic is that, though? From where I sit, it‚Äôs hard to imagine anyone outside of a small subset of people with high technical literacy actually exercising that right to participate in providing the service. And in that scenario, it sounds like you would have a different kind of centralization. Perhaps it would be more than just, you know, a handful of all-powerful CEOs, but it would still be a small subset of people for whom that's a meaningful freedom. There's a big difference between having a right or a freedom that you could execute if you had bothered educating yourself well enough, and the inability at a very basic and fundamental level of doing something because you lack the inclusion in an exclusive group. If I educate myself well enough on material that is freely available, and that's all that is required to become a co-provider of the service, then that is a free service. I went to law school, and I could say, look, anybody could learn the law. Anybody could study, get into law school, and then study for the bar. But in fact, at least in the US, it is a guild with very high barriers to entry, most notably cost. Even if the barriers to entry in the legal profession are higher than in programming, that doesn't necessarily mean that the barriers to entry in the world that you come from are not meaningfully high. I understand the distinction you‚Äôre drawing, but I wonder if that's sort of a naive‚Äîforgive me‚Äîreading of social arrangements to think that everybody just kind of has the choice to go become an expert Web3 programmer? No, of course. In principle, this isn't about being a Web3 programmer. You should be able to enjoy most of the ability to evaluate something without being an in-depth core developer. But there are an awful lot more programmers in the world than there are lawyers. And there's a good reason for that. Programming a machine actually only requires knowledge of a language that is reasonably straightforward to learn. You can be in a random little village in India, that just happens to have an internet point, and you can learn JavaScript in a week. You can't do that with American law. I‚Äôm not going to try and persuade you that literally every person in the world could do this. But the point is that the more people that can do this, the lower the barrier, the better. This still feels a little abstract. Someone who's reading this might be thinking, ‚ÄúWhat would I bedoingin a Web3 world?‚ÄùCan you sketch out what that might look like? A certain a certain kind of activity or app interface or transaction? I think I think the initial breed of Web3 applications will probably be mostly small iterations on Web 2.0 applications. But one thing that Web3 brings that Web 2.0 cannot easily service is financial obligations or economically strong applications. This is where individuals in a peer to peer fashion can have economic services between themselves. This isn't about sending money per se, but it's about sending things that are or can be credibly rare, or credibly difficult, or credibly expensive in some way. So we can imagine, for example, dating apps where you can send virtual flowers, but we can only send one bunch of virtual flowers per day, regardless of how much you pay. And one could imagine, therefore, that sending a bunch of flowers every day to the same person is a very strong signal that they're into you. And this is a signal that you can‚Äôt game‚Äîthat's the whole point. You can't pay to send more flowers. I don't mean to be a killjoy, but I feel like Tinder could just add that functionality to Tinder. Theycould,right. They sort of do‚Äîthere‚Äôs the star thing that you can only do once per day. But guess what? They're a profit-motivated company. So if you pay Tinder enough, you can just send as many stars as you want. But won‚Äôt companies built on Web3 still have the same market incentives as Web 2.0 companies? I could be missing something obvious, but it's hard to think of technological developments throughout history that didn‚Äôt allow for more concentration of political or economic power. So why should we expect this blockchain-based, decentralized Web3 to break the mold? I've always been into technology, since being a youth. I learned to code when I was like eight years old. I've never seen a technology that existed to limit one‚Äôs power. As you've said, every technology that I can think of has served to make the user more powerful. They can do more stuff. They can be richer, they can fulfill the service that they provide faster or better or to more people. Blockchain doesn't do that. It's fundamentally different. It's effectively a social construct. It's a set of rules. And the only thing that these rules have going for themselves is that there is no one with arbitrary power within the system. You can be reasonably certain, especially if you're a coder, then you can you can look at the code and know that it's doing the right thing. But you can also be reasonably certain just on the basis of the fact that so many people have joined the network on the back of this expectation. And if this expectation were not met, they would just leave the network. A lot of people have gravitated toward crypto because they see it as a way to overthrow the existing political order or the power of central banks. But you've suggested that Web3 will help support the liberal, postwar order. How do you see it doing that? I think the services and the expectations that we have are under threat because of the centralization of power that the technology allows. It's just a fact. There's not much that has come along before Facebook and Google that allowed that level of power for such few people. It's not that I don‚Äôt think Facebook and Google and all the rest of it deserve to be displaced, but that's not exactly the crux of Web3. For me, Web3 is actually much more of a larger sociopolitical movement that is moving away from arbitrary authorities into a much more rationally based liberal model. And this is the only way I can see of safeguarding the liberal world, the life that we have come to enjoy over the last 70 years. It's the only way that we can actually keep it going 70 more years into the future. And at the moment, I think we are very much flirting with quite a different direction.

[Gadget Lab intro theme music plays.] LG: Hey everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I\\'m Lauren Goode. I\\'m a senior writer on the blockchain. I\\'m a senior writer at WIRED. MC: My name is Michael Calore. I\\'m a senior editor at WIRED. LG: Which is also on the blockchain. MC: Oh no. LG: We\\'re also joined by WIRED senior writer, Gilad Edelman, blockchain expert. Gilad Edelman: This is going to be a disaster. LG: All right. So today we\\'re talking about the web. You may have heard of it. What you may be a little bit less familiar with is this idea of Web3 A.K.A, the next phase of the web. It\\'s a buzzword that\\'s been thrown around a lot by Silicon Valley lately. But what does it actually mean for how we\\'re going to experience the web? So, Gilad, this week you talked with the person who coined the term, Web3. His name is Gavin Wood, and we\\'ve run this as a Q&A WIRED.com, which everyone should go read. But tell us, what is Web3? GE: Web3 is, as you say, it\\'s a buzzword. It\\'s not any one concretely defined concept. But the idea is that it\\'s the next phase of the Web. So Web1 is go back to the \\'90s era. This is the static webpage. It\\'s very decentralized. This is an important point. Typically, you would type in a URL and go to that site to engage with stuff. MC: And that would be like a server in a building somewhere? GE: Exactly. MC: And each one is different? GE: Right. And in the internet\\'s early days, it just existed on everybody\\'s computers. Web2, it refers to the era that we\\'re living in now, where you have a lot of concentration of online activity in dominant platforms. So this is the era of the dynamic app layer or the dynamic web page layer on top of the internet. And so, a lot of online activity has got funneled through platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Amazon. And a bit further up Stack, you have a lot of... Or down the Stack, I can never remember the arrow there, but you also have concentration of computing, right? AWS, or other major Cloud providers. So there are all sorts of reasons that people are unhappy with the status quo. So the idea of Web3 is to bring back that early spirit of decentralization using the blockchain. LG: So does Web3 have to exist on the blockchain and have to involve cryptocurrencies? How fundamental is the blockchain to what it is? GE: That\\'s a really good question. Because at the broadest level of abstraction, the idea here is decentralization, which is a concept. It\\'s not a particular technology. But the energy here is really coming from the blockchain. And when people talk about Web3, they\\'re absolutely talking about blockchain-related technologies. So Gavin Wood told me that, the thing about blockchain is that it\\'s the only technology he\\'s ever come across that\\'s about distributing power rather than centralizing power. And I don\\'t know if I totally buy that, but there are reasons to believe that that might be true in the sense that... I mean, the whole point of blockchain going back to Bitcoin is that you don\\'t need a central authority saying what\\'s true and what\\'s false. Because the innovation of the blockchain that made Bitcoin such a big thing to begin with is that the ledger, the record keeping is distributed and it\\'s happening on all of the computers that are in the network. To somebody like Gavin Wood, that\\'s a really powerful idea, because in his view, a huge problem right now is that we have to trust central gatekeepers like monopolistic tech companies, and also like the centralized government regulators that supposedly have power over them. And so, to somebody like Gavin Wood and other people who are excited about this technology, the promise of using blockchain is that you can somehow break free of that need to put your faith in a central authority. MC: And also break free of the possibility of being regulated? It seems to me like that\\'s part of the motivation here. Because if the argument is that the internet is broken, because all the tools that we use are part of these large platforms that are owned by big corporations, that\\'s not necessarily true. As you pointed out in your Q&A, the internet is built on Open Source Software, and that Software talks to each other using protocols that nobody owns. So if I wanted to, I could build a server in my home and start serving my own webpages and run my own email server and run my own Mastodon server. I could do all of these things on my own right now as it exists. So why is that something that needs to be fixed? Is the move towards Web3 like all the technologists are saying, \"Oh, Web3 is the future?\" Are they actually saying, \"We need to build a new layer on top of this technology that already exists\"? Or are they calling for a return to the more pure days of the web before the platform\\'s dominated? GE: It is. We are talking about a new layer because as you say, and as I mentioned, thanks for calling that, I thought that was pretty smart, in the Q&A, the internet as distinct from the web, is decentralized already. MC: Yeah. LG: Mm-hmm. GE: Or- MC: You can build anything decentralized on the internet now if you want. GE: Right. And as you say, Mastodon is a decentralized, open-source Twitter alternative, right? That\\'s what Mastodon is, Twitter alternative? MC: Yes. LG: Mm-hmm. MC: Yes. It\\'s easy to forget. GE: Yeah. Yeah. This is such a frothy mix of different ideas that there\\'s different answers to that question. There\\'s a lot of economic activity happening right now in the crypto space that, especially on display with wave of ICOs, initial coin offerings a couple years ago, that looked pretty clearly like regulatory arbitrage, where you were getting people to invest in something just like you were with a security or stock, but because it was something different, it was a coin. It didn\\'t have to register with the SCC. You didn\\'t have to follow regulations and all lot ordinary people lost their shirts. So there is that side of it. But, I think the attitude of the ideologically motivated Web3 people like a Gavin wood. And when I don\\'t even mean ideological as a pejorative, just people who are motivated sort of by philosophical commitments. It\\'s not wanting to get around regulation so much as having no faith in regulation. So when I look at a problem like Google stranglehold over so much of the internet and advertising markets and mobile markets and browsing and search and everything, to me that looks like a policy problem. And a lot of people treat it as a policy problem, right. And? And the FTC and the DOJ and state attorneys general are working on that problem right now. But a lot of people in the Web3 space, somewhat understandably just have no faith in the government fixing the monopoly problem. And so they turn to the appeal of technological solutions rather than policy solutions. LG: I want to bring it back to the actual experience on Web3, because you asked Gavin Wood a really good question. You asked him for a specific example of how this would work. How two app developers or creators, or even consumers would use an app that is built on Web3. How did he describe this? GE: I didn\\'t totally pin him down on this, but I think the answer is, it wouldn\\'t look that different in theory from apps that we interact with now. Because the main differences are going to be things that are below the surface level or the user level. But I actually had an interesting conversation yesterday with the founder of a company called Presearch. And this is a search engine that is designed to be a Google alternative. It\\'s a very privacy focused search engine and it\\'s incorporating a lot of Web3 principles. So for example... I mean, on a technical level, it\\'s distributed in the sense that instead of having a bunch of servers in a warehouse running the software, it\\'s actually users can elect to be nodes in the network. And so it is decentralizing that respect. When you put in a search query, it gets routed to nodes in the network. And to incentivize people to volunteer their computing power in that way, there\\'s a coin associated with it, a token, a crypto token associated with it. And this is a really common feature of Web3 businesses, which parenthetically that mostly don\\'t exist. Most Web3 businesses are business ideas or proposals and not actual businesses, but there are some that are closer to reality and Presearch is one of them. The privacy browser Brave is actually maybe the most established. But this idea of decentralization is still hypothetical. As Colin, the founder of this company, freely acknowledge when we were talking yesterday, he said, so far, Presearch still controls how its business functions, how the software works. But in theory, one day he would like to see a setup where the users and the people, the stakeholders, who hold these coins, and by the way, you also get rewarded just by doing searches, they will have some way of participating in the governance of the platform. And this is a crucial idea behind the Web3 vision. Is that you, the user, or the participant, you are somehow active in providing the service and maybe literally voting on how things happen. LG: We\\'re going to have to take a quick break, but I did want to ask you, how does this creation of applications for Web3 create value in the goods that people are exchanging on the internet? Because we\\'re hearing about how this is going to open things up for the creator economy who make digital goods or apps. How does that actually work? GE: Yes. That\\'s such a good question. It depends exactly what you\\'re talking about. So in the case of a Web3 company, like the one I was just talking about, generally, the economic value here is from the token associated with it. So for example, with Presearch, the idea is that advertisers who instead of just bidding with dollars to have their ad displayed at the top of the search results, they have to bid in this coin. But they don\\'t actually spend the coin. They stake it. So they have to buy the coins if they want a bid in the auction. And then if they win the auction, those coins are staked, which basically means you can\\'t use them, they\\'re kind of locked up. And the point here is that, this is generating demand for the token, which raises the value of the token. And then on the flip side, you get rewarded in fractions of a token every time you do a search. So the idea here, which is very common when you talk to Web3 entrepreneurs, is all about in aligning the incentives so that everybody in the network or the exchange that you\\'re talking about, is motivated by the value of the token. And the thing that I haven\\'t figured out yet is, is this just a Ponzi scheme or multi-level marketing? And I\\'m not saying that it\\'s a conscious scam. Because a lot of these entrepreneurs and founders I\\'m talking to are very high minded and idealistic. But at a certain point, if the value proposition here is just coming from increasing demand for this asset over time and the value of the asset doesn\\'t have any external referent, then there\\'s something a little bit ponzi-ish about it. I haven\\'t really made up my mind. MC: What\\'s holding the house up. GE: Right. LG: Right. Or is it just false scarcity. OK, I think you\\'ve hit the right note of skepticism for us to take a break and then come back and resume that part of the conversation. So stay tuned. We\\'ll be right back. [Break] LG: So Web3 is really just one part of a bigger conversation that\\'s happening right now. About what the future of the web will really look like. Some high profile technologists, yeah, we couldn\\'t get through one week of the podcast without mentioning Mark Zuckerberg, are drawing out these visions right now, or introducing these new frameworks for the web, this next set of connected experiences. But I\\'m curious how realistic are these pie in the sky ideas and is it going to make the internet any more equal than it is right now? So Gilad, as you were talking to Gavin wood about Web3 and these other entrepreneurs who you\\'ve now been able to chat with, which elements of this vision struck you as legit, and which part seemed a little bit more like science fiction? GE: So far, my feeling is that the strong version of the pitch for Web3 is that it\\'s going to break the stranglehold, the power of the central gatekeepers, like the Googles and the Apples and the Facebooks. And I\\'ve yet to figure out why that would be true. So, so far to me, that feels like science fiction. However, is there room for alternative businesses that maybe appeal to more technically minded audiences or user bases and can find ways to monetize through having their own tokens or coins in a none scammy way? I\\'m coming around to thinking that the answer to that could be, yes. I think there\\'s something to these alternate business models, but there\\'s more of a philosophical question, which is, will this technology really lead to more distribution of power, of wealth, of value, of creativity, or will it like just about every technological innovation in history, find a way to facilitate greater concentration and let the rich get richer and the powerful get more powerful. And the jury is still out on that. I mean, just because you\\'re using the blockchain doesn\\'t mean that there\\'s nobody with more power. There\\'s people who hold more of the coins. There\\'s people who manage the protocols. There\\'s people who have power off the blockchain that they can use to influence events on the blockchain. And I don\\'t know when we\\'re going to find out the answers to this question. I mean, you could look at it as Bitcoin only a little more than a decade old. Think about how long it took from the invention of the internet protocols, evening the invention of email, till we got to a point where people understood how you could use it and browsers existed, that was a long time. Or you could say, Bitcoin has been around as long as the... The blockchain has been around as long as the iPhone, where\\'s our apps? MC: Yeah. And I\\'m going to back you up with that cynical worldview, because I do believe that like once a platform becomes valuable, then it\\'s open for manipulation by capital and people who want to control it, right? And these new Web3 systems that we\\'re talking about are going to become valuable when people actually start using them. So as the network grows and becomes more widespread, then it creates more value for all the users. And it creates more value for people who want to use it to make money. Advertisers, BCs, whatever. So you\\'re talking about like building a new system with this new tech, and the technology is based on trust and transparency. And those things are not... Trust and transparency in a system, and that system being valuable are not mutually exclusive. GE: Right. But I would also say just to your point about the value coming when as a network grows, this is such a point because you have to ask yourself, what\\'s going to make the user want to... The person want to use some Web3 alternative to existing, right? Why would I sign up for a Web3-based social network, right? Why would I use a Web3-based search engine? And as- MC: Because you believe in Web3, and you want to... You have to already be the game in order to want to play, right? GE: Yeah. I said to Colin Pape, the founder of Preearch yesterday, I don\\'t think that people\\'s complaint about Google is that the ledger is too mutable. LG: Right. You\\'re complaining that now when they Google something, there are six ads that come at time of the feed. GE: And to his credit, he fully acknowledge that he said, \"Look for now, our target audience is definitely people who care about this. People who are more tech savvy. And over time, once they\\'ve built up the network, that\\'s when the norm the more normal non-enthusiast people will come around. So there\\'s like dot dot dot in between those two steps that I haven\\'t quite figured out. But a great question to ask when someone\\'s pitching you some Web3 alternative to an existing app or platform or network is, why are people going to want to use this? And maybe the answer as they would is, it\\'s because of the tokens. It\\'s because we\\'re going to be paying you. The value incentives are all going to be aligned and everybody\\'s going to want to join and build up the value of the token. And that\\'s what\\'s going to draw people in. Maybe that\\'ll happen in some cases, but that\\'s the right question to ask. MC: And it might be a situation where like we\\'re seeing with cryptocurrency now, where you have a few crypto coins that are very valuable. And then there\\'s like a bazillion people out there who are trying to get you to buy their coin, because they want to build the value of their coin. And it\\'s like, which one do you buy into? Do you buy into Tiddlywink, or do you buy into Ethereum or Bitcoin, or one of the ones that holds real value in The world? GE: Totally. And if we extend that line of thinking, let\\'s say that each of the three of us starts our own Web3 social network. And we each have this token-based business model. You could imagine the same winner take all effects that exist in Web2 you to apply to Web3, where one of our tokens is going to start to build value. That\\'s going to be the winner. That\\'s going to be the network everybody wants to get on. And maybe Web3 will just have the Web3 version of Facebook, the dominant social media, the dominant social network, because it might not be possible for all these different token based business models to succeed at the same time. MC: Yeah. LG: So on the one hand here at WEIRD, we tend to be cautious optimist and keeping an eye towards the future. But I\\'m fascinated by these relatively new attempts by technologists to codify what\\'s been emerging for years now, right? what\\'s in a name? blockchain\\'s been around forever. Forever, several years at this point. Non-fungible tokens. The idea of that is not necessarily new. The metaverse. For a while, was VR and AR. And then a few years ago it became XR. And now it\\'s the metaverse. So like on the one hand, humans often feel the need to label or name things. So maybe that\\'s not all that unusual. And sometimes by naming or creating structure around something, we can bring them into existence. But I can\\'t help, but be a little bit skeptical that by creating names around these technologies, it\\'s basically part of a land grab for this next version of the web. And what it\\'s going to lead to is just more capital because it enables companies to go to Sand Hill Road and their startups and say, \"I\\'m a Web3 company, I\\'m a metaverse company.\" And we certainly see that in our inboxes here at WIRED too, GE: Naming something is very powerful. And you\\'re right to be skeptical. I mean, I think it\\'s fair to say that the people who deserve the most credit or blame for popularizing the Web3 term are the venture capitalists at Andreessen Horowitz, they\\'re crypto funds specifically. It\\'s been reported in a lot of places that they\\'re making a big lobbying push on Washington to make sure that regulations and laws that are passed don\\'t imperil their crypto holdings and investments. And they\\'re very bullish on this Web3 notion. So these are money people, right? They think that they can make money. They think there\\'s money to be made here. But at the same time, I think that the reason that it\\'s kind of catching on is that... And the reason that other buzzwords are kind catching on lately, like the metaverse, is that people are kind of sick of the status quo. I think that things feel a little bit stuck right now and we\\'re we\\'re getting tired of using the same interfaces that are actually getting worse. Shopping for stuff on it, finding what you want on Amazon has gotten harder. Finding the right results on Google has, in many ways, gotten harder because they\\'ve rolled up so much of the economy that they don\\'t have to try as hard to be good. And so people are kind of sick of that. And the idea of something new, a new way to interact, genuinely exciting technological development is, well, it\\'s genuinely exciting. And when you put a name on that, it helps people imagine, it ties together things that otherwise might seem disparate and gives people something to get excited about. The question is, are we going to get something genuinely cool? Or is it just the money guys who are going to get the return on investment? MC: Just the money guys. It\\'s always just the money guys. Sorry. LG: I was just going to say something eloquent, like, \"Well, we probably can\\'t answer that in this podcast,\" but Mike just answered it for us. So thank you, Mike. MC: You\\'re welcome. LG: All right. Gilad, thank you so much for trying to unpack all of this complicated Web3 lingo. I think we\\'re going to have to have you back on in the future to unpack it a little bit more. But let\\'s take a break and then we\\'re going to come back with recommendations. All right. Gilad, as our guest of honor and resident blockchain Web3 expert, what is your recommendation? GE: OK. I\\'ve got two recommendations this week. The first one is, sticking on the blockchain theme, the book,Digital Gold, by theNew York Timesreporter Nathaniel Popper. I recently read and it\\'s very good. So it was published in 2015. So it\\'s not going to bring you up to speed. No one was talking about, well, almost no one was talking about Web3 back then. But, it\\'s a really good introduction, very detailed history of Bitcoin and by extension blockchain. And the author is a very good, clear explainer of difficult concepts. So if anybody out there doesn\\'t really know where to begin, I do recommend that book. MC:Digital Gold? GE:Digital Gold. And then my other recommendation, when perhaps I\\'m stealing this from one of you guys is our producer Boone Ashworth has a fantastic feature on WIRED.com right now, The Twitter Wildfire Watcher Who Tracks California\\'s Blazes. It\\'s really masterfully done by our friend Boone. It\\'s about a guy who, I don\\'t want to give too much away, but it\\'s about the most popular and helpful Twitter account that warns people in California, when and whether to evacuate because of wildfires. And it\\'s run by a guy all the way in New Zealand, oddly enough. And Boone just goes into a lot of fascinating detail about this man and his story and how he got into this and the nuts and bolts of how he does it and the impact that has. So highly, highly recommend that. MC: So let me just say Gilad, you lovely bastard. You did in fact, steal my recommendation. I was going to recommend that everybody read Boone\\'s story. Because Boone is our producer, he sits here either on Zoom or in the room with us every week and does this show. But he is also a fantastic writer, as you mentioned. And yeah, it\\'s a lovely story. It\\'s a feature. So it\\'s long. And it has beautiful photographs. And it also talks about sort of the breakdown that happens when people are craving real time information and the emergency services are too busy dealing with the emergency to provide real time information and how that creates a vacuum that is filled by all of these volunteers. GE: Yeah. There\\'s really interesting dynamics in there. But I kind of want to pump the brakes because I\\'m worried that we\\'re laying it on tooth thick at this point. MC: Yes. GE: Because Boone, what are we going to do if he gets too big for this podcast? MC: I mean, he already is, but he insists on doing it. I\\'ve tried to get rid of him. GE: Ah, I See. OK. So we\\'re trying to inflate him so that he floats away. MC: I think so. GE: OK. MC: Anyway. Yeah, big round of applause for Boone. This is your first big feature story for WIRED after working here a couple years and writing a lot of really great stories and editing a lot of really great podcasts. But this is a big one and it\\'s great. Everybody should read it. GE: The Twitter Wildfire Watcher Who Tracks California\\'s Blazes. Boone Ashworth: Thanks guys. MC: OK, Laura, now can you see something really mean about Boone. GE: OK. Just to balance it out. LG: So I was going to recommend this story that\\'s on WIRED.com today. It\\'s titled, The Twitter Wildfire Watcher Who Tracks California\\'s Blazes. GE: Never heard of it. LG: It\\'s by this guy named Boone Ashworth. He also happens to be our podcast producer. Am I being redundant at all? GE: Tell me more. MC: No, this is how the blockchain works. LG: This is how ... Oh, OK. MC: All three of us have to have- GE: That\\'s very good. LG: Are we all getting paid in tokens for this. MC: Yes. LG: Boonecoin. MC: Boonecoin. LG: Boonecoin. Oh my God. That\\'s amazing. MC: Yeah. LG: Oh, and so when people, when they ask you how much your Boonecoin is worth, they\\'re going to say, \"How much is Ash worth?\" MC: \"How much is Ash worth?\" GE: Yes. LG: Uh-huh. Or you can just call it Ashcoin because then it\\'s like, how much is your Ash worth? MC: How many people do you think are still listening at this point? BA: I quit. MC: OK. Really, what\\'s your recommendation? LG: OK, my recommendation this week is going to be a borrowed recommendation from another week. Mike, you had recommendedBroad Citya while back, and you kept telling me, you need to watch it. It\\'s not a new show. It started in 2014. It ran through 2019. I finally started watching it. It is hilarious. Now basically in the evenings, I wonder how is too late to text Mike and say, just an FYI, I\\'m crying laughing right now, watching Broad City. It\\'s so deeply weird and funny. And the two women who write the show and star in the show are so talented and I\\'m loving it. MC: Well, never too late to text me. I just reserve the right to wait until 6:00 am when I wake up to respond. LG: OK. Yeah. Pretty much. My signal last night to Mike was I wasn\\'t that late, but I was like, oh my God, I\\'m at the seafood episode. Oh, it\\'s so good. GE: And are you, are you more of an Abbi person or an Ilana person? LG: This is an important question. I feel like, oh God, I don\\'t know. So I lived in New York in my 20s and I\\'m trying to think of like, for a long time, pretty much the whole decade. And I\\'m trying to think of who I was probably more like, and I was probably a little bit more of an Abbi. Yeah. MC: Obviously. GE: Yas, queen. LG: Yes. I too worked at a gym and aspire to be a spin instructor. No, I didn\\'t really, but I don\\'t know, it\\'d be fun to be a spin instructor. MC: Oh my God. GE: That\\'s not the message of the show. LG: No, I know. It\\'s not at all. No, strike that. OK. MC: It\\'s also very rewatchable. LG: You mean it seems that way. MC: When you get to the end, you wait a year and then go back and re-watch it. LG: Also, it\\'s like many shows, a nice snapshot of our lives, pre-pandemic. MC: Yeah. LG: They\\'re on the subway or they\\'re in clubs or doing whatever they\\'re doing. And I\\'m like, \"Oh, they end up in the hospital together one night, the seafood episode.\" And, and I\\'m like, \"Oh, they\\'re no masks. Everyone\\'s just all crowded and on top of each other.\" GE: To be fair, most television shows are like that. MC: Yeah. LG: I know. I know. MC: Yep. LG: All right. I think we\\'re going to end it. And by the way, did I mention our producer Boone wrote a great story this week on WIRED.com? GE: What\\'s it about? LG: It\\'s about wildfires MC: And the people who tweet about them LG: And the people who tweet about them. And one man in particular, who lives in New Zealand. You guys should really all go read. GE: This does not ring a bell. LG: OK. I\\'ll send it to you. GE: Cool. LG: Via Slack. GE: Put it on the blockchain, please. LG: All right. That\\'s our show. Gilad- GE: Bye. LG: Thank you. Bye. Thank you for joining us. GE: My pleasure. LG: Thank you, Mike as always, for being a great, co-host. MC: Just, same to you. LG: And thanks for recommending Broad City a while ago. MC: You\\'re welcome. LG: So I could recommend it again. MC: Glad you like it. LG: All right. Thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter, just check the show notes. Also, you can leave us a review in Apple Podcast. I love reading this. This show is produced by this guy named Boone Ashworth, who also wrote a story on wire.com this week. GE: Oh my God. Did he? LG: He did. Goodbye. BA: You guys are lunatics.
