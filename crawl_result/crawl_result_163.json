    "news_content": "Share Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cardano could lose support to Propichain as the new altcoin is gaining investor attention for its AI and Metaverse features. Table of Contents Cardano (ADA) has increased slowly over the past month despite rising bullish sentiments, causing doubts among ADA holders. New tokens with high return potential might be the best bet for Q4 2024. This has pushed investors to Propichain’s RWA altcoin. PCHAIN is also catching mass attention with its upcoming 800% increase. Yet, can this altcoin outshine Cardano (ADA)? Keep reading to see what experts think. The crypto market has returned to a bullish season as Bitcoin rose to $68,000. Yet, many Cardano holders are divided over how much Bitcoin’s increase will impactADA’s price. ADA,currently trading at $0.354, has risen by 1.96% in the past month, which is quite low compared to many altcoins. With a $12.38 billion market capitalization, Cardano is the 11th largest cryptocurrency. Many analysts say Cardano’s slow growth might be due to rising competition from Ethereum. One positive effect of Ethereum’s recent upgrade is reduced gas fees. In August, Ethereum’s gas fees hit an all-time low, causing a surge of developers to move to the network. Analysts say this could hamper Cardano’s network activity as developers head to rivals. Cardano has also launched its Chang upgrade. This upgrade introduced on-chain governance features to the Cardano ecosystem, empowering ADA holders to shape its network development. However, analysts do not see a major price rally for Cardano before the end of the year. The best predictions indicate a return to $4.03 by mid-January 2025. Propichain (PCHAIN)is a real estate marvel that combines the finest web3 technologies to provide a unique investment platform focused on the real estate sector. This platform is dedicated to helping investors seize emerging opportunities within the real estate sector, not minding their level of expertise. One key feature that assists investors in reaching this goal is Propichain’s artificial intelligence services, which continuously scour the market, finding the best profit opportunities for investors. The service also features an NFT-powered investing experience. Propichain converts these assets into fractional NFTs when purchasing homes. These NFTs ease investing while reducing the capital barriers to participate in the real estate sector. Propichain stands out as a DeFi platform. Its holders can access loan facilities from lending protocols using these fractionalized NFTs as collateral. Access to its virtual reality services is another perk of using the Propichain ecosystem. Traditional real estate investing requires buyers to view properties before completing purchases. For buyers in faraway locations, such viewing might not take place. However, Propichain solves this problem by introducing virtual reality home viewing. This eliminates the geographical barrier to investing in real estate assets. Thanks to Propichain’s (PCHAIN) virtual staging and interactive environments, users can gain a deeper understanding of property features and layouts. Finally, Propichain provides AI-powered assistance to all its users. It features chatbots offering personalized services designed to help beginners and experts overcome confusion. These chatbots can answer personalized questions, prepare vital documents, or even explain complex legal requirements. Such services make Propichain a go-to platform for individuals seeking exposure to the $300 trillion real estate sector. Analysts agree that Propichain unearths real estate investing opportunities like never before. This has increased market excitement around its ongoing presale. PCHAIN is in stage one, currently trading at $0.004. However, it is expected to get listed at $0.032, representing an 800% increase for early investors. PCHAIN’s value could also jump by over 5000x in 2025, according to experts who claim it outshines many AI tokens in the market. Many Cardano investors are already securing their stake in Propichain’s ecosystem ahead of its 800% post-listing increase.
