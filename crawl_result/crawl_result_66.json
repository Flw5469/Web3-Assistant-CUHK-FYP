    "news_title": "Coinbase CEO Says No Slowdown Post Election, Reveals 2026 Pro-Crypto Efforts",
    "news_content": "SIRWIN Bets.io Ybets TRENDING TODAY Highlights Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, announced that Coinbase would not scale back on its crypto advocacy following the U.S. election results, which are expected in six days. Armstrong’s statement emphasized that they are committed to securing a favorable environment for crypto in U.S. legislation post-November US election. Consequently, Coinbase has pledged an additional $25 million to support the pro-crypto super PAC, Fairshake PAC to back crypto-friendly candidates leading into the 2026 midterm elections. In a recent post on X, Brian Armstrong stated that Coinbase remains steadfast in its advocacy for crypto legislation. Despite the outcome of the U.S. election, Coinbase CEO emphasized that the firm would continue its pro-crypto efforts, highlighting a new $25 million commitment to Fairshake PAC, a super PAC that supports crypto-friendly candidates. The donation will boost crypto representation in Congress during the 2026 midterm elections and improve the crypto regulatory environment in the U.S. Fairshake PAC, known for its advocacy through digital and broadcast platforms, has previously utilized industry contributions to back candidates who support innovation and growth in the crypto space. Josh Vlasto, Fairshake spokesman added, “We look forward to continuing to build a long-term sustainable crypto coalition that will pass responsible regulation to protect consumers and ensure the United States continues to lead the way in technological innovation, growth, and jobs.” This latest initiative adds to Coinbase’s cumulative $75 million in political spending this cycle. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also mentioned their support for its affiliate advocacy group, Stand with Crypto (SWC), which aims to increase its membership to 4 million by 2026. The group’s mission is to engage more crypto-friendly voters, educate them on policy issues, and mobilize them in key swing states. Currently, the group has registered over 100,000 new voters across states where crypto regulation remains a pressing issue. The crypto community has continued to gain traction as a voting bloc, with nearly 1 in 5 Americans reportedly owning some form of digital asset. With this sustained momentum, Coinbase CEO aims to solidify the crypto vote as a key component of U.S. politics. More so,  Brian Armstrong  emphasized, “The crypto voter is already a force to be reckoned with, but it will continue to grow.“ In its recent Q3 earnings report,Coinbase notedlower-than-expected results due to decreased trading volumes, which led to a 27% decline in transaction fees. Revenue for the quarter fell below analyst expectations, attributed to ongoing market challenges. Despite this, Coinbase continues to diversify its offerings, with growth in staking, USDC transactions, and custody services contributing to a more resilient revenue stream. Moreover, the digital asset platformrecentlypartnered with Visa, allowing Visa debit card holders to instantly deposit funds into their accounts. This collaboration will provide users with 24/7 access to trading.
