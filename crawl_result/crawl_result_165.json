    "news_content": "SPONSORED POST* This bull market could seeRollblock’s RBLKsurpass Cardano and Polygon. The last 30 days have seen ADA drop over 16% amid increasing hype about a possible bull market. Polygon’s POL is also on a decline despite 80% of its community forecasting a bull market. Rollblock’s online casino on the other hand is surging with increased investor interest, raising nearly $5 million. Rollblock’s presale is now in its 7th stage, and investors holding RBLK are enjoying a218%on RBLK from a presale entry price of $0.01. RBLK could surge another 100x on launch day. Summary RBLK holders are laughing all the way to the bank thanks toRollblock’s presale, which has generated overwhelming support from investors. So far, early bird investors have raised over $4.7 million in support of Rollblock’s upcoming GambleFi protocol. This uptick in interest from investors has seen RBLK’s price surge over200%from its presale entry price of $0.01 to its current exchange rate of $0.032. With Rollblock’s online casino, players are given extra perks such as playing provably fair games thanks to Rollblock’s integration of blockchain transparency. What’s more, the platform features a revenue sharing model where RBLK holders get a percentage of the casino’s weekly revenue. Most importantly, however, is that Rollblock prioritizes security as its infrastructure is built on the latest security protocols. Analysts are anticipating a bull market for RBLK with a100xsurge on launch day. ADA is down 89% from its all-time high of $3.09 in 2021. Over the past month, the crypto bull market has begun, but ADA has dipped 12.7%, adding to a two-week decline of nearly 4%, with some days registering drops as sharp as 3%. ADA’s downward trend has many investors questioning its resilience. Amid mixed market sentiment, ADA holders are wary, seeking confirmation before reinvesting in thecrypto’spotential rebound Cardano’s price is experiencing a bearish trend even though 87% of ADA holders are anticipating an uptick. Granted, ADA has established critical support at its current price range of $0.33 to $0.35. However, with ADA’s price below $0.5, investors are choosing to wait for a confirmation of ADA’s ascent. If ADA falls below critical support zones at around $0.32, analysts anticipate further downsides for ADA in the long term. Polygon’s recent move from its MATIC token to POL sparked hype with the announcement of a new fee-earning model. However, while most POL holders anticipated a rebound from Polygon’s devastating drop of over 74% from its peak, its price failed to register a significant bullish resurgence. Despite positive developments, POL’s price has suffered, leaving holders anxious. As dips persist, Polygon’s community is cautiously optimistic yet remains concerned about the token’s near-term stability. So far, POL’s price has dipped 25.4% over the last 30 days with a sustained downturn that has seen POL shed nearly 7% of its value on some days. Analysts are optimistic that POL could still rebound in the near future thanks to its improved utility. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!
