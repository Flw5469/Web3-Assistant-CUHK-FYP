Updated: October 30, 2024 @ 8:48 pm   Danielle Snyder takes a break from leading the tour in the Delta 360 Sky Club at Crypto Arena in DTLA. Crypto.comArena’s 25th anniversary is coming with much more than just silver. The expansive Downtown venue has completed the third phase of a multimillion-dollar renovation project to overhaul how all fans experience their favorite events. The revamping comes just ahead of the 2024-25 NBA and NHL seasons, as well as major happenings such as the 2025 Grammy Awards and men’s and women’s gymnastics competitions in the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. “We replaced almost a million square feet of flooring, renovated every restroom and upgraded every place in this building,” said Danielle Snyder, senior vice president of Arena Services. The reimagining extends to every arena corner, from outside on Chick Hearn Court to inside VIP lounges. A memorial to Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, was installed outside the arena’s Kobe Bryant Entrance to pay tribute to one of Los Angeles’s most beloved star players. The statue celebrates his place as a city and world legend while also standing as a touching memorial to his daughter. It reflects a courtside moment between the two of them, and the inscription features his proud title of “Girl Dad.” Upon entrance, guests will be scanned by the new security screening technology partner of the arena, Evolv Technology. The Evolv Express screening system uses artificial intelligence to detect threats and streamline entry. Additional technological enhancements can be found in the merchandise stores and some grab-and-go concession stands. Merch pickup has been streamlined with RFID — fans just fill a bag with a Sparks hat, Kings jersey, Taylor Swift CD or Lakers keychain and pay at a small self-checkout kiosk. In addition, Amazon’s “Just Walk Out” technology has been implemented at two locations for shorter lines and faster service, so attendees can get back to the event faster. The City View Terrace is new to guests, which features a breathtaking look at the iconic Los Angeles skyline. The indoor-outdoor terrace houses Chef David Chang’s spicy fried chicken spot, stylized as “fuku,” a bar and plenty of space to take in the sights. Other modernization aspects include the Mamava Lactation Pods and KultureCity Sensory Pods. These inclusive spaces allow guests with breastfeeding or sensory needs to take a break from a crowded or overwhelming situation to ensure their needs are met. The arena has also overhauled its food selection to include a sweeping array of bites and meals, including two new concepts from Ludo Lefebvre of Petit Trois, David Chang’s fuku, Fresh Brothers Pizza, Big Mozz and Better Balance. Better Balance is a new arena partner that will serve vegan, plant-based or dairy-free options for guests with dietary restrictions or preferences. Senior Executive Chef John Anderson said that the plant-based options have increased in both quantity and quality, and will be integrated into meal options at various concession stands. The star player, however, is the Doritos After Dark restaurant, which serves unique, almost hard-to-believe menu items that each feature a Doritos component. Offerings range across classic Doritos flavors with experimental twists. There’s a novelty for everyone, from the Spicy Sweet Chili Ramen-rito to the Nacho Cheese Michelada. If guests are shooting for something classically Doritos, look for the Flamin’ Hot Nacho Veggie Dumplings or Flamin’ Hot Cool Ranch Cali Roll, and finish up with a Nacho Cheese Crunchtastic Vanilla Cone or Flamin’ Hot Limón Churros. “If you’re a foodie, you’re a foodie,” PepsiCo Research Chef Wiley E. Bates III said. “You don’t mind getting a little messy.” In addition to the reimagining,Crypto.comArena will be opening VIP tours hosted by expert guides, so superfans, residents and tourists will be able to experience the space without a crowd. The tours will run on non-event days and feature spaces like an artist dressing room, VIP areas and viewings of championship banners. Fans can look forward to “walking the same hallways as giants like Kobe Bryant,” Snyder said. This year, the arena began both compost and reusable programs as sustainability initiatives. “We wanted to make sure that we are doing our best to be a great sustainable partner to our guests, our fans, our artists and ultimately to the planet,” Snyder said. “One of the things we launched this year was a partnership with r.World, and they brought us a reusable cup. “Now, beverages come in a reusable plastic cup that is very durable and sanitized off-site to get reused again.” Never miss an issue.
