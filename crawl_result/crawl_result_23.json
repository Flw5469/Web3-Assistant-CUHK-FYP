    "news_content": "Diving into the world of cryptocurrency exchanges can feel like navigating a maze. Yet, it’s a crucial gateway that opens up endless possibilities for your digital asset journey. With the right platform, you’ll have the power to execute any transaction you desire, from basic trading to complex operations. When traditional investments are thought of, there can be many that will initially be thought of. This has happened because of their place in history. It was at the end of 2021 that games with prizes in digital assets (tokens) became a fever. A new segment emerged, called play-to-earn, where users were rewarded according to their performance in these crypto games. The world’s largest cryptocurrency, with a market of over $1 trillion, Bitcoin has become a favorite asset of both retail and institutions alike seeking to preserve their wealth in the most secure and economically sound asset in human existence. Now, Bitcoin is stepping into an even more intriguing and rewarding phase. Mr. Buzz, a partner at V3V Ventures, is taking the lead in growing investments within the TON/Telegram ecosystem. Building on V3V’s prior investments in Toncoin, the native currency of the TON blockchain, Mr. Buzz has now turned his focus to investing in Telegram usernames and channels. Xlence is gaining recognition in the world of forex and CFD trading, offering a broad range of features that cater to both beginner and professional traders. In this Xlence review, we’ll walk you through seven key things you should know before choosing Xlence as your broker. This guide will help you weigh the benefits and understand some areas for potential improvement.

Bitcoin, priced at $68,386 today, has come a long way from its humble beginnings. Launched in 2009 by an enigmatic figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin introduced a new era of digital currency and decentralized finance. Initially dismissed by the mainstream financial world, Bitcoin has since carved out a legitimate space in global markets, emerging as a favored asset for those seeking diversification beyond traditional investments. Popular utility meme coin SquidGrow gearing up to launch its privacy-focused DEX aggregator SilentSwap amidst the growing adoption of the crypto sector. The investment landscape offers a plethora of options, but few assets have garnered as much attention as Bitcoin (BTC), the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX), and gold (XAU). Each represents a different class—cryptocurrency, equities, and commodities, respectively—and offers unique opportunities and risks. This article delves into their historical performance, volatility, correlations, and future price projections to provide a comprehensive comparison. The history of finance started in ancient times when farmers and tribespeople bartered goods caught on the hunt or grown in their fields. Soon after, whether shells or precious metals, ancient peoples improved their trade through more durable and widely accepted currencies than sheep or wheat. For centuries after, all trade happened directly between two parties, one peer to another. Staking cryptocurrency is one of the best ways to grow your digital assets. In 2024 staking platforms offer a lot of rewards and choosing the right crypto staking platform is key to maximizing your earnings. Among the top ones is STAKING AI, a platform that offers high returns and industry-leading technology. ChainGPT Labs proudly announces the addition of Datai Network to its prestigious incubation program. Crypto cards like the Bybit Card have become a popular way for people to spend their cryptocurrency. Still, recent regulatory crackdowns on exchanges are raising concerns. Currently, trading has become very popular, attracting the attention of individuals worldwide. Trading is no longer correlated only with financial experts or the rich and influential but with anyone interested in making considerable profits. But why did this change in perception occur? Well, now the world is dealing with currency devaluations and inflationary pressures, so people want something to secure themselves against the future’s uncertainty. Luckily, the investment landscape can help with this. Ethereum meme coin NEIRO, also known as “First Neiro On Ethereum”, is pumping, breaking into the top 100 tokens by market cap after hitting new all-time highs over the weekend.

These bots are transforming how people invest in crypto by using advanced algorithms and automation to trade more efficiently and profitably. For many, AI trading bots have made crypto investing simpler, more accessible, and less time-consuming. The possibility of passive income from cryptocurrencies keeps attracting more and more users in 2024, trying to figure out the ways of reaping benefits from digital assets. Among many options, crypto staking is one of the most popular options: this feature allows investors to lock their tokens and reward them, respectively.

Staking has become one of the most preferred ways for crypto investors to get some passive income. In this article, we will review the Top 8 Staking Platforms of 2024 as mentioned below.

    "news_title": "US Treasury Department Releases 132-Page Report on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies – Here’s What You Need to Know in a Summary",
    "news_content": "The U.S. Treasury Department has identified an increased demand for short-term government bonds linked to the rise of stablecoins, according to a newly published 132-page report. Prepared for the Treasury's Borrowing Advisory Committee, the report examines the impact of digital assets such as Bitcoin and stablecoins on the broader financial landscape. In the report, the Treasury noted that “growth in stablecoins has led to a modest increase in demand for short-term Treasury securities.” It acknowledged that the digital asset market, while still relatively small compared to traditional assets, has grown significantly in recent years. “Digital assets have witnessed rapid growth from a small base,” the Treasury Department said, noting that while this growth has not yet replaced demand for Treasury securities, it has affected the market in other ways. A notable example of this trend is Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap. Tether reportedly holds a significant portion of its reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds, with CEO Paolo Ardoino claiming the company owns more Treasury bonds than countries like the United Arab Emirates, Australia, and Spain. According to Treasury estimates, there is currently around $120 billion worth of stablecoin collateral invested in Treasurys, with Tether accounting for $81 billion of that total. As of now, the entire stablecoin market is valued at over $177 billion. Stablecoins play a crucial role in the digital asset ecosystem, mediating over 80% of all crypto transactions. Their stable value compared to other volatile crypto assets has made them a popular choice for traders looking for a reliable intermediary currency. Despite the positive impact stablecoins have had on the Treasury market, the report also pointed to potential challenges on the horizon. The Treasury Department noted that the future of stablecoins will largely depend on regulatory and policy decisions in the coming years. “Medium-term regulatory and policy choices will determine the fate of this ‘private currency,’” the report warned, noting the historical risks of privately issued currencies failing to meet certain standards. Touching on Bitcoin alongside stablecoins, the report noted that structural demand for Treasury bonds could increase as the digital asset market continues to grow. Bitcoin could potentially act as a hedge against price volatility and an “on-chain” safe-haven asset, further connecting the crypto market to traditional financial instruments. *This is not investment advice.

    "news_title": "Major Chainlink (LINK) Upgrade Goes Live, Price Reacts",
    "news_content": "Chainlink is evolving rapidly, with a major Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) upgrade now live on the mainnet. The decentralized Oracle service said this CCIP v1.5 upgrade has the power to transform how connected protocols share data. Chainlink named four unique enhancements that went live alongside the upgrade. Per the Oracle protocol, CCIP now has its own tailor-made CCT standard. With this, the CCIP can enable cross-chain native tokens featuring self-service deployments, full control and ownership, enhanced programmability and zero-slippage transfers. Introducing the CCIP v1.5 upgrade.🪙 Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard💻 Self-serve token onboarding🏗️ CCIP SDK & Token Manager🛡️ Security & privacy enhancementsHere's why #Chainlink CCIP is the #1 choice for building cross-chain 🧵⬇️https://t.co/mO24Gp1jr9 The upgrade also introduces a unique simplicity that makes developers adjust to the new changes without a hassle. Chainlink is a dynamic digital currency that is constantly evolving. Beyond the latest update, the protocol has entered the list of the most active protocols in the industry. With Oracle powering the majority of smart contracts in Web3, its relevance is notably not overblown. As part of the new CCIP v1.5 upgrade, it has launched the Token Developer Attestation, which it said is in private beta. This product will help developers to double-check their work to guarantee precision. With this, they can even attest to token burn events before the assets are minted, encouraging trust across the board. Following this update and the broader trend in the digital currency ecosystem, the LINK price has maintained a mildly resilient outlook. As of writing time, LINK price is up by 4.92% in 24 hours to $12.05. Riding on the general outlook of the market that has sent the price of Bitcoin (BTC) up, the token has pared off the losses of the past week and is now changing hands for 5.96%. Now, it remains unknown whether or not the price of LINK is reacting to the upgrade or the broader hype in the market. In all, the upgrade is poised to drive enhanced usability, which may in turn fuel growth in the price of LINK. Send us a link to a similar news story on another source.

    "news_title": "Fetch.ai partners with Alibaba Cloud to strengthen its decentralized AI network",
    "news_content": "Fetch.ai, a Cambridge-based artificial intelligence company and member of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, has integrated Alibaba Group’s cloud computing subsidiary Alibaba Cloud as a cloud provider. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is a merger of SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, and Fetch.ai, with the token trading under the FET symbol. The companies announced the partnership via a press release on Oct. 30, with Fetch.ai noting that the collaboration is one more step towards bringing web2 to web3. Fetch.ai will tap into Alibaba Cloud’s infrastructure to bolster its decentralized AI network through Cloudician, Alibaba Cloud’s web3 partner in the Asia Pacific region. In this case, the cloud provider will help verify and validate transactions on the Fetch.ai network, boosting both accuracy and security for users. The deal is also good for Fetch.ai, in that it allows it to tap into Alibaba’s high-performance and robust cloud computing infrastructure and global network. With a superior bandwidth and global footprint, using Alibaba Cloud means cross-region deployment of decentralized applications, low latency, and high security among key benefits. “This collaboration reinforces our commitment to developing a secure network infrastructure, safeguarding data assets and ensuring business continuity globally,” Humayun Sheikh, chief executive officer of Fetch.ai and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance chairman, said. “We see immense potential in collaborating with Alibaba Cloud to push the boundaries of decentralized AI technologies. Their expertise and innovation in AI will be invaluable in our pursuit of advancing possibilities in the Web3 industry.” While this is the beginning of what’s expected to be a long-term relationship between ASI and Alibaba Cloud, it’s not the cloud computing provider’s first in the crypto industry. In March this year, the decentralized infrastructure network (DePIN) platform AIOZ Network partnered with Alibaba Cloud to advance DePIN adoption in Southeast Asia. The Singapore-based blockchain network was to use Alibaba Cloud’s cloud solution to expand its presence in the region. AIOZ Network also leveraged the partnership to bolster its infrastructure, which includes web3 AI, storage, and streaming. The Aptos Foundation on the other hand joined forces with Alibaba Cloud in June 2024, revealing a collaboration aimed at strengthening Japan’s blockchain ecosystem. Aptos targets further adoption with users benefiting from web3 and digital assets growth. Another major integration is blockchain security firm CertiK’s announcement in July. The blockchain company migrated its cloud infrastructure to Alibaba Cloud, with the partnership seen as key to CertiK’s quest to expand in Asia. Other blockchain networks and platforms to partner with Alibaba Cloud include Conflux Network, Avalanche, NEAR, and Sui.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin is just 2% away from breaking its all-time high",
    "news_content": "At the tail end of a month that saw numerous false breakouts, Bitcoin (BTC) has finally surged above the psychologically important $70,000 level — for the first time since June. The pioneering cryptocurrency is trading at $71,850 at the time of publication — having rallied by 102.45% compared to this time last year. Several key technical indicators are suggesting that this could be the start of a prolonged rally. With just two days left to go, it’s beginning to look like ‘Uptober’ could end on an even higher note.  Bitcoin has been struggling to decisively break through the $70,000 price point for almost six months at the time of writing. This latest move to the upside will almost certainly reignite the confidence of traders and investors — BTC has seen 15 green days over the course of the last month, and this latest breakthrough comes at a price point that is near both the all-time high and the cycle high. In fact, the leading digital asset has managed to not only outperform its closest comparison, Ethereum (ETH) — it has also outperformed 59% of the top 100 crypto assets when looking at a 1-year chart. Institutional adoption has also been a key factor that has enabled this surge — with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT) going a long way in making BTC more accessible to regular retail investors and securing higher liquidity through inflows. This could prove to be a significant catalyst going forward — VanEck, one of the most notable institutional investors, sees the cryptocurrency becoming a global reserve asset that could reach prices as high as $3 million by 2050. While there are plenty of reasons for optimism, readers should note that that is, in turn, no reason to abandon proper risk management. At press time, a key technical indicator, the relative strength index (RSI), is at 70 — signaling that the asset has entered overbought territory. This does not mean that a correction or retracement will follow — however, as pointed out by crypto expert Alan Santana, additional confirmation is needed before the veracity of the bull run can be determined. To boot, testing both cycle highs and all-time highs is a tall order — and before that happens, traders should keep an eye out for a resistance level at $72,625.90 and a support level at $69,307.20, as identified by Finbold. Should Bitcoin surpass that level of resistance, the all-time high at $73,750 will remain as the final obstacle that will confirm or deny a prolonged upswing.Featured Image:ViewFinder nilsophon— December 25, 2019.

    "news_content": "The Swell conference, Ripple’s annual gathering, has become a pivotal event in the blockchain industry, attracting industry leaders, regulators, and Ripple’s global partners. Held in Miami, Swell 2024 showcased the latest developments in digital finance, including themes around crypto regulation, stablecoins, and the integration of artificial intelligence in financial services. One of Swell’s hallmark traditions is the unveiling of Ripple’s product roadmap—a moment eagerly anticipated by attendees each year. This year’s roadmap presentation was led by Ripple’s President, Monica Long, and Senior Vice President of Product, Aaron Slettehaugh. Together, they highlighted Ripple’s expanding product suite and its commitment to bridging traditional finance with DeFi. Long and Slettehaugh emphasized XRP’s vision to provide a “one-stop shop” for digital assets. Slettehaugh stated, “Ripple is building out this suite that will meet all the needs of our customers to be able to tokenize, store, and exchange and move their digital assets,” emphasizing the goal of creating fully integrated, efficient solutions. The discussion covered new enhancements in the XRP Ledger, advanced custody options, and the development of Ripple’s USD stablecoin (RLUSD) to drive liquidity across borders. The roadmap presentation began with an overview of the XRP Ledger, highlighting its purpose-built design for financial applications. As Slettehaugh noted, “The XRP Ledger was purpose-built for financial applications, and it has all the key components that are necessary to build a decentralized financial application.” XRP is working on an EVM-compatible sidechain with partner Axelar, which will connect the XRP Ledger to over 50 other blockchains, allowing developers to create sophisticated, interoperable applications. Under the theme of advancing XRP’s role in bridging traditional finance with DeFi, the roadmap introduced key product initiatives aimed at improving tokenization, custody, and liquidity: Swell 2024 underscored Ripple’s dedication to enhancing blockchain’s role within global finance through regulated, interoperable, and user-friendly products. As Ripple’s product roadmap unfolds, the company is poised to become a central player in bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain, building what Slettehaugh described as the “Internet of Value.” Through these innovations, Ripple continues to drive digital asset adoption across industries, connecting people, institutions, and value across borders.",

    "news_title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Hits $100,000 in Canada",
    "news_content": "The price of Bitcoin has surpassed C$100,000 for the first time, according to data provided by the Kraken exchange. The Canadian dollar recently gave up some ground against its US counterpart following a 50-basis point rate cut implemented by the Bank of Canada on Oct. 23. At press time, it is trading at 72 cents. The cryptocurrency's previous lifetime peak of $98,462 was logged back in March. The leading cryptocurrency is yet to reach a new all-time high in US dollars. Earlier today, it climbed to a new peak of $72,692 on the Bitstamp exchange. However, it is still 1.5% away from reaching a new all-time high. Bitcoin hit its current peak of $73,737 due to exuberance surrounding the success of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in early 2024.",

    "news_content": "Solayer Labs haslaunchedsUSD, the first yield-bearing stablecoin on Solana backed by US Treasury Bills. sUSD enables users to earn approximately 4% in interest, paid directly in USDC, without staking or manual processes. Using a decentralized protocol, sUSD functions as a marketplace engine, connecting USDC quotes with approved tokenizers.This fully automated protocol manages minting, redemption, and matching procedures ensuring efficient, decentralized operations for users. Through Solayer’s system, users deposit USDC, which is routed to purchase Treasury Bills, and receive sUSD in return. This setup maintains a 1:1 peg, leveraging the stability of Treasury Bills as secure short-term government debt. Due to Solana’s account model, sUSD adjusts a ‘multiplier’ on holdings to reflect interest, enabling balances to grow automatically at an annual yield of 4-5%—similar to a bank account. sUSD’s marketplace leverages OpenEden, the first tokenized RWA platform rated by Moody’s, ensuring institutional-level security and oversight. Currently backed by $150 million in liquidity, OpenEden further strengthens sUSD by allowing deposits to earn incentives on a decentralized platform. The stablecoin also serves as a Proof of Stake (PoS) collateral asset, securing Solana’s decentralized applications, including layer-two networks, bridges, and oracles. Solayer plans to expand sUSD’s backing with a basket of low-risk assets, including real-world instruments like oil and gold in future updates.",

    "news_title": "Here’s Three Reasons Why Bitcoin Futures Set Record Highs Amid Price Surge to $71K",
    "news_content": "Bitcoin futures' open interest on a one-day basis saw the biggest jump in 24 hours since June, an increase of over 20,000 BTC. Since Oct. 16, U.S listed spot ETFs have seen $2.7 billion of net inflows. Bitcoin (BTC)-tracked futures set a record high open interest (OI) in U.S. dollar terms early Tuesday as the asset broke past $71,000 for the first time since June, data shows. BTC futures recorded their biggest one-day jump since June 3 with OI jumping over 20,000 BTC, worth $2.5 billion at current prices, to reach almost 600,000 BTC, or $42.6 billion, as of Tuesday. OI refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. High open interest indicates that there is significant interest in a particular asset. When open interest increases along with rising prices, it suggests new money is coming into the market, indicating a strengthening trend - such as Tuesday’s. High open interest can lead to increased volatility, especially as contracts near expiration. Traders might rush to close, roll over, or adjust positions, which can lead to significant price movements. Research firm Kaiko said in an X post that while futures showed strong interest from traders, the funding rates for such positions remain well below March highs which indicate tempered demand. Funding rates in perpetual futures markets are periodic payments made between traders to ensure that the price of the perpetual contract remains close to the spot price of the underlying asset. Traders such as Singapore-based QCP Capital remain bullish on BTC in the near term, expecting price gains to continue in the weeks ahead. “With rising expectations around a potential Trump victory boosting both stocks and Bitcoin, we believe BTC is well-positioned for medium-term gains,” the firm wrote in a Tuesday broadcast on Telegram. Reasons why BTC OI has zoomed Contracts offered on the Chicago Mercentile Exchange (CME) have seen a 9% surge in 24 hours, taking their open interest to 171,700 BTC, worth over $12.22 billion, which gives CME a 30% dominance in the futures open interest market. As they maintain their number one spot in this market. In mid-October, bitcoin was trading around $67,000 and the OI on CME hit all-time highs in both notional open interest ($12.4 billion) which is the dollar value of the futures contracts and bitcoin denominated futures contracts (179,930 BTC), per Glassnode data. Second, the funding rate in perpetual markets has also soared in the past 24 hours to 15%, according to Coinglass data, this is one of the highest recorded levels in the past few months, which shows an extreme bias for bullish long trades. Finally, the third reason can be attributed to the strong inflows from the U.S. listed spot ETFs, which in recent weeks has seen a slight evolution from theinstitutional basis trade at the start of the year to now more bullish long directional plays. Since Oct. 16 bitcoin denominated futures contracts peaked on the CME exchange, it has since dropped by over 6%, which has been the opposite for the ETF inflows which have seen a cumulative net inflow of $2.7 billion. The charge has been led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has seen $2.2 billion of net inflows in the same time period while achieving a new record of holding over400,000 bitcoin in the ETF. Earlier in the year it was apparent that the basis trade or the cash and carry arbitrage was taking place which involves taking advantage of the price difference between the bitcoin spot and futures price. The basis trade involves taking a long position on the ETF and then taking a short position on the CME futures bitcoin price. This was one of the reasons bitcoin has been trading in a long sideways range since March, as not all the inflows from the ETFs were directionally long but overall a net neutral strategy. Checkmate, an analyst, also noted the recent divergence between the CME OI and the ETF inflows. “We have a divergence between Bitcoin ETF Inflows and CME Open Interest. ETF Inflows are ticking meaningfully higher. CME Open Interest is up, but not as much. GBTC outflows are also minimal. We're seeing true directional ETF inflows, and less so cash and carry trades,” Checkmate wrote. The recent purchase of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) by theEmory University endowment could support Checkmate's point of view to be a directional long purchase, as one would not expect a University to start executing the basis trade. Emory University would be the first endowment to purchase a bitcoin ETF and while $15 million isn’t a large sum for an institutional investor the narrative and the directional play stand out in a similar fashion to the Wisconsin Pension Fund. However, Andre Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise, takes the other side of this view: he believes due to the increase in net short-positioning and an increase in CME open interest in the past 24 hours, that the basis trade has already started to pick up, he told CoinDesk in a note. “There was an increase in net short positioning judging by the change in net non-commercial positioning on CME since early September. This coincided with an overall increase in CME open interest which implies that net there has really been an increase in cash-and-carry trades,\" he wrote in a note to CoinDesk. \"However, we only have weekly data up to 22/10 from the CFTC, so we don't have insights into the latest OI change yet”.",

    "news_title": "Satoshi’s Record At Stake: Bitcoin ETFs Could Cross 1 Million BTC Today",
    "news_content": "US Bitcoin ETFs recorded their highest daily inflow since inception, amassing $870 million on Tuesday. This surge in investment comes as the largest cryptocurrency inches closer to its all-time high of $73,700, originally reached in March. This comes as investor sentiment appears to be buoyed by speculation surrounding a potential victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump over VP Kamala Harris, which many believe could foster a more positive environment for thedigital assetecosystem, ultimately favoring crypto prices. According to Bloomberg data, Tuesday’s subscriptions pushed the year-to-date inflows for the group of 12 Bitcoin ETFs to over $23 billion. Analysts attribute the growing demand for Bitcoin exposure to Trump’s elevated odds in election betting markets. However, while Trump leads in prediction markets, polls show a tight race against Vice President Harris, who has pledged to support a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Still,Trump’s approachseems to have resonated more with the community. Adding to the speculation, Bitcoin options markets reflect a one-third chance of a price swing exceeding 10% on election day, November 5, as indicated by Nick Forster, founder of the crypto trading platform Derive.xyz. This surge would take the Bitcoin price to anew all-time highof $72,900 in the potential scenario where BTC consolidates above $72,000 for the next few days ahead of the election. Forster believes such volatility often encourages traders to position themselves for potential market movements, increasing demand for Bitcoin ETFs and contributing to the current price rally since the beginning of the week. ETF expert Eric Balchunas has also commented on the bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that these funds are on track to reach 1 million BTC in holdings as early as today. In a recent social media post, Balchunasreportedthat US spot ETFs could surpass 1 million BTC by next Wednesday, potentially surpassing the holdings of Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, by mid-December, with the funds adding approximately 17,000 BTC each week. However, following Tuesday’s performance, Balchunas remarked, “We’re going to need to move up our predictions,” highlighting that Bitcoin ETFs had gobbled up over 12,000 coins in a single day, now holding 996,000 BTC. The expert expressed optimism about the likelihood of breaching the 1 million mark today, stating that the “extraordinary”trading volumefrom the previous day is likely to translate into significant inflows. Balchunas also cautioned that market conditions can be unpredictable. “Anything can happen,” he warned, referencing the risk of a sudden selloff that could delay reaching the 1 million BTC milestone. Conversely, if Bitcoin prices continue to rise and a Trump victory boosts market enthusiasm, a fear of missing out (FOMO) could drive even more rapid accumulation, according to the expert’s analysis.  When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $72,360, up over 8% in the 7-day time frame. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

    "news_title": "Ethereum Defies Crypto Slump, While Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin Falter",
    "news_content": "Ethereum has demonstrated significant upward momentum recently, contrasting with the struggles of Bitcoin, Solana, and Dogecoin. As Ethereum’s price climbs, other major cryptocurrencies face resistance and downward trends. This divergence highlights the complex dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, which is influenced by various factors, including trading volume, market sentiment, and key support and resistance levels. Ethereum is currently priced at $2,678.67, marking a 1.23% increase over the past day. The recent price trend shows a recovery from a low of approximately $2,644, which acted as a critical support level. Source: Coinmarketcap This zone provided a foundation for buyers, demonstrating strong interest. However, Ethereum recently encountered resistance near $2,700, where selling pressure increased, preventing further gains. A decisive break above this level could trigger a move toward the next resistance at around $2,750. The 24-hour trading volume is at $23.98 billion, up 9.5%. This increase signals heightened trading activity, which could either facilitate a breakout above the $2,700 resistance or lead to a pullback if buying momentum wanes. Additionally, Ethereum’s market cap is $322.53 billion, showing continued stability in this range. However, significant catalysts are needed to drive further growth. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is facing downward pressure. The current price is $71,918.40, down 1.03% on the last day. Bitcoin recently reached a high of $73,000, where it encountered strong selling pressure. This level has emerged as a significant resistance point, while a low of approximately $71,500 serves as the immediate support. If this support is broken, it could trigger a further decline, potentially targeting lower support around $71,000. Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume has fallen to $48.72 billion, down 8.67%. This drop in trading activity might be contributing to the recent price dip. The current market cap of $1.427 trillion reflects ongoing interest, but additional volume is crucial for a potential breakout above resistance levels. Solana is currently trading at $174.11, down 4.08%. The price faces resistance near $181.60, leading to a downward trajectory. Support is tentatively around $174, with the potential for further testing around $170 if the downward trend continues. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is at $0.1658, down 6.77%. Support sits near $0.165, while resistance is at $0.1742. The recent decrease in trading volumes for both Solana and Dogecoin indicates weakened momentum, potentially prolonging their struggles.

The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,489 swing low to the $2,719 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,700 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,720. A clear move above the $2,720 resistance might send the price toward the $2,880 resistance.  An upside break above the $2,880 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone. If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start a downside correction.

    "news_title": "Tax-Free Bitcoin? Trump’s Cryptocurrency Proposal Explained",
    "news_content": "Former President Donald Trump has sparked fresh debate with his proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on American-made cryptocurrencies. Trump argues that removing taxes on U.S.-based digital assets like Bitcoin and XRP could boost their everyday use by easing tax burdens on simple transactions. This proposal has stirred up a back-and-forth on the role of digital assets in the U.S. economy, with some seeing it as a way to encourage the use of cryptocurrencies without the tax complications that often deter smaller, daily purchases. Trump believes the current tax structure around cryptocurrency transactions is unfair. He pointed out that when Americans use Bitcoin to buy everyday items—such as a cup of coffee—they face capital gains tax if the Bitcoin’s value has risen since purchase. This requirement turns routine transactions into taxable events, which he argues disincentivizes the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in everyday commerce. Trump has further suggested that Bitcoin should be treated as currency in these instances, exempting it from additional taxes. To support his case, he shared an anecdote about a friend who also believes that digital currencies should remain untaxed. Instead of taxing U.S. crypto, Trump proposes tariffs on foreign crypto assets, which would place a tax on digital assets from outside the United States, promoting domestic cryptocurrency innovation and discouraging reliance on foreign tokens. Trump’s tax proposal prioritizes American-made crypto assets like Bitcoin and XRP. Under his plan, transactions involving these U.S.-based cryptocurrencies would be tax-free, which he believes could attract more Americans to invest in and use them. The potential tax exemption would make Bitcoin and XRP more attractive compared to foreign assets such as Ethereum, which would still be taxed. In addition to favoring domestic digital assets, Trump argues that tax incentives would drive growth and innovation within the U.S. cryptocurrency sector. By reducing the tax burden on U.S. crypto, he aims to foster an environment where new digital assets can emerge, potentially making the U.S. a leader in cryptocurrency development and use.

    "news_content": "Chainlink has announced its DECO Sandbox is open to the public. This gives financial institutions and Web3 developers a hands-on environment to explore privacy-enhanced data solutions. The DECO Sandbox offers preconfigured use cases demonstrating privacy-preserving data verification methods for streamlined compliance processes and enhanced data security. The #Chainlink DECO Sandbox is now officially open to the public 🏗️The sandbox provides preconfigured use cases and a framework to empower financial institutions and Web3 developers to start innovating on compliant and privacy-preserving data solutions.https://t.co/9fGvrxy9lc The DECO Sandbox introduces a zero-knowledge Transport Layer Security (zkTLS) oracle technology, which enables financial institutions to verify critical data, such as identity and proof of funds, without exposing sensitive details. This framework empowers financial services to carry out identity checks, creditworthiness verification, and liquidity confirmations, reducing reliance on outdated manual processes and enhancing data privacy compliance. Financial institutions face increasing compliance costs due to inefficient data handling practices in identity verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. The DECO Sandbox allows institutions to conduct KYC checks while preserving client privacy and addressing regulatory requirements and operational costs. By leveraging DECO, companies can validate client data while keeping sensitive information hidden from view, helping to mitigate data exposure risks that can result in severe financial penalties. The DECO Sandbox provides tools for Web3 developers to experiment with decentralized identity solutions, enabling them to verify credentials like creditworthiness without exposing personal information. This capability is particularly relevant for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that require proof of financial standing without requiring users to share detailed account information. DECO’s zero-knowledge framework supports the generation of verifiable, time-stamped attestations, which can be stored on-chain and referenced by smart contracts to verify compliance.

    "news_title": "Here are Projected Timelines for Shiba Inu to Hit $0.0006 and $0.005",
    "news_content": "Market watchers have projected timelines for Shiba Inu to reach $0.0006 and $0.005, with varying forecasts from crypto analysts and enthusiasts. Shiba Inu has continued to struggle with four leading zeros, trading around $0.000017. Although Shiba Inu deleted a zero in February, it has been unable to make significant progress in price over the last eight months. However, this lackluster performance has not deterred the ambitions of Shiba Inu proponents, with various price forecasts for SHIB circulating in the crypto community. This article examines the popular projections for Shiba Inu to cancel more zeros and trade at $0.0006 and $0.005. At the current market price of $0.00001723, reaching $0.0006 would require a growth of 3,382% for Shiba Inu. According to analysts at prediction platform Telegaon, it would take Shiba Inu six years to achieve this growth and attain an average price of $0.0006446. Meanwhile, researchers at the Changelly crypto exchange estimate that it could take Shiba Inu at least eight years to break the $0.0006 level. However, analysts at CoinCodex suggest it might take until 2050 for Shiba Inu to reach even $0.0005. Conversely, some analysts in the crypto community disagree with these extended timelines from prominent entities. According to Davie Satoshi, a widely followed meme coin analyst, Shiba Inu could register a 30X rally this bull season, implying a price of $0.0006 by 2025. At the $0.0006 price point, Shiba Inu would command a market cap of $353.4 billion, surpassing the current valuation of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency. For Shiba Inu to cancel another zero and trade at $0.005, it would need to increase by 28,919% from its current level of $0.00001723. Notably, at this elevated price, Shiba Inu could command a market cap of approximately $3 trillion, comparable to the current valuation of Apple. According to Changelly, this threshold may be achievable for SHIB by May 2040. However, Telegaon analysts set a more immediate timeline of 2035.",

    "news_title": "HBAR Price Holds Key Support Analysts Eye $0.098",
    "news_content": "Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is trading at $0.0492, with a slight gain of 0.82%. Analysts consider $0.0450 to be important support and $0.0550-$0.0600 as a resistance level that HBAR must break to confirm an uptrend. According to Analyst best_analyst, if the price is to hold above $0.035 a bullish reversal pattern with a target price of $0.098 may occur. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for HBAR is 42.75 which still shows weak momentum just below the neutral 50 mark. This level suggests that sellers remain in control but a rise above 50 indicates a possible bullish breakout. The MACD indicator has the MACD line below the signal line, with the MACD line at -0.0009 and the signal line at -0.004. Furthermore, if the MACD line overlaps and crosses the signal line, it may affirm the beginning of a trend reversal to the advantage of the bulls. The oscillation between $0.0450 and $0.0550 shows that there is a lack of substantial movement beyond the range, a break above resistance is necessary to affirm a bullish trend. This consolidation phase reflects a mixed outlook as both RSI and MACD show no clear buying or selling pressure. Analysts stressed that it is crucial for HBAR to sustain a price above $0.0450 to avoid further losses. As per best_analysts, HBAR’s future depends on sustaining at $0.035, further weakness may lead to a deeper downfall. “HBAR is expected to stay above $0.035,” the best _analyst noted, hinting that if the price drops below the $0.035 mark, it may take long for the bear market to reverse. On the other hand, HBAR needs to have a bullish reversal above this level of support, which would indicate a strong bounce to $0.098. However, best_analyst points out that the achievement of this target has to be backed by clear confirmation signals from price action and other technical indicators. The social media community echoes a similar sentiment, with discussions highlighting HBAR’s circulating supply of over 37 billion and its unique hash graph technology. The majority view HBAR as more than just a cryptocurrency, with one X user commenting, “HBAR is redefining blockchain with speed, security, and scalability.” However, issues of increased supply and market trends remain as potential barriers. Best__analysts also use Elliott Wave Theory to determine potential HBAR price formation. The current wave structure given as corrective waves (w) (y) indicates that HBAR might be in the final stage of a corrective cycle. Wave (C) could make a bearish pattern at the lowest with a target of about 0.035. If this corrective phase comes to a successful end then HBAR could jump into an impulsive Wave (iii) upwards that may reach $0.098. The impulsive wave (iii) would be expected to follow next and correspond to the breakout above the resistance region from $0.0550 to $0.0600, which signifies an upward trend on the chart. This indicated possible bullish wave depends on the continued movement of HBAR with intermediate price levels helping in determining a change of trend. The Elliott Wave analysis clearly implies that although the upside is large, the support and resistance are key junctures for direction determination.",

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Golden Cross Confirmed, Bullish Breakout Coming?",
    "news_content": "In the past week, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been in a bullish trend with prices ranging from a high of $384 to a low of $340. The price has been mostly bullish with technical signals indicating that the price may go higher in the near future. Yet, the bearish pressure in the market in the recent past has led to some indecisiveness among traders, particularly since BCH could not breach through the $388.49 resistance level. At the time of writing, BCH is changing hands at $370 with a 3.10% drop from its highest point in the day. The price action of the recent days has also affected the market capitalization and trading volume of BCH. The BCH market capitalization has been down by 3.03% to $7.32 billion, and the 24-hour trading volume also fell by 11.50% to $391.49 million. During this period, large value transactions were observed, including a whale transfer of 69,390 BCH (about $26.57 million) between two anonymous wallets, which may be indicative of preparation for further market action. Analyzing the 4-hour chart, BCH has recently showed the Golden Cross pattern when the 50-day SMA crossed the 200-day SMA. This crossover is usually taken as a bullish signal, meaning that in the short term, the momentum is picking up compared to the long-term trend and may imply the start of an upward trend. At the moment, the 50-day SMA is still at $359.95 and the 200-day SMA is at $345.71. Post the Golden Cross, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) underwent a significant rise with the price reaching as high as $390 before a pullback. Nevertheless, this upward trend has hit the bar, with BCH unable to overcome the $388.49 mark. If the price can hold above the $365 range and stay above the 50-day SMA, it could indicate another try at breaking through the next resistance levels in the coming days. The MACD on the 4-hour chart is pointing slightly downwards, which means that the upward movement is slowing down. The MACD line is still above the signal line, which shows that buying pressure is still present, but the histogram bars have begun to diminish, which may signal a slowing down. If the MACD line crosses under the signal line, it would mean a bearish outlook and a potential retracement to previous levels of support. Also, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is at present standing at 0.09 meaning that there is weak buying pressure. While still in positive territory, a slight drop in CMF indicates that the rates of accumulation or capital inflow may have eased, which may be indicative of waning bullish pressure. In case the CMF goes into the negative territory, it would point to selling pressure and BCH may retest the lower support levels. On the daily chart, BCH is also showing a falling wedge pattern, which is generally regarded as a bullish reversal pattern. This formation is defined by two converging trendlines sloping downward, indicating a period of consolidation that often precedes a breakout to the upside. A successful breakout from this wedge pattern could propel Bitcoin Cash toward higher targets, with technical analysis suggesting a possible price target of around $750, although reaching this level would require sustained buying momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily timeframe is currently at 56.69, showing a neutral to slightly bullish stance. The RSI’s position below the overbought zone (typically above 70) indicates that BCH still has room for upward movement before hitting overbought levels. Immediate support for BCH lies around the $365 level, a point where the price previously consolidated. This level is critical for maintaining upward momentum, and the 50-day SMA at $360 serves as a dynamic support line. If BCH drops below these levels, it may test the 200-day SMA at $345, which could act as the next support area. On the upside, the recent high of $390 marks a strong resistance level. A decisive break above this point, particularly with increased trading volume, could open the path for BCH to test the psychological $400 mark.  Despite these positive developments, Bitcoin Cash Open Interest has decreased by around -6.09%, now standing at approximately $218.18 million. This decline in OI reflects a potential decrease in trader participation, possibly as they wait for clearer market direction amid the current resistance around $390. The reduction in OI might also indicate that some traders are closing positions following the recent price rally, which suggests hesitation in taking on new bullish positions at the current level.",

    "news_title": "Press release claims to reveal Satoshi on Bitcoin’s whitepaper anniversary—What we know so far",
    "news_content": "A new press release has claimed to uncover the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive inventor of Bitcoin, in a live press conference on October 31, 2024, which is also the 16th anniversary of Bitcoin’s whitepaper publication. Asstatedin the announcement, the claimed Satoshi said that mounting legal pressures have forced them to come forward to disclose their identity. The organizers promise a “live demonstration” to validate the creator’s authenticity and plan to showcase locations where “Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology were conceived.” The event announcement follows numerous unverified assertions about Satoshi’s identity since Bitcoin’s 2008 launch, such as Craig Wright. However, a UK court ruled in March thatWright is not Satoshi, citing overwhelming evidence against his assertions and indicating that he engaged in forgery to support his claims. Earlier this month, HBOannouncedit would air a documentary in a bid to reveal the identity of Satoshi. The film ended up pointing toPeter Todd, a Bitcoin core developer, as the potential Satoshi,forcing him into hidingdue to safety concerns. As a new candidate for Satoshi emerges, many in the crypto community are quick to dismiss the claim due to past experiences with unverified claims. Commenting on the recent press release, Cullen Hoback, the head behind the HBO documentary,saidthe upcoming “Satoshi Nakamoto” reveal is a hoax. It was later revealed that the organizer of the event, Charles Anderson, had close ties to Stephen Mollah, a British businessmanaccused of fraudfor allegedly claiming to be Satoshi. The allegations against him include false representations that Mollah controlled 165,000 Bitcoins, purportedly stored in Singapore. The claim was filed between November 2022 and October 2023, exposing the alleged victim, Dalmit Dohil, to significant financial losses. Dohil is prosecuting the case through private prosecution after he said Mollah misled him. Anderson’s role in this scheme remains unclear. Neither Mollah nor Anderson have pleaded guilty to any charges of fraud by false representation. Their trial is scheduled for November 3, 2025.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Makes ATH Against Euro Due To Change In Dollar Strength, Details Inside",
    "news_content": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) is yet to breach its USD all-time high (ATH) value, the flagship cryptocurrency has made a new ATH against the euro (EUR) and some other fiat currencies. Bitcoinsurpassed€68,000 ($73,561) on October 29, establishing a new ATH against the euro. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap reached this milestone on multiple crypto exchanges, including Binance. This marks the first time since March 2024 that BTC has set a new ATH against the euro. Although Bitcoin came very close to a new ATH in USD, it fell short by approximately $200, dropping from $73,620 to $71,805 at the time of writing. Notably, the discrepancy between BTC’s performance against the euro and the USD is due to changes in the dollar’s strength. On March 14, when BTC last reached its USD ATH of $73,737, the USD/EUR exchange rate was 0.9113. Currently, the rate is 0.9238, indicating a weakening euro against the dollar.  One key factor behind the dollar’s renewed strength is the US Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates to bring inflation down to its target of 2%. Bitcoin has also achieved a new ATH against the Canadian Dollar (CAD), recording a price of just over CAD 102,000, or approximately USD 73,225. As expected, BTC has reached new ATHs against weaker and hyperinflated fiat currencies, including the Turkish Lira, Argentine Pesos, and Russian Ruble. Bitcoin’s impressive performance comes at a crucial time, with the approaching US presidential elections, theeffectsof BTC halving, and asurgein stablecoin demand. While Bitcoin’s new ATH against the EUR is promising, the wider crypto market eagerly awaits a USD-denominated ATH, as most crypto trading on exchanges takes place in USD or USD-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Data shows that the BTC/EUR trading pair generates the most volume on exchanges such as Bitstamp ($39.8 million), Binance ($36.7 million), and WhiteBit ($26.7 million). However, these volumes are dwarfed by higher-volume trading pairs like BTC/Korean Won (KRW). BTC/KRW trading volumes reach as high as $400 million daily – almost ten times more than the most-traded BTC/EUR pair. Recent data indicates that, despite flirting with ATH levels, BTC traders areholding offon profit-taking around the $71,000 level, suggesting expectations of further price increases based on current momentum. Commenting on BTC’s trajectory, seasoned analyst Peter Brandtsaidthat the leading digital asset requires a daily close above $76,000 to confirm a true breakout. At press time, BTC trades at $71,805, up 0.6% in the past 24 hours. ",

    "news_title": "SHIB Dips 3% Post $0.00001979 Monthly Peak; What's Next?",
    "news_content": "The Shiba Inu token, the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market cap, recently soared to a monthly high, reaching $0.00001979 on October 29. Following this high, SHIB experienced a slight retracement, dipping to $0.00001832—an approximate 3.86% decrease within a day. Despite this short-term pullback, the altcoin’s weekly performance remains solid, bolstered by a more potent bullish trend sweeping across the cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu’s recent momentum comes alongside a rise in the number of daily active users on its network. Between Monday and Wednesday alone, active addresses jumped from 3,398 to 5,175, setting a new high for October. This increased user activity reflects the growing interest in Shiba Inu’s blockchain and points to an enduring demand, a factor that could strengthen SHIB’s price stability.  Adding to the supply-and-demand equation, Shiba Inu’s burn program saw a spike, with a 145% rise over the past week, translating to roughly 121.76 million tokens being removed from circulation. By reducing the total supply of SHIB tokens, the burn mechanism aims to elevate the cryptocurrency’s valuation, provided demand remains steady or grows. On the technical front, Shiba Inu’s chart patterns suggest a possible cooling-off period for the token. The RSI, a key indicator of price momentum, was rising two days ago but has now shifted downward, resting at 55.25. This reading implies that the meme coin could enter a period of price stability before resuming its uptrend. Further reinforcing this consolidation potential is the altcoin’s approach to its 20-day EMA, sitting at approximately $0.00001793.  Currently, this EMA serves as an immediate support level that could trigger a bounce if the token stabilizes here. Additionally, the convergence of SHIB’s Bollinger Bands signals decreased volatility, with the price nearing the middle band at $0.00001815, implying a likely consolidation zone is forming. Although bullish momentum appears to be pausing, the overall market trend for SHIB remains upward, indicating this may be a temporary phase in a broader uptrend. As SHIB navigates this consolidation, it is poised to trade within a defined range in the near term. Holding above the 20-day EMA could keep the current bullish trend intact, while a break below could spark a shift to retest lower support zones around $0.00001665. Notably, a move below the October 3 low of $0.00001548 would signal a more pronounced bearish turn and cast doubt on the token’s medium-term outlook. On the brighter side, a resurgence in bullish sentiment could steer Shiba Inu back toward recent highs near $0.000020. A successful break above this resistance could signal a stronger bullish outlook, propelling the altcoin to challenge higher resistance points around $0.000023 and $0.000026, levels that align with the 1.212 Fibonacci extension. With volatility looming, the coming days will reveal whether SHIB’s bullish resilience can break through or if a deeper consolidation awaits in the meme cryptocurrency’s evolving story.",

    "news_title": "Is Bitcoin’s Bull Market Just Beginning? Leveraged Bets Suggest Big Moves Are Coming",
    "news_content": "The recent surge in Bitcoin price appears to align with a shift in investor behavior, according to a CryptoQuant analyst known as ‘crypto sunmoon.’ In a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst observed that the current bull market is driven by leveraged bets, particularly in derivatives markets. This trend is noteworthy as it contrasts with past market cycles where increased deposits often accompanied BTC bull runs to spot exchanges. Elaborating further on leverage bets involves using borrowed funds to multiply the size of an investment. For example, with 2x leverage, a trader can open a position twice as large as their capital. In Bitcoin futures trading, this approach can be profitable during upward price movements but also comes with risks. If the market shifts against their position, traders can face significant losses called liquidation.  The analyst notes that the inflow of Bitcoin into derivatives exchanges signals increased confidence among investors, suggesting a belief in further price gains. This confidence can create a feedback loop, where rising prices encourage additional leveraged bets, further fueling the bull market. Bitcoin bull market begins with leveraged bets “The bull market will continue as #bitcoin continues to be deposited into futures exchanges for leveraged bets using derivatives, rather than into spot exchanges for selling.” – By @t0_god Link 👇https://t.co/1egL7L2YoO pic.twitter.com/uuQPEiSWtb — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 30, 2024 With Bitcoin’s price showing an 8.2% increase over the past week, currently trading at $71,804, the role of leverage becomes increasingly relevant. Notably, BTC saw a slight retracement from its recent 24-hour high of $73,562 yet continues to maintain upward momentum.  This steady price growth and leveraged inflows signal broader investor optimism toward Bitcoin’s future price potential. According to the analyst, as long as Bitcoin continues to flow into futures rather than spot exchanges, the bullish sentiment will likely remain strong. Notably, leveraged bets happen to be just one of the several metrics of Bitcoin, suggesting a potential continuity of the ongoing increase in price. So far, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio Oscillator (SSRO) has seen low levels not seen since 2022. The decrease of this metric into lower levels means more stablecoins are being converted to BTC, therefore suggesting increasing demand for the asset. Meanwhile, the technical outlook isn’t left in one of the several metrics indicating more rally for BTC’s price. Earlier today, the renowned crypto analyst Ali highlighted that historically, BTC has increased to 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels. Should the asset follow the same pattern this time, Ali predicts BTC will surge to a price between $174,000 and $462,000. In past bull cycles, #Bitcoin has peaked between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels. Following a similar pattern, the next $BTC top could land between $174,000 and $462,000! pic.twitter.com/KUq51Tt57z — Ali (@ali_charts) October 30, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",

    "news_title": "BlackRock’s Staggering BTC Buy: 8,805 BTC Added, Holdings Rise to $29.84B",
    "news_content": "A huge development was recorded on October 30, 2024, when BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, purchased 8,805 Bitcoin (BTC). This large transaction, worth roughly $630M, is the largest single-day Bitcoin purchase by BlackRock in the past seven months, according to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain. The recent purchase takes the total Bitcoin holdings to 417,058 BTC, equivalent to $29.84B. BlackRock bought another 8,805 $BTC($630M) yesterday and currently holds 417,058 $BTC($29.84B).This marks #BlackRock's largest single-day BTC purchase in the past 7 months.https://t.co/kqNUqHBiTnhttps://t.co/D4gLhHvTvg pic.twitter.com/Mp6dDv43vb A week ago, Blackrock acquired an additional 4,869 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $328 million. This latest purchase further cements the asset management company’s position as a major institutional investor in the digital asset space. As of the reports, the asset management company’s holdings amounted to a staggering 391,484 Bitcoins, with a total valuation of $26.45 billion before today. Now, they have risen to 417,058 BTC, equivalent to $29.84B. The purchase mentioned above has followed another 4,528 BTC made by the fund just a day ago, marking its ongoing and steady Bitcoin purchases in the last few months. The rise in holdings reinforces BlackRock’s plan to integrate digital assets products into its investment portfolio. BlackRock continues to be incredibly acquisitive, raising questions about how its actions will impact the rest of the cryptocurrency space. Thus, higher institutional demand generally fuels buying pressure and could push Bitcoin’s price up in the future. The asset management company controls more than 417K Bitcoins, making it possible for it to provide an immense impact on Bitcoin’s liquidity and price. This new purchase only bolsters a bullish outlook on the world’s largest digital asset, Bitcoin. The continual purchase of Bitcoin indicates that the asset management company has high confidence in BTC’s future utility. Blackrock’s continued investment in Bitcoin is significant for the cryptocurrency market, potentially influencing other institutional investors’ sentiments and strategies. The asset manager’s substantial acquisitions often signal broader market trends and can lead to increased institutional participation in the cryptocurrency sector.",

    "news_title": "1Inch Frontend Compromised in Widespread Supply Chain Attack ",
    "news_content": "Decentralized exchange aggregator 1Inch’s website has been breached along with multiple other platforms that use the same frontend library, Lottie Player. The breach originated from malicious code injected into the Lottie Player, a widely-used animation library used by several dApps and non-crypto websites. As of now, no user wallets have been reportedly compromised. According to several posts on X (formerly Twitter), 1Inch and TEN Finance are the confirmed victims of this attack so far. However, the number could be much higher, as the exploit targeted Lottie Player versions 2.0.5 and above. Hackers have reportedly injected malicious code into the front-end JSON files of websites using these versions. This code now enables the compromised sites to perform unauthorized transactions, posing a severe threat to users’ assets and data. Reports from Blockaid indicate that the attack was introduced through a compromise of Lottie Player’s content server, where a malicious npm package was used to distribute altered code. Blockaid and other security firms have confirmed the injection of unauthorized scripts within the package. “Legitimate sites (non crypto as well) are now serving malicious content, including anti-debug evasion code. @LottieFiles, it looks like attackers have managed to push malicious versions of your package, with another version being uploaded now,” Blockaid wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post. At the time of writing, 1inch hasn’t released any official statement on the breach. However, the Lottie Player team has confirmed that they were able to identify the cause of the breach and are working on removing the affected versions. Users are strictly advised to avoid connecting wallets or interacting with affected platforms until the security issues are fully resolved. Security breaches have been the most plaguing issue of the crypto industry, and malicious activities continue to grow every year. Most recently, hackers reportedly stole $20 million worth of cryptocurrencies from the US government. The funds were also part of the $3.6 billion that the feds seized from the Bitfinex hackers. Blockchain lender Radiant Capital suffered one of the biggest hacks of this year, losing more than $50 million. The hackers gained control of the firm’s private keys and rapidly drained these assets. However, the investigation and prosecution of these crimes have also intensified. FBT recently arrested the SEC X (formerly Twitter) account hacker. The accused is a 25-year-old Alabama man named Eric Council Jr. Earlier this year, the Council allegedly hacked the SEC’s X account and posted false news about Bitcoin ETF approvals, which significantly affected the market. Yet, the feds believe Council wasn’t the brains of this operation and they are trying to negotiate a plea deal with him. So far, crypto hacks have exceeded $2.1 billion in 2024, with CeFi platforms taking the biggest hits.",

    "news_title": "How many crypto millionaires are there? Meet the industry’s biggest players",
    "news_content": "Many people have stumbled upon unexpected wealth thanks to cryptocurrencies. You don’t have to be an expert to see that Bitcoin’s price is sky-high compared to when it first started. Back around 12-15 years ago, you could buy thousands of Bitcoins for almost nothing. It’s believed that the biggest gains were made by those who believed in digital currencies at the very beginning. But fast forward to today, and new coins are still popping up, offering fresh opportunities to make a fortune. Recent reports show that the number of crypto millionaires is on the rise, proving that people are still cashing in on this digital gold rush. How many cryptocurrency millionaires are there? Crypto millionaires come from diverse backgrounds and employ various strategies to maintain their wealth. Beyond early investors, many have made their fortunes through savvy trading, capitalizing on market volatility to buy low and sell high. Others have really flourished in the world of decentralized finance, finding ways to earn passive income by lending out their assets or providing liquidity to exchanges. Some crypto millionaires really make the most of their expertise by launching exciting projects that solve real problems or offer new experiences, drawing in significant investment. The crypto world changes fast, and these millionaires realize that staying attuned to market trends is key to their continued success. How many crypto millionaires are there in the world? According to the 2024 report by New World Wealth and Henley&Partners, there are currently 172,300 individuals worldwide who hold crypto assets worth over $1 million. The number of millionaires exclusively owning Bitcoin has more than doubled compared to last year, reaching 85,400. Wealth growth in the crypto industry is being observed at all levels. There are now 325 crypto centimillionaires — individuals with crypto assets exceeding $100 million — and 28 crypto billionaires. Among the six new crypto billionaires who emerged in the past year, five attribute their wealth to Bitcoin, highlighting its dominant role among long-term investors. Worldwide crypto wealth statistics | Source:Henley&Partners The surge in wealthy individuals within the crypto space can be traced back to the growth of Bitcoin ETFs, which have gathered over $50 billion in assets since their introduction in January 2024, enticing institutional investors. Additionally, just this March, Bitcoin (BTC) soared to a new all-time high of about $73,750, contributing to the total market value of crypto assets climbing to $2.43 trillion at the time of writing. This growth has undoubtedly made many crypto holders richer. Although some coins still haven’t bounced back to their 2021 peak values, the acceptance of cryptocurrencies by big names like BlackRock and Fidelity could fuel even more wealth for those heavily invested. According to Forbes, the list of crypto whales features the founders of prominent exchanges, developers behind blockchain platforms, and other influential figures closely tied to the crypto scene. Here are the five richest among them. Paolo Ardoino is a notable player in the crypto world, stepping into the CEO role at Tether in 2023. His journey began in 2014 as a senior software developer at Bitfinex, and since then, he has been instrumental in Tether’s growth, expanding its stablecoin offerings and enhancing blockchain infrastructure. Ardoino’s net worth is estimated at$3.9 billion. Michael Saylor is the founder and CEO of MicroStrategy, a company that specializes in business analytics software. Since 2020, he has passionately championed Bitcoin, leading his firm to make bold acquisitions in the cryptocurrency. This innovative approach has allowed MicroStrategy to stand out as a pioneer among public companies in the ever-evolving crypto arena. Saylor’s net worth is estimated at$4.4 billion. Giancarlo Devasini co-founded Bitfinex and served as its CEO for a period. Currently, he’s the Chief Financial Officer and holds a 47% stake in Tether, a position that has greatly contributed to his wealth. His net worth is estimated at$9.2 billion. Brian Armstrong is the founder and CEO of Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. With its easy navigation and solid security, Coinbase has gained a loyal following. Beyond his work with the exchange, Armstrong actively supports the blockchain community, co-founding the Stand With Crypto movement to encourage education and advocate for favorable regulatory changes. His net worth is estimated at$11.2 billion. Often called ‘CZ’, Changpeng Zhao is the founder and former CEO of Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange out there. His wealth stems from his ability to elevate Binance into a premier trading platform and his strategic investments in innovative blockchain projects that are making waves in the industry. Although he stepped down as CEO following an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, his influence as a leading crypto whale remains strong. Zhao’s net worth is estimated at$33 billion. In summary, there are around 85,000 known millionaires in the world, although the true number is difficult to ascertain due to the pseudonymous or even anonymous features baked into cryptocurrency technology. The wealth of crypto whales reflects not only their personal success but also the growing significance of digital assets in the global economy.",

    "news_title": "Crypto Titans Pour $200M into U.S. Election, Backing Trump and Harris Campaigns",
    "news_content": "The cryptocurrency sector has made a significant mark on the 2024 U.S. presidential race, contributing over $200 million to support key candidates. New figures from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) reveal that these contributions are spread across political action committees (PACs), candidates, and various political organizations. This heavy financial backing highlights the crypto industry’s ambition to shape regulatory policies within the next administration. 🚨NEW: With just one week out from Election Day, we’re getting some new #crypto election spending numbers. According to recent @FEC filings, the crypto industry has now donated well over $200 million to various PACs, candidates and political organizations. More to come on this.… Notably, Donald Trump has drawn substantial financial support from prominent figures within the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin investor and Tether advocate Howard Lutnick alone has contributed $6.4 million to Trump’s campaign. The Winklevoss twins, founders of the Gemini exchange, have collectively added another $2.04 million. Furthermore, these contributions emphasize the level of confidence the crypto sector has in Trump’s ability to address its interests. Further support for Trump has come from Kraken founder Jesse Powell, who contributed $844,943, along with Bijan Tehrani, co-founder of Stake, who donated $852,396. Additionally, JP Richardson, CEO of Exodus, and entrepreneur Gary Cardone have donated amounts close to $850,000 each. These donations mark a strong showing of the crypto sector’s support for Trump’s campaign, suggesting the industry sees value in a potential Trump administration in addressing digital asset regulation. In addition, while Trump has attracted the lion’s share of crypto-related contributions, Vice President Kamala Harris has also gained notable support from the crypto industry. Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen tops the list of her crypto-related donors, contributing $10million to her campaign. Moreover, This substantial donation reflects a considerable level of confidence in Harris from a key player within the crypto world. Tech investor Vinod Khosla and Coinbase’s early investor Reid Hoffman have also backed Harris, with Khosla contributing $1 million and Hoffman adding $250,000. Comparatively, while Harris’s contributions from the crypto sector remain smaller in comparison to Trump’s, she has nevertheless garnered support from high-profile blockchain and tech investors. This support for Harris underscores the influence that the crypto sector seeks to exert over candidates from both sides of the political aisle. Elon Musk, the world’s richest individual, has also emerged as a significant player in Trump’s campaign. Musk created America PAC, which has since channeled $72 million toward Trump’s re-election efforts between July and September alone. Musk’s financial backing signifies a clear alignment with Trump’s policies and positions within the Republican Party. Therefore, as Election Day approaches, the surge in crypto donations highlights the strategic influence the industry hopes to secure in shaping future digital asset regulations. With major financial players aligning with both Trump and Harris, the crypto sector’s contributions could impact policies regarding cryptocurrency and blockchain in the next administration.",

    "news_title": "Ripple Partners with IRC to Transform Humanitarian Aid Supply",
    "news_content": "Ripple Labs has joined forces with the International Rescue Committee to enhance charitable aid distribution. The cooperation involves a commitment of $1 million annually for several years. The company will test its $RLUSD stablecoin for cash relief programs and international fund transfers. The IRC has a strong history of providing emergency assistance globally. It operates in over 40 countries and has given away more than $70 million in cash and vouchers. This collaboration allows the firm to use its technological expertise with operational experience. Together, they plan to change how social aid is delivered during disasters. 🌍💙 Could @ripple's #blockchain save lives?Ripple just partnered with the International Rescue Committee, pledging $1M annually to test fund distribution using their $RLUSD #stablecoin.Their fast payments could enable secure transfers to regions without banking… pic.twitter.com/LwXglKVNqh Eric van Miltenburg, Senior Vice Head of Strategic Initiatives at Ripple, highlighted the importance of this relationship. He said that combining Ripple’s technology with the IRC’s experience can create new solutions. Consequently, this partnership will help communities access essential resources more quickly and securely. David Miliband, president and CEO of the firm, also expressed excitement about the agreement. He said that his organisation is committed to exploring new solutions for humanitarian crises. Additionally, Ripple’s technology will greatly enhance cash relief efforts, especially in areas with limited banking access. The affiliation will use Ripple’s XRP Ledger and the RLUSD stablecoin to help deliver critical assistance effectively. This integration aims to improve the speed and reliability of cash relief programs, as the technology could change how assistance is delivered in emergencies. Furthermore, Ripple’s RLUSD token will play an essential role in optimizing interconnected payments. It will allow smooth crypto-to-fiat conversions to enhance liquidity for aid operations. Thus, the partnership seeks to lower costs while streamlining the aid delivery process. This collaboration marks an important step toward using blockchain technology for helping needs. Ripple and the IRC want to ensure that assistance reaches those in need quickly. Their shared goal is to tackle global challenges in aid distribution effectively. As they move forward, Ripple and the IRC will explore the potential of blockchain technology. This alliance serves as a model for future collaborations between tech firms and humanitarian organizations. By combining their expertise, they hope to find effective solutions for nationwide challenges in aid distribution.",

    "news_content": "Crypto cards like the Bybit Card have become a popular way for people to spend their cryptocurrency. Still, recent regulatory crackdowns on exchanges are raising concerns. Cryptocurrencies have existed since 2009, when Bitcoin became the world’s first option, and it didn’t take long before these currencies entered the online gambling scene. The first crypto casino, called SatoshiDice, after the founder of Bitcoin, appeared in 2012. The presidential election is scheduled to be held on November 5, 2024. Currently, the country is witnessing a Biden-Trump face-off that may lead to increased polarization and competing narratives in the coming days. The Trustee in charge of Ontario’s “Crypto King” Aiden Pleterski’s bankruptcy proceedings wants a judge to deny the accused a discharge from bankruptcy. The accounting firm, Grant Thornton, says the 25-year-old should return more than $4.5 million in assets and funds that are currently untraceable. A crypto casino no-deposit bonus and promotion have become popular in online gambling, allowing players to win real money without risking their funds. However, these promotions are not without their regulatory challenges, as regulatory bodies grapple with compliance issues, consumer protection, and responsible gambling practices. Forex trading has been steadily gaining popularity in Nigeria over the years. People are looking at the opportunity to trade currencies from around the world with the potential to earn a profit. Both newcomers and experienced investors can participate in the speculative trading of currency pairs. Notably, there has been increased access to online trading platforms in recent years. The number of Nigerian forex brokers is on the rise as they take advantage of this growing market. In recent years, there has been an emergence of new online gambling platforms redefining the boundaries and possibilities of the igaming industry. Among these innovations, crypto casinos represent a particularly intriguing development. These digital platforms, where cryptocurrency is used for transactions, are nudging the frontiers of online gambling into uncharted territories. The landscape of gambling is undergoing a significant transformation globally, and Japan is no exception. With the rise of digital currencies, a new era of online gambling has emerged, known as cryptocurrency casinos. These platforms are gaining popularity among Japanese players, offering a modern twist to the traditional online casino experience. It all started in October 2021 when Grayscale Investments proposed to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF and appealed to the SEC. Later, in June 2022, the SEC declined Grayscale’s appeal to list its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as a spot Bitcoin ETF. Crypto staking has been an area of controversy over recent years. While completely decentralized finance platforms such as Aave attract a consistent TVL, centralized DeFi products, such as those offered by hedge funds and other traditional companies, have often gone bankrupt. In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, regulatory changes can feel like the only constant. Keeping up-to-date with these changes is essential, particularly for players and operators in the Bitcoin casino industry. Let’s dive into recent cryptocurrency regulation updates and explore what they mean for Bitcoin casinos. Are you thinking of buying cryptocurrency? Then you’re likely pondering if any critical rules are in place for crypto holders. There is a common delusion that crypto isn’t regulated. But the truth is that some countries have started controlling these digital assets. This is within reason, as crypto is getting more and more popular. In this page, we’ll look at the present crypto rules in various nations so you are informed before you invest! As the popularity of Bitcoin Gold continues to grow, so does the importance of understanding the regulatory and legal landscape surrounding its use. In this article, we delve into the intricate world of Bitcoin Gold regulation and legal considerations. The regulations for the crypto market are blurry but one thing that is crystal clear is the potential of the market. These days more and more casinos will accept your deposits in cryptocurrencies. You can use Bitcoin, Ethereum and in some cases, over 20 different coins. Consider the legal and security aspects of playing BTC roulette on the Best Bitcoin Roulette sites and avoid all chances of fraud, scams, or other security breaches. The Chinese government is famous for its strict regulations. In 2021, it banned cryptocurrency mining and trading. It also banned online casinos, which are still gaining popularity nationwide. Before we consider the possibility of Bitcoin becoming legal tender in the US, let’s look at how other countries have adopted the cryptocurrency by 2023 The Hungarian government has been supportive of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. You can learn from this article, how Bitcoin is being adopted in Hungary While the crypto market continues to deal with the challenges of the bear market, regulators also have made life a living hell for some firms in the sector. One of such is Ripple — the company that has been at loggerheads with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over various allegations. The battle, which looks to be unending, has taken different turns to be in both parties' favour. Each participant in the cryptocurrency industry should think about the future of crypto compliance. Regulators' interest in cryptocurrency compliance has been sparked in part by the widespread use of digital currencies.",

    "news_title": "Crypto News editorial: Technologies in the sphere of crypto and digital economy",
    "news_content": "When traditional investments are thought of, there can be many that will initially be thought of. This has happened because of their place in history. The world’s largest cryptocurrency, with a market of over $1 trillion, Bitcoin has become a favorite asset of both retail and institutions alike seeking to preserve their wealth in the most secure and economically sound asset in human existence. Now, Bitcoin is stepping into an even more intriguing and rewarding phase. Popular utility meme coin SquidGrow gearing up to launch its privacy-focused DEX aggregator SilentSwap amidst the growing adoption of the crypto sector. The history of finance started in ancient times when farmers and tribespeople bartered goods caught on the hunt or grown in their fields. Soon after, whether shells or precious metals, ancient peoples improved their trade through more durable and widely accepted currencies than sheep or wheat. For centuries after, all trade happened directly between two parties, one peer to another. The world of cryptocurrency investing has evolved dramatically in recent years, and one of the biggest changes is the rise of AI trading bots. These bots are transforming how people invest in crypto by using advanced algorithms and automation to trade more efficiently and profitably. For many, AI trading bots have made crypto investing simpler, more accessible, and less time-consuming. Let’s face it, when swapping crypto, the last thing anyone wants is to watch their hard-earned gains get gobbled up by fees, right? Unfortunately, some exchanges are like hidden fee ninjas, sneaking in those extra costs, or just plain overcharging. But don’t lose hope just yet! There are some heroes out there, platforms that offer the best exchange rates and actually care about users getting the most bang for their crypto buck. Here are 5 of them. In the Web3 market, many games focus more on their blockchain and token systems than on actual gameplay. Often, these so-called crypto games provide only basic mechanics like simple tapping, which lacks engagement and depth. CornBattles takes a different approach, offering a rich and evolving gaming experience that blends traditional game mechanics with blockchain integration. Data ownership sounds simple and straightforward as a concept: the possession of and responsibility for information. Yet, in the digital age, where privacy vulnerabilities and data breaches are prevalent, ensuring that data is accessible to every interested party while maintaining the right balance of ownership and responsibility has become an increasingly complex task. In 2024, global cryptocurrency ownership is estimated to average 6.8%, with over 560 million people now holding crypto assets. As adoption grows, the role of crypto exchanges, generally divided into centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) platforms, becomes increasingly critical. However, while many CEXs and DEXs have been operating for years, they remain somewhat inflexible, struggling to adapt to the evolving needs of Web2 users accustomed to widely accessible and easy-to-navigate financial services. Investing efficiently in cryptocurrencies is challenging: There are various complexities with multiple blockchains and wallets, and the high volatility exposes you to numerous risks. Additionally, it isn’t easy to implement a well-defined strategy and adhere to it consistently, which is why most traders are not profitable. Trakx created its crypto-index trading platform to solve these complexities: With crypto index funds, you can invest in multiple assets at once, automatically implementing period passive rebalancing on predefined factors, sound risk management, and advanced diversification. The Play to Earn (P2E) concept has taken the gaming industry by storm, reshaping the way players engage with games. Rather than simply playing for fun, they can now convert in-game progress into real-world benefits, which adds a new dimension to how games are perceived. The total market cap of P2E tokens is $7.19 billion at the moment of writing. The online casino sector never stops developing, and tech advancements are the leading industry pillar. Blockchain was integrated into gambling over a decade ago and has been steadily evading in the following years. Now, no one is surprised by the accessibility of cryptocurrencies on gaming sites, and some operators have already made it a step further and implemented NFTs. How does it work, and which benefits do players receive when interacting with this technology? Cryptocurrency offers financial freedom and investment alternatives. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and several altcoins have given consumers more control over their wealth than ever before. This independence comes with the obligation to secure digital assets. How to store cryptocurrency is a crucial issue for investors. Hot and cold storage are the major types of cryptocurrency wallets, which protect digital funds. Users choose between these two techniques based on security, accessibility, and convenience. Getting new players to your online gambling platform is less than half the battle. The hard part is getting them to stay. Ensuring player retention is crucial for long-term success in an overcrowded market. But how do you make sure that players will visit your online casino site and stick around to play at it? Cryptocurrency markets are highly dynamic, and two titans always lead the charge; Bitcoin and Ethereum. While these two are at the top of the heap in the cryptocurrency world, are they correlated? The answer can have huge implications, not only for investors but also for traders. In this article, we shall discuss the relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin, their correlation, and why staking them through a service like STAKING AI brings in lucrative opportunities, such as a free $100 staking bonus for signing up. As the world increasingly turns its attention to combating climate change, Europe has positioned itself at the forefront of sustainability initiatives. Within this context, the intersection of cryptocurrency and sustainability has become a hot topic of discussion. There is growing interest in how blockchain technology, the backbone of cryptocurrencies, can contribute to Europe’s green agenda. UniPayment is a versatile cryptocurrency payment system that will act as an all-in-one tool to be beneficial for both individual and business clients. It provides various solutions which help to make the usage of the digital currencies as the means of payment for purchases, Internet payments, and worldwide commerce. UniPayment is a digital wallet and business account that allows users to pay, store, and exchange multiple types of cryptocurrencies. As a seasoned crypto analyst with over a decade of experience in the Greek market, I’ve witnessed firsthand the transformative power of cryptocurrency in our financial landscape. Today, I’m excited to share how Bcash, Greece’s premier Bitcoin ATM provider, is spearheading a revolution in crypto accessibility and adoption across the country. As the blockchain ecosystem grows, the need for seamless interaction between different networks becomes increasingly important. Multi-chain interoperability is essential for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized applications (dApps), and broader blockchain adoption. PAW Chain is leading this evolution with its innovative Layer 3-centric architecture, designed to bridge the divide between disparate blockchain networks. As cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies evolve, the gaming industry is undergoing significant changes. One of the most exciting projects that combines these two spheres is Star Atlas—a vast metaverse game where players explore space, engage in battles, and earn real money. Effective asset management and strategic planning are crucial for success in this complex universe.",

The problem of vendor lock-in has always been a bottleneck in making a supply chain seamless. The issue arises when someone is essentially compelled to use a product or service irrespective of its quality, as there are no practical possibilities left to switch away! Lumio, the first VM abstraction framework, frees the decentralized world developers of this shackle by allowing them to build applications with any VM on any chain. To drive its vision of unlocking wealth-generation opportunities for everyone forward, the world’s first licensed social investment platform,Zignaly, held a community voting for its $ZIG tokenomics upgrade. Braavos, a next-gen wallet on Starknet that prioritizes intuitive and safe use of services for crypto users, has integratedOwlto Finance, the unique intent-centric interoperability protocol that envisions bridging the multilayered blockchain world by leveraging AI. Although Owlto Finance has been supporting Braavos for a long time now, this formal partnership marks Braavos integrating Owlto Finance, highlighting a deeper and more collaborative relationship. CryptoHeap, a provider of cryptocurrency staking services, has announced its ongoing expansions across the globe as well as improvements on their service delivery. In an effort to simplify the process of staking participation worldwide, CryptoHeap boasts 36.9 million registered users from 174 countries. In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, one voice has emerged that is garnering attention for its bold assumptions and unwavering belief in the industry’s potential. That voice belongs to Mr. Thank You, an enigmatic digital phenomenon that has amassed over 44 million followers on social media. Ever since Bitcoin hit an all-time high (ATH) at $73,740 in March, the crypto king has been experiencing a lull in activity. Prices have since been ranging, with not much driving the sentiment and momentum. In 2024, crypto gaming grows a lot. Digital coins play big roles in many sectors, but they now show up more in online games. Players enjoy faster transactions and lower fees and the Blockchain tech adds safety, which users like. Game developers see the benefits too. When it comes to finding the right token to put money in, crypto investors tend to follow a few key market metrics. Some diligently look for the next big crypto presale to invest in. Others track which tokens are being widely used, whether that is within a gaming project or on an anonymous casino. Another key metric is the activity of crypto whales. The University of Applied Sciences in Business Administration Zurich plans to launch a Bitcoin (BTC) course next year. The unique course will teach people about Bitcoin, delve into the importance of cryptocurrencies in the economic and financial landscape, and help students learn to integrate Bitcoin into business. The university intends to start the course in March 2025. In this exclusive interview, Crypto News talks to the visionary CEO of Summer.fi, Chris Bradbury, about his personal journey from aerospace engineering to spearheading innovation in decentralized finance.",

    "news_content": "Xlence is gaining recognition in the world of forex and CFD trading, offering a broad range of features that cater to both beginner and professional traders. In this Xlence review, we’ll walk you through seven key things you should know before choosing Xlence as your broker. This guide will help you weigh the benefits and understand some areas for potential improvement. The investment landscape offers a plethora of options, but few assets have garnered as much attention as Bitcoin (BTC), the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX), and gold (XAU). Each represents a different class—cryptocurrency, equities, and commodities, respectively—and offers unique opportunities and risks. This article delves into their historical performance, volatility, correlations, and future price projections to provide a comprehensive comparison. Currently, trading has become very popular, attracting the attention of individuals worldwide. Trading is no longer correlated only with financial experts or the rich and influential but with anyone interested in making considerable profits. But why did this change in perception occur? Well, now the world is dealing with currency devaluations and inflationary pressures, so people want something to secure themselves against the future’s uncertainty. Luckily, the investment landscape can help with this. The iGaming industry is always looking for new ways to improve and expand on their offering. One of the most recent developments in online gambling is the adoption of digital currencies. Anyone, with even a passing interesting in iGaming, knows it is possible to play slots online for real money but what about playing slots and other casinos games using cryptocurrency? Continue below as we take a closer look at how the iGaming industry has fully embraced digital currencies. Cryptocurrency has significantly influenced various sectors, and one area experiencing rapid growth is online gambling. The global iGaming market has doubled from $37 billion before the pandemic to over $70 billion in 2024. This remarkable expansion underscores the substantial impact of crypto gambling on the wider digital betting landscape. Year-to-date, about 1337 public token sales have taken place, out of which over 77% have been IDOs or Initial DEX Offerings. Meanwhile, 21.2% have been IEOs (Initial Exchange Offerings) and only 1.5% have been ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings). This clearly proves the hype IDOs are experiencing currently.  The Democratic Party decided that Joe Biden can’t beat Donald Trump in the 2024 Presidential Elections. Of course, due to medical reasons, it would appear that Biden is not able to spend another term in the office, so a switch made sense from that point too. Now, the candidate who needs to stand against Donald Trump is Kamala Harris. While those on the political scene know who she is, a casual voter might not be aware of the values she holds dear. Understanding the best crypto payment gateways for businesses in 2024 means navigating through numerous options, seamlessly integrating robust technological features while ensuring ease of use for both merchants and customers. In the last decade, the world has seen an enormous uptake in the use of cryptocurrencies. Once a niche hobby, this revolutionary system is now a major global financial phenomenon which continues to evolve at an impressive pace. Its impact on global economies and societies is still unclear, but it is rapidly becoming evident that these innovative currencies are here to stay. And as things continue to develop, the real question about crypto remains — can it be a force for good? Cryptocurrencies have increasingly gained traction in various sectors, including online gambling and casinos, sparking discussions about their potential to replace traditional fiat currencies. The question of whether crypto will entirely replace fiat at online casinos is complex and multifaceted, influenced by technological advancements, regulatory landscapes, and market dynamics. As the 2024 presidential election draws near, speculation intensifies about who might replace President Biden if he drops out. A critical consideration for investment markets is each candidate’s stance on cryptocurrency. Analysts at multinational consulting giant McKinsey & Company have concluded that the market capitalization of real-world assets (RWAs) tokenized on a blockchain could hit $2 trillion by 2030. In a new report, the analysts noted that this growth is likely because traditional financial companies are slowly adopting blockchain technology for several solutions. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, traders need a reliable platform that not only provides extensive market access but also ensures a secure and intuitive trading environment. Navigating the vast ocean of online trading platforms can be a daunting task. In a world where scam platforms are unfortunately all too common, it is crucial to thoroughly examine the legitimacy of each platform. This article offers an in-depth FiniWise.com review, considering its offerings, regulatory standing, and user experiences to determine its integrity and reliability. One thing that has gone hand in hand with the advent of Bitcoin has been the means to make the greatest bets on its wild price swings. Finding a reliable platform to navigate the volatile markets can be daunting. Capixtrade emerges as a contender, offering a suite of services designed to cater to both novice and seasoned traders alike. In this comprehensive Capixtrade review article, we delve into the various features and offerings of Capixtrade to help you determine if it’s the right platform for your crypto trading endeavors. In a market that is notoriously volatile, stablecoins such as USDT (Tether) and TUSD (TrueUSD) have emerged as key participants, providing the much-required stability that is required. Their usability, accessibility, and user experience are what differentiate them from one another, despite the fact that both attempt to keep a constant value that is pegged to fiat currencies. So, let’s compare USDT vs TUSD and get to know what works best for users. The last few days have been some of the best for crypto market participants and investors. Bitcoin has been on a relatively positive trajectory over the past months, but it got even better when it crossed the $60,000 mark on the 28th of February, 2024. The snowball effect Bitcoin always has on altcoins is one thing that ever goes out of notice. Aside from the apparent increase in investors’ portfolios, this pump could bring many more likely events to other tokens and projects in the market. Here is an overall outlook on what to expect after the bull run. The all-time high for the global cryptocurrency market was beyond $3 Trillion. During the crypto winter of 2022, the market size shrunk down to $800 Billion. Majority of cryptocurrencies saw the dip and traded at the lows. However, tables are turning now and not only the crypto tokens but the broader crypto market is in uptrend. In 2024, amidst the intensifying competition within the realms of cryptocurrency and blockchain, seeking the expertise of professionals has become imperative for project success. In this article, we delve into the six best agencies specializing in crypto marketing. Each crypto marketing agency featured here possesses unique strategies and experiences capable of helping your project stand out and thrive within the dynamic landscape of the cryptocurrency market.",

    "news_content": "Telegram gaming platform, Dogizen, has now raised over $800k in its presale—the first-ever Telegram ICO—making its case as one of the best investments today in the TON blockchain ecosystem. Staking cryptocurrency is one of the best ways to grow your digital assets. In 2024 staking platforms offer a lot of rewards and choosing the right crypto staking platform is key to maximizing your earnings. Among the top ones is STAKING AI, a platform that offers high returns and industry-leading technology. Ethereum meme coin NEIRO, also known as “First Neiro On Ethereum”, is pumping, breaking into the top 100 tokens by market cap after hitting new all-time highs over the weekend. Staking has become one of the most preferred ways for crypto investors to get some passive income. In this article, we will review the Top 8 Staking Platforms of 2024 as mentioned below. But before that, let’s start with what staking is and how to choose the best staking platform are important factors to be considered. In 2024, earning passive income through crypto staking has never been easier or more profitable. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just starting, the right strategies can help you generate steady returns without actively trading. One of the most effective platforms for building passive income is CryptoBox. With its AI-driven strategies, intuitive interface, and secure staking opportunities, CryptoBox stands out as a top choice for investors. Ripple (XRP) CEO issued a warning recently after hackers tried to swindle Indians through a YouTube attack while Litecoin (LTC) unlocked a new supply level. Both actions led to slowed activities for the tokens, and investors opted for a new Trade2Earn rewards platform called FXGuys ($FXG), which is currently conducting a lucrative presale. In the evolution journey of Cryptocurrency, earning rewards is an interesting way to make investments stronger. Cryptocurrencies have changed the way we think about money, providing new ways to build wealth. As we move into 2024, here are ten effective strategies to take advantage of this digital money boom. Let’s start with the first and most profitable method: Cryptocurrency staking. TradFi’s appetite for crypto products runs red hot, and institutions want Bitcoin and BTC ecosystem exposure. Last week, Bitcoin and related products absorbed $284 million of the $321 million total crypto investment inflows. With 50 basis points cut, another 50 basis points of cuts projected this year, and the dot plot showing a further 100 basis points in 2025, the runway is clear for crypto and gold to make crazy rallies in the coming twelve months. Knowing your staking operation is compliant with law standards is considered one way of safeguarding your investments and a means of maintaining peace of mind. This paper will discuss, among other important information, the top five places to stake with full regulation, with a particular bias toward StakingBonus.com. We will compare StakingBonus.com to other leading platforms as mentioned below. The crypto market is currently experiencing extreme volatility, triggered by Bitcoin’s latest fall. Meanwhile, investors from all over the crypto industry, especially Ripple (XRP) and BNB (BNB) holders, are moving to FXGuys ($FXG) because of its expected price pump. In the dynamic world of Forex trading, selecting the right broker can be the difference between a profitable venture and a costly endeavor. For traders in Thailand, the choice of a Forex broker can significantly impact trading outcomes. One prominent example is the Forex broker Thailand, which offers a range of services and features that can influence trading success. This article explores why choosing the right Forex broker is crucial and examines key factors such as spreads, market access, account types, and trading platforms. Every month, 2-3 new Tap2Earn games, often referred to as “tap games,” hit the market. These games offer players the chance to earn tokens or cryptocurrency through gameplay. Unfortunately, most of these games lack originality in terms of gameplay, features or characters — they simply copy the leaders in the GameFi segment, hoping to “grab a piece of the pie” by attracting some users. Gone are the days of waiting for bank transfers or dealing with credit card fees. Now, you can fund your online casino account with a few taps, thanks to the wonders of digital currency. If you’re dipping your toes into the blockchain waters, knowing which tokens are the most popular for deposits and withdrawals can make your gaming experience smoother and better. Mobile crypto mining is gaining popularity, allowing users to mine cryptocurrencies directly from their smartphones. Cloud mining enables enthusiasts to mine without the need for expensive hardware or technical skills. While it’s easier, mobile mining usually provides lower rewards than traditional mining. iOS serves as a robust platform for mobile mining, known for its stability and security, with many high-quality apps available. Viral Telegram gaming crypto, DOGS, was set to debut with a hotly anticipated listing today, but has pushed back its token generation event (TGE) to 26th August, much to the annoyance of its community. In today’s fast-paced financial landscape, managing wealth effectively requires more than just traditional strategies. Rocorp.co, a forward-thinking company in the financial services industry, has introduced a new approach to wealth management that combines personalized planning, cutting-edge technology, and a strong emphasis on education. This approach is designed to meet the diverse needs of individuals looking to secure their financial future. The crypto market has shaken off its winter blues, and the looming shadow of a Solana ETF has cast a spotlight on the meme coin sector. Investors are sniffing out opportunities like never before, eager to capitalize on the potential windfall. As the online trading environment continues to evolve, traders are on the lookout for platforms that not only meet current needs but also show promise for the future. In this VictoryXCap review, we dive deep into what VictoryXCap.com has to offer, evaluating its performance as of August 2024 and discussing what traders should look for as we approach 2025. With shockwaves from the recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump, followed by Biden dropping out of the race, politics is pulling the interest of people worldwide. Solciety is stepping into the spotlight at the perfect time, with the potential for massive returns, as this new Solana meme coin continues to cause a stir with its presale, capturing enormous interest from investors and already raising $1.1M. The convergence of crypto and forex is a big deal in the financial world. This means new opportunities for traders but also new challenges. This article will look into the pros and cons of this merging landscape.",

    "news_content": "Diving into the world of cryptocurrency exchanges can feel like navigating a maze. Yet, it’s a crucial gateway that opens up endless possibilities for your digital asset journey. With the right platform, you’ll have the power to execute any transaction you desire, from basic trading to complex operations. It was at the end of 2021 that games with prizes in digital assets (tokens) became a fever. A new segment emerged, called play-to-earn, where users were rewarded according to their performance in these crypto games. Bitcoin, priced at $68,386 today, has come a long way from its humble beginnings. Launched in 2009 by an enigmatic figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin introduced a new era of digital currency and decentralized finance. Initially dismissed by the mainstream financial world, Bitcoin has since carved out a legitimate space in global markets, emerging as a favored asset for those seeking diversification beyond traditional investments. The possibility of passive income from cryptocurrencies keeps attracting more and more users in 2024, trying to figure out the ways of reaping benefits from digital assets. Among many options, crypto staking is one of the most popular options: this feature allows investors to lock their tokens and reward them, respectively. Below, we will take a closer look at the crypto staking option in detail, and then provide seven more ideas for earning passive income. The integration of cryptocurrency into various sectors has been nothing short of revolutionary, and sports are no exception.

Personal information of the User may be transmitted and stored on servers and facilities located in your region or other country. Some of these countries do not provide the same level of data protection as the country in which the User resides and are not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection. 6.9. When the Operator transmits the information of the User to other countries, it will use, transmit and protect this information as described in this Policy. In order to provide services or manage the User’s participation in promotions, donations and events, the Operator may transfer the personal information of the User that it collects to countries that do not provide the same level of data protection as the country in which the User resides and are not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection. In any case, the Operator shall transmit the personal information of the User to these countries only with the consent of the User, when necessary for the services that are provided to the User, and subject to appropriate security measures that ensure the protection of the personal information of the User, such as standard contractual clauses. 7.1. The Operator shall take technical and organizational legal measures to ensure protection of the User’s personal information against unlawful or accidental access to it, destruction, modification, blocking, copying, distribution, as well as against other illegal actions. 7.2. The Project software provides prevention of unauthorized access to information and (or) its transmission to persons who do not have the right to access information. 7.3. The Operator shall also take the following measures to ensure the security of personal information: 7.3.1. Threats to the personal information security during its processing are determined; 7.3.2. Organizational and technical measures are applied to ensure the personal information security during its processing; 7.3.3. Persons responsible for processing the User’s Personal Data shall be appointed from among the Operator’s employees; 7.3.4. Means of information protection are used, which have passed the conformity assessment procedure in the prescribed manner; 7.3.5. The effectiveness of the measures taken to ensure the security of personal information is evaluated; 7.3.6. Procedures are adopted to identify unauthorized access to personal information; 7.3.7. Personal information modified or destroyed due to unauthorized access to it is restored; 7.3.8. Rules for access to personal information are established, as well as registration and recording of all actions performed with personal information; 7.3.9. Only licensed software is used on the Operator’s workstations involved in processing the Users’ data; 7.3.10. Limited access at the technical and organizational level to the Operator’s workstations involved in processing Personal Data; 7.3.11. There is constant control over the measures taken to ensure the security of personal information. 7.4. The Operator shall not be liable for the actions of third parties who have gained access to the User’s personal information as a result of unauthorized access to the Website and (or) the Application, as well as due to other unlawful actions committed by third parties when the Operator could not foresee or prevent them. 8.1. Depending on the settings of the User’s web browser, the Operator collects information that is automatically transmitted by the browser when the User visits the Website. This transmission is made using cookies. This information typically includes the IP address currently assigned to the User device, the type of operating system, and the web browser used. 8.2. A cookie is a small text file that the web server places in the memory of the User device. There are “session” and “permanent” cookies. 8.3. Session cookies are used by the Operator to assign a unique identification number to the User device each time he visits the Website. Session cookies are deleted when the current browser window is closed. They are used to maintain the functionality of the Website and to analyze the User’s work on the Website, for example, which pages the User visits, which links he uses and how long he remains on each page. 8.4. When allowed, the Operator uses permanent cookies that are not deleted immediately after the web browser is closed, but are stored on the computer for a certain period of time or until the User deletes them on his own. Each time the User visits the Website, the web server recognizes permanent cookies stored in the memory of the User’s device. By assigning a unique identifier to the User’s device, a database of User actions and preferences is created. This unique identifier also allows to define: how often the User visits the Website, at what frequency the User returns to the Website, how he uses the Website, how effective are the Website promotion activities. 8.5. The Application does not use cookies. However, the Application may use third-party code and libraries that use cookies to collect information and improve its services. The User always has the opportunity to accept or reject these cookies and find out when they are sent to the User’s device. 8.6. Cookies do not contain Personal Data, but only record actions on the User’s device. If the User goes to the Website using the link that was sent to his email, or if the User creates a “user ID” during one of the visits, the information provided by the Website cookies or cookies of third-party service providers may be related to the information in the records, which will make personal identification of the User possible. 8.7. Session cookies do not require the prior consent of the User to use them, since they are necessary for the operation of the Website and will be deleted after closing the web browser. 8.8. Permanent cookies that track past actions and preferences of the User, but are not necessary for the operation of the Website, require the prior consent of the User. When visiting the Website, the User agrees to use permanent cookies unless he changes his device settings so that these cookies are not saved. The same applies to third-party cookies. 8.9. The Operator uses cookies to ensure the most efficient interaction of users with the Website, in particular, the following cookies are used: Analytical cookies are cookies that are used to monitor the interaction of Users with the Website. They allow to identify the sections or functions of the Website to which Users devote the most time, and also help to track how users navigate the Website. Marketing cookies are cookies that are placed to show the most current content for the User based on information about his use of the Website. These cookies may be placed by marketing partners or made available to the User for advertising when they use other websites or platforms. Disabling these cookies does not always reduce the amount of advertising or marketing content viewed — most likely, the User will receive content without taking into account his preferences. Functional cookies are cookies that are placed to optimize interaction with the User, for example, to increase the level of functionality or preserve his preferences for subsequent visits. These cookies also make it possible to use features such as creating an account and subscribing to updates. Strictly necessary cookies are types of cookies that are used by the Website to function properly, for example, to display individual elements on the Website or to ensure the security of the Website. The Administrator cannot disable them, but the User has the option to restrict or prohibit their use at the level of his browser settings. Any restrictions are likely to cause problems when downloading or using the Website. 8.10. Setting up a web browser is a free and efficient way to manage cookies. The User can make one of the following decisions: enable all cookies integrated into pages. Note: on the one hand, only their publishers will have access to these cookies; on the other hand, this process is not irreversible, and subsequently the User can always delete these cookies (the procedure for managing cookies differs depending on the browser used); block cookies on the User’s device. In this case, the User is warned that the Website navigation will be difficult. Some features require the use of cookies (for example, to recognize the operating system and the preferred language of the User). Therefore, the Operator shall not be liable for inconvenience caused by improper operation of the Website’s services due to disconnection of cookies; enable the use of on-demand cookies on a case-by-case basis; accept or reject cookies depending on their publisher. 8.11. The process for enabling or disabling cookies may vary, depending on the web browser you use. More detailed instructions are available from the links below: Internet Explorer; Chrome; Opera; Safari; Firefox. For more information, you need to go to your browser settings. You can also visit thewww.aboutcookies.orgwebsite, which contains information about changing cookie settings in different browsers. Users from the EU can visit thehttp://www.youronlinechoices.comto get useful information about the use of cookies and the protection of their personal data on the Internet, including settings for advertising cookies. 9.1. The Personal Data shall be stored in accordance with the User’s consent within the period specified in the Policy. 9.2. Storage of Personal Data is carried out no longer than the purpose of their processing requires. The Personal Data to be processed shall be destroyed or depersonalized upon achievement of the processing goals or in case of loss of the need to achieve these goals. 9.3. Storage of Personal Data, the purposes of processing of which are different, shall be carried out separately within the framework of the Operator’s information system or, subject to storage on material media, within the scope of the functions of the respective Operator’s subdivision. 9.4. Operator’s employee having access to Personal Data in connection with performance of work duties shall ensure storage of information containing Personal Data, excluding access to them by third parties. In the absence of an employee, documents containing Personal Data should not be at his workplace. In case of vacation, business trip and other cases of long-term absence of the employee at the workplace, he shall transfer documents and other media containing Personal Data to the person who will be entrusted with the performance of such work duties by a local act of the Operator. In case such person is not appointed, documents and other media containing Personal Data of Users shall be transferred to another employee who has access to Personal Data at the direction of the head of the corresponding structural subdivision of the Operator. 9.5. Upon dismissal of an employee who has access to Personal Data, documents and other media containing Personal Data shall be transferred to another employee who has access to Personal Data at the direction of the head of the structural subdivision and with the notification of the data protection supervisor. 10.1.

The user whose rights are affected by the incident shall be informed of the incident by e-mail as soon as possible, but not later than 30 (Thirty) working days after the occurrence of the incident. Within the same period, all possible measures shall be taken to reduce or prevent further damage to the rights of the User. 11.5. The analysis of incidents shall be carried out by the person responsible for processing data from among the Operator’s employees, who for each incident: 11.5.1.

We are working with you to create a place where everyone can share their opinions and personal experiences without fear of being offended in the comments. By becoming a User, you confirm compliance with the following rules: 3.7.1. General overview The official language of communication on Crypto News is the following languages: English, Russian, German, Spanish, and Arabic. The main topic for communication in the community is the crypto industry, blockchain, finance, market analytics, etc. Ignorance of community rules is not an excuse for violations committed. The administration, represented by Crypto News employees, is entitled to make changes to the rules without prior notification to users. Additions and rule changes are effective from the moment they are published. The Crypto News community is predominantly post-moderated, that is, the presence of a specific post or comment in the community does not mean their compliance with the rules. Content can be checked by the administration for compliance with the rules after its publication. The community administration assumes no responsibility for the content of comments from users, but to the best of its ability suppresses breaches. Crypto News provides only a technical opportunity for users to post and share comments. In some cases, pre-publication content may be submitted for preliminary review to the moderator service.
