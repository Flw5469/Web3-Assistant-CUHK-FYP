    "news_content": "This coupon content was created by the WIRED team—we select offers based on what our readers are shopping for and regularly check all posted content to make sure it does what it says it will, because we know how annoying broken promo codes are. When you buy something using these coupons, we may earn a small affiliate commission.Learn more 1051 new deals and promo codes uploaded this week by our Team Perhaps you've seen the viral video explaining the history of Crocs and the 2006 movie Idiocracy, where they made their debut in a dystopian future where the dumb rule the dumber. As the story goes, the wardrobe designer needed silly and distinctive footwear for the Brawndo-swilling denizens to wear during their appearances before the Extreme Court and selected these bulbous foam clogs from a Colorado-based startup. Crocs got popular before the movie was even out of post-pro, demonstrating just how fast the future arrives sometimes. None of this makes me question wearing my blue Crocs—they're comfy, practical and, dare I say, timeless. We've got acurrent Crocs couponfor free shipping and $15 off. —Martin Cizmar WIRED reviewers have had mixed opinions on the wide variety of smart health products from the French brand Withings. We really like theirunderstated and elegant Scanwatch 2 smartwatchbut didn't like their expensive andfinicky smart scale. What we do like, always, is a good deal andstudents saving 10% site-wideon Withings products qualifies. If you're looking to get more activity this summer Withings products can help prod you along. —Martin Cizmar Summer travel season is here, and if you're into the new Millennial trend of \"quiet vacationing\" (read: doing your job but by a resort pool) you're going to want a solid tethering situation. Visible has you covered with their2.0 hotspot, which offers speeds up to three-times as fast as the first version. I am a current Visible customer and while my overall impressions of the company are mixed (and will be revealed in a later guide to the best pre-paid cell service) they have never let me down on tethering and are now one of the only brands offering Apple watch cell service on a prepaid plan, which is reason enough to enroll. —Martin Cizmar Discovering great deals on products they need and want is one of the main things that brings readers to the content created by WIRED's Reviews team, whether it's our round-the-clock coverage of Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day or our quick articles about seasonal sales from Lowe's or REI. In a world where other publishers flood our content with fake discounts or sales on junky products, we pride ourselves on using our deals coverage to feature only products our editors and reviewers really like after personally testing and which are actually discounted below their normal street price. WIRED's Coupons program is part of this work and is our way of providing a place to find incredible deals and first-rate coupon codes for the brands you trust, likeSamsung,Best Buy,AT&T Internet, and more. Our Reviews team vets every vendor and we employ a small team of producers who is constantly checking these codes to make sure they work. Our coupon pages let you shop popular products – faster. Explore categories like technology and electronics, department stores, and more. Simply search for brands on WIRED Coupons using the search bar, copy a coupon code and paste it at checkout. Our commitment is to provide WIRED readers with coupons that offer meaningful discounts on quality products—and most importantly, which can be counted on to work reliably, since we know how annoying it is to plug a code in and see that it's expired or otherwise invalid. WIRED's Reviews team selects the brands we offer coupons from and only works with brands that we trust and which we know are well aligned with the needs and interests of WIRED readers and our other editorial coverage.

    "news_title": "He Helped Invent Generative AI. Now He Wants to Save It | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. In 2016, Google engineer Illia Polosukhin had lunch with a colleague, Jacob Uszkoreit. Polosukhin had been frustrated by a lack of progress in his project, using AI to provide useful answers to questions posed by users, and Uszkoreit suggested he try a technique he had been brainstorming that he called self-attention. Thus began an 8-person collaboration that ultimately resulted in a 2017 paper called “Attention Is All You Need,” whichintroduced the concept of transformersas a way to supercharge artificial intelligence. It changed the world. Eight years later, though, Polosukhin is not completely happy with the way things are shaking out. A big believer in open source, he’s concerned about the secretive nature of transformer-based large language models, even from companies founded on the basis of transparency. (Gee, who can that be?) We don’t know what they’re trained on or what the weights are, and outsiders certainly can’t tinker with them. One giant tech company, Meta, does tout its systems as open source, but Polosukhin doesn’t consider Meta’s models as truly open: “The parameters are open, but we don’t know what data went into the model, and data defines what bias might be there and what kinds of decisions are made,” he says. As LLM technology improves, he worries it will get more dangerous, and that the need for profit will shape its evolution. “Companies say they need more money so they can train better models. Those models will actually be better at manipulating people, and you can tune them better for generating revenue,” he says. Polosukhin has zero confidence that regulation will help. For one thing, dictating limits on the models is so hard that the regulators will have to rely on the companies themselves to get the job done. “I don't think there's that many people who are able to effectively answer questions like, ‘Here's the model parameters, right? Is this a good margin of safety?’ Even for an engineer, it's hard to answer questions about model parameters and what’s a good margin of safety,” he says. “I’m pretty sure that nobody in Washington, DC, will be able to do it.” This makes the industry a prime candidate for regulatory capture. “Bigger companies know how to play the game,” he says. “They'll put their own people on the committee to make sure the watchers are the watchees.” The alternative, argues Polosukhin, is an open source model where accountability is cooked into the technology itself. Even before the transformers paper was published in 2017, Polosukhin had left Google to start a blockchain/Web3 nonprofit called the Near Foundation. Now his company is semi-pivoting to apply some of those principles of openness and accountability to what he calls “user-owned AI.” Using blockchain-based crypto protocols as a model, this approach to AI would be a decentralized structure with a neutral platform. “Everybody would own the system,” he says. “At some point you would say, ‘We don’t have to grow anymore.’ It’s like with bitcoin—the price can go up or down, but there’s no one deciding, ‘Hey, we need to post $2 billion more revenue this year.’ You can use that mechanism to align incentives and build a neutral platform.” According to Polosukhin, developers are already using Near’s platform to develop applications that could work on this open source model. Near has established anincubation programto help startups in the effort. One promising application is a means to distribute micropayments to creators whose content is feeding AI models. I remark to Polosukhin that given its reputation, and Web3’s failure so far to take over the internet, crypto might not be the most reassuring analogy for a movement designed to rein in the most volatile technology of our era. “We do need help with marketing,” he admits. One persistent argument against open source AI is that granting universal access to powerful models might empower bad actors to abuse AI for things like generating misinformation or creating new weapons. Polosukhin says that open systems aren’t really worse than what we have now. “Safety is just a masquerade that limits the functionality of these models,” he says. “All of them are jail-breakable—it’s really not that hard.” Polosukhin has been proselytizing his idea, talking to scientists around the industry, including some of his “Attention” coauthors. Among the latter, he has found the most resonance from Uszkoreit, with whom he shared that fateful meal in 2016. Uszkoreit, whom I spoke with this week, agrees with much of Polosukhin’s argument, though he isn’t enamored of the moniker. Instead of “user-owned AI,” he’d prefer “community-owned AI.” He is particularly excited that an open source approach, perhaps with the micropayment system Polosukhin envisions, might provide a way to resolve the tough intellectual property crisis that AI has triggered. The giant companies are now engaged in an epic legal battle with creators whose work is at the heart of their AI models. Since those companies are relentlessly profit-driven, that conflict is built in, and even if they make efforts to compensate creators, those would inevitably be affected by their need to ultimately capture the most value for themselves. That would not be the case with a model built from scratch with the idea of recognizing and rewarding such contributions. “All these questions about IP would go away if we had a way of actually recognizing the contributions of content creators,” says Uszkoreit. “For the very first time in history, we have an opportunity to quantify what the value of a piece of information is, at least over longer periods of time, to humanity.” One question I have about the user-owned approach is where the money might come from to develop a sophisticated foundation model from scratch. Right now, Polosukhin’s platform makes use of a version of Meta’s Llama model, despite his reservations. Who would put up a billion bucks to create a totally open model? Maybe some government? A giant GoFundMe? Uszkoreit speculates maybe a tech company just below the top tier might go for it just to thwart the competition. It isn’t clear. But both Polosukhin and Uszkoreit are certain that if user-owned AI doesn’t appear before the world gets artificial general intelligence—the point where superintelligent AI begins improving AI itself—a disaster will be upon us. If that happens, Uszkoreit says, “we’re screwed.” Both he and Polosukhin think it’s inevitable that AI scientists will create intelligence that is smart enough to improve itself. If the current situation persists, it will probably be a big tech company. “Then you get this runaway effect where suddenly a few corporations, or maybe the one that gets it first, ends up with a money-printing machine that ultimately creates a zero-sum game that sucks the air out of the economy, and that we can't let happen.” Does Polosukhin, when contemplating worst-case scenarios, ever have second thoughts on his role in leveling up AI? Not really. “Whichever breakthrough happened, would have happened with or without us, maybe at a different time,” he says. “For us to continue evolving, we do need to have a different structure, and that's what I'm working on. If user-owned AI exists, it levels the playing field, and OpenAI and Google and the others are not able to become monopolists—they would be playing the same game, on the same field. It evens out the risks and the opportunities.” You might even call it … transformative. Earlier this year, I wrote about how the authors of the “Attention Is All You Need” paper invented transformers. The breakthrough helped ignite the generative AI movement. A deceptively random conversation between Polosukhin and Uszkoreit was a key moment in what became a historic achievement of thefateful eight Googlers—all of whom have now left the company. One day in 2016, Uszkoreit was having lunch in a Google café with a scientist named Illia Polosukhin. Born in Ukraine, Polosukhin had been at Google for nearly three years. He was assigned to the team providing answers to direct questions posed in the search field. It wasn’t going all that well. “To answer something on Google.com, you need something that’s very cheap and high-performing,” Polosukhin says. “Because you have milliseconds” to respond. When Polosukhin aired his complaints, Uszkoreit had no problem coming up with a remedy. “He suggested, why not use self-attention?” says Polosukhin. Polosukhin sometimes collaborated with a colleague named Ashish Vaswani. Born in India and raised mostly in the Middle East, he had gone to the University of Southern California to earn his doctorate in the school’s elite machine translation group. Afterward, he moved to Mountain View to join Google—specifically a newish organization calledGoogle Brain. He describes Brain as “a radical group” that believed “neural networks were going to advance human understanding.” But he was still looking for a big project to work on. His team worked in Building 1965 next door to Polosukhin’s language team in 1945, and he heard about the self-attention idea. Could that be the project? He agreed to work on it. Together, the three researchers drew up a design document called “Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks.” They picked the name “transformers” from “day zero,” Uszkoreit says. The idea was that this mechanism would transform the information it took in, allowing the system to extract as much understanding as a human might—or at least give the illusion of that. Plus Uszkoreit had fond childhood memories of playing with the Hasbro action figures. “I had two little Transformer toys as a very young kid,” he says. The document ended with a cartoony image of six Transformers in mountainous terrain, zapping lasers at one another. There was also some swagger in the sentence that began the paper: “We are awesome.” You can read thefull feature here. Dileep asks, “How do you think students can best use the available AI tools, and how can professors best teach them how to use them? I am encouraging tools such as ChatGPT to help them get a leg up. But they are using it where it is perfectly evident to anyone reading that they have used ChatGPT.” Thanks for the question Dileep, and also for providing some context. You told me that you teach at a school where many students are from immigrant families and are working to fund their education. It seems you are struggling with the question of whether using generative AI as a shortcut to adequate work is helping them “get a leg up,” as you say, or providing a deceptive impression that they have mastered a genuine skill. Let’s put aside the uses of ChatGPT to do information-gathering tasks like presenting a big picture on a subject or summarizing long texts—these don’t seem too controversial. (I would say, however, that actually interacting directly with source material provides a deeper understanding that pays off in the long run.) The question for our times is how much students should rely on generative AI toproducetheir work. In one sense, it’s a repeat of the old argument over whether using calculators to do math work is cheating. The counterargument is that in the real world people no longer have to work things out on paper, and it is ridiculous to pretend that isn’t the case. That latter approach has won the day. But writing essays based on research and logic is a different situation. Organizing one’s research and presenting it as an argument is an effective way to train the mind to think empirically. Persuasive writing requires you to consider a skeptical reader’s point of view, and forces you to present arguments that are backed by evidence, in a succinct and powerful way. Mastering that skill hones your own mind. One can make the argument that ChatGPT and other products might ultimately negate the need to write essays, as if those LLMs were calculators for prose. But the idea isn’t to provide a bunch of words for some teacher to read—it’s to struggle through whatever process trains a mind to think logically and empathetically. So the problem isn't that ChatGPT essays are mediocre. Even if the output was fantastic, the fact would remain that there is minimal educational value in this shortcut. If your students want “a leg up” in the world, they must do the difficult work of marshaling their evidence, mastering logic, and expressing those thoughts coherently. This will put them in good stead for everything they do in the workplace and beyond. For some of them this will be really difficult—I used to teach freshman composition at a state school and have seen what a challenge it can be. Also, it will be really hard for you to convince them to ditch this magical new prosthesis called ChatGPT. But the payoff will be worth it. You can submit questions tomail@wired.com.

    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Can you imagine what a digital white ethnostate or a cyber caliphate might look like? Having spent most of my career on the inside of online extremist movements, I certainly can. The year 2024 might be the one in which neo-Nazis, jihadists, and conspiracy theorists turn their utopian visions of creating their own self-governed states into reality—not offline, but in the form of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs are digital entities that are collaboratively governed without central leadership and operate based on blockchain. They allow internet users to establish their own organizational structures, which no longer require the involvement of a third party in financial transactions and rulemaking. The World Economic Forumdescribed DAOsas “an experiment to reimagine how we connect, collaborate and create”. However, as with all new technologies, there is also a darker side to them: They are likely to give rise to new threats emerging from decentralized extremist mobilization. Today, there are already over 10,000 DAOs, which collectively manage billions of dollars and count millions of participants. So far, DAOs have attracted a wild mix of libertarians, activists, pranksters, and hobbyists. Most DAOs I have come across in my research sound innocent and fun. Personally, my favorites include theCaféDAO, which aims “to replace Starbucks” (good luck with that!); the Doge DAO, which wants to “make the Doge meme the most recognizable piece of art in the world”; and the HairDAO, “a decentralized asset manager solving hair loss.” But some DAOs use a more radical tone. For example, the Redacted Club DAO, which is rife with alt-right codes and conspiracy myth references, claims to be a secret network with the aim of “slaying” the “evil Meta Lizard King.” This story is from theWIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the serieshere—ordownloada copy of the magazine. The year 2024 might be one in which extremists start using DAOs strategically. Policies, legal contracts, and financial transactions that were traditionally the domain of governments, courts, and banks can be replaced with smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and cryptocurrencies. The use of anonymous bitcoin wallets and non-transparent cryptocurrencies such as Monero is already widespread among extremists whose bank accounts have been frozen. A shift to entirely decentralized forms of self-governance is only one step away. Beyond practical reasons that encourage extremists to create their own self-governed structures, there is an ideological incentive too: their fundamental distrust in the establishment. If you believe that the deep state or the “global Jewish elites” control everything from governments and Big Tech to the global banking system, DAOs offer an appealing alternative. Conversations on far-right fringe platforms such as BitChute and Odysee reveal that there is much appetite for decentralized alternative forms of collaboration, communication, and crowdfunding. So what happens if anti-minority groups establish their own digital worlds in which they impose their own governing mechanisms? What are the stakes if trolling armies start cooperating via DAOs to launch election interference campaigns? The activities of extremist DAOs could challenge the rule of law, pose a threat to minority groups, and disrupt institutions that are currently considered fundamental pillars of democratic systems. Another risk is that DAOs can serve as safe havens for extremist movements by enabling users to circumvent government regulation and security services monitoring activities. They might also allow extremists to find new ways to fundraise, plan, and plot radicalization campaigns or even attacks. While many governments have focused on developing legal frameworks to regulate AI, few have even recognized the existence of DAOs. Their looming exploitation for extremist and criminal purposes is something that has flown under the radar of global policymakers. Technology expert Carl Miller, who has long warned of potential misuse of DAOs, told me that “even though DAOs behave like companies, they are not registered as legal entities.” There are only a few exceptions: The US states of Wyoming, Vermont, and Tennessee have passed laws to legally recognize DAOs. With no regulations in place to hold DAOs accountable for extremist or criminal activities, the big question for 2024 will be: How can we ensure the metaverse doesn’t give rise to digital white ethnostates or cyber caliphates?

HTC and Sony are just about clinging on by their fingertips. And yet the ultra-niche Vertu just recently announced a phone as bold and bombastic as anything it has made to date: theMetavertu. Itstartsat £2,787 ($3,330), then tops out at a mind-boggling £34,534 ($41,262) for theborderline offensiveHimalaya Alligator Leather 18K Gold & Diamond model. And that may not even be the most eye-opening part: Vertu markets this thing as the “world’s first Web3 phone,” a claim that would set off alarm bells had they not already been ringing since first sight of the Vertu name. Why? Over the years, Vertu has been responsible for some of the mosttastelessandgaudyphones to roll off a production line. However, it started off as a Nokia side brand in 1998. Those early years gave us some undeniably striking phones, like the relatively elegantVertu Signaturefrom 2003. By 2012, Nokia’s phone market share had dropped from heights of 50.8 percent to under 5 percent. Vertu was sold to aprivate equity group, then bouncedbetween ownersfrom Turkey and China. This period saw a handful of handset designs that could be compared to handbags that hang around season after season in TJ Maxx stores (“TK Maxx” if you’re outside of the US). There was a great deal of rampantly embossed leather and contours. Almost all Vertu phones have been criticized for their outdated tech and sky-high pricing. They are, and always have been, phones for people with more money than taste or sense. Vertu's Metavertu “Alligator Leather Flame Red”—yours for £5,408. However, the Vertu Metavertu feels quite different. It is a legit high-performance phone, and while the base design is pedestrian and some of its specs are slightly past their prime, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, components available at the phone’s October 2022 launch were notdrasticallybetter. The MetaVertu has a bold OLED screen and a responsive triple rear cameras that included a powerful 5x zoom. Its stereo speakers are loud, and just lack a little of the bass impact of the very best. My Metavertu review sample has 1 TB of storage and an almost over-the-top 18 GB of DDR5 RAM. It even comes with a tempered glass screen protector attached, perfectly matching the slick curved glass of the display—even top-end phones use basic plastic protectors, if they have one at all. Surprisingly, this feels like a true flagship Android in a way no Vertu phone really has since the pre-iPhone era. But to look at Vertu as a company in 2023, it all makes very little sense. The company address that Vertu lists on its homepage is that of a single room on the fifth floor of an office block in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Search for it online and you’ll also find an accountancy firm, a furniture exporter, an advertising agency, and a toy company all registered to the same “room 505.” Back in the old days, one of the key selling points of a Vertu phone was that it was “made in England.” The handsets were assembled at a small factory in Church Crookam, a village next to Fleet, in Hampshire, about 90 minutes’ drive from London. However, that factory was demolished in 2020 to make way for asupermarket. According to Google Street View, you’ll find Aldi and Home Bargains in the spot where Vertu’s old headquarters stood. Vertu’s days at that factory did not end well. “Here was a tech business where one day their landlords came into the HQ—the factory you mentioned—and took away the toilet rolls, as they had not paid their bills,” says a source who worked with the brand for many years. “The business collapsed, owing £65 million ($80 million) and laying off 200 staff,” they told us. WIRED was unable to independently verify these numbers; however, at the time, the BBC andDaily Telegraphnewspaper reported that the money Vertu owed was even higher, at£128 million. While Vertu may still have “Vertu England” on its Facebook posts, the brand has nothing to do with the UK anymore, besides trying to flog phones to the occasional rich person there. But if Vertu went bankrupt rather catastrophically in 2017, how is it alive today, with the sameGodin Holdingsfigure, Gary Chen (or Chen Gang), at its head giving the new phone's launch presentation in 2022? The Metavertu has at least 10 references to ZTE in the phone’s hardware tags. A closer look at the phone reveals some clues. Hardware data scraper app Device Info uncovered at least 10 references to ZTE in the phone’s hardware tags—the cameras, the battery, the “builder” tag, and more. ZTE is a phone manufacturer known for both its own phones and ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) models, where a brand partners with a manufacturer in order to make use of their existing factories and supply chains. You provide the design specifics, they crank out the units. This was how phone networks like Vodafone made own-brand handsets. If the handset is made by ZTE, perhaps this is the only way making the Metavertu could have been viable, particularly as a smartphone likely to sell in tiny numbers? “Vertu has changed hands lots of over the past decade, but is still being run by a bunch of folks based out of Hong Kong, very close to the Chinese supply chain,” says Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research. “These folks with renewed focus are rebadging existing models from brands—ZTE, for example—with luxury materials and advanced hardware and software.” Take another look at the Metavertu with this in mind, and you’ll find it looks very similar to theZTE Nubia Z40 Profrom early 2022. They have eerily similar camera sensors, lens and flash placement, processor, and display specs, and even share a red accented power button on the side. From the front they look nearly identical. Slap an expensive carbon fiber, ceramic, and sapphire backplate on the £500 to £800 Nubia Z40 Pro, and you’ll get a Metavertu, more or less. And if this Basic Carbon Fiber £2,915 ($3,592) design doesn’t do it for you—looking, as it does, a little like an Asus ROG gaming phone—why not upgrade to thered alligator leatherversion for a mere £6,073 ($7,464)? The Metavertu is no ordinary phone, for sure, but it would seem someone else has had a hand in the “creating extraordinary” factor you’ll see mentioned on Vertu's self-aggrandizing lock-screen images. This all leaves Vertu’s software as potentially the more substantive draw of the Metavertu experience. And given it is supposedly the “world’s first Web3 phone,” that makes sense. “The positioning is ‘geek luxury’—completely different versus the ‘fashion luxury’ of older Vertu phones,” says Shah. Classic Vertu models came with a concierge service, which was outsourced to a third-party company. The Metavertu still has a concierge of sorts, but this time it’s in the shape of hotel, air ticket, and restaurant reservation forms that quite literally link you to a Google Sheets page inside a Vertu Life app. The process is much like booking directly on a website for yourself, but is sure to put hackles up about privacy and security. Or at least it should. Alternatively, you can call the “concierge line” phone number, but this is exactly the same generic customer service number found published on Vertu’s own website. Luxury service, indeed. Still, the concierge service is old news. It’s not Web3; it’s not even Web 2.0. But what is a Web3 phone? Many of you may be wondering whatWeb3 even means. The term Web3 refers to technologies such as cryptocurrencies, ideas of turning video games into commodities marketplaces (more than they currently are), and pretty much anything to do with the blockchain. Now, Web3 has interesting potential and is a honeypot for venture capital investment, but is also replete with opportunists ready and willing to exploit the credulous. This VC clientele chimes with Vertu’s approach. “The target market seems to be tech investors, investment bankers, crypto buffs, and so forth,” says Shah of the Metavertu’s seemingly ideal customer. Vertu owner Gary Chen played this angle hard at the phone’s London launch at the end of last year, which was attended by many crypto enthusiasts and fashion types, and barely any technology reporters. He spouted seemingly-endless meandering twaddle about Web3 while at one point even misrepresented the phone itself. Contrary to the company head’s claims, for example, the Metavertu does have Google Play access. Web3 lives in the Metavertu as a stack of custom apps that range from the prosaic to the bizarre. They all sit in a password-protected Meta Space base app, which claims to be encrypted. You input a password to enter it, like a “secure”-file-store app you may have tried before. Inside, there’s a place to store your crypto wallet details, called Value. Vbox offers cloud storage. Dappstore is an app store that is, at the time of writing, empty aside from Vertu’s own stuff and a few web shortcuts posing as apps. Venture is a custom web browser whose homepage is stacked with crypto links, and VShot is a camera app that lets you “mint” up to five images a day. This last one is sure to pick up some attention. Minting typically refers to the creation of anNFT. A phone that mints NFTs? That’s the dream (for some). However, while Vertu calls this an NFT camera, it appears to primarily be a way of proving copyright ownership by linking the file to a unique ID (DID). It’s not clear whether there’s any blockchain action going on here. Why can’t we tell you definitively? Vertu demands you supply not just your real name and either your drivers license number or passport number to use Vshot, but a picture of its information page and a picture of you holding your ID. You’re left waiting up to five minutes with the load bar spinning before you’ll see this bizarre info request, too. If this doesn’t make you worried, it should. Vertu’s terms of service claims this ID is required by the People’s Republic of China, and goes on to leave one with the impression that maybe you shouldn’t bet the bank on any “due diligence” from Vertu in checking the apps made available through the Dapp store, among other worrying clauses. The entire poorly written script doesn’t quite reach the levels of “if you use this software, you are on your own should something go wrong,” but let’s just say it isverydifferent from the T+Cs pages you'd expect from any “normal\" app store. We’re certainly not in the Google Play Store anymore. Never before have I used a phone where I felt so unsafe, one that feels like itcouldbe used to scam me—though, to be clear, I have no evidence that it is. This really is a Web3 phone, then, just perhaps not in the sense the aspiring crypto bros hoped for. If you’re about to dismiss this as anti-Web3 paranoia, just wait a minute. Right now at least two versions of Vertu exist online. There’s theVertuthat makes the Metavertu, based in Hong Kong and China, andVertu AK France. Vertu AK France accuses the current Chinese incarnation of Vertu of “massive accounting and financial fraud”on its website, and claims to be the “real” Vertu online while selling classic Vertu handsets that must have been manufactured years ago. Vertu AK France is not your classic underdog, though. It is owned by Hakan Uzan, a man exiled from Turkey amid fraud investigations that led to219 companiesunder the Uzan umbrella being seized, and his brotherCem Uzanbeing sentenced in absentia to 23 years in prison for racketeering. Members of the Uzan family have been living in France, having been granted political asylum. In 2021, Hakan and Cem Uzanattempted to sueVodafone, Motorola, BlackRock, and other entities for a combined $68 billion for those assets seized almost two decades prior. The Metavertu “Basic” Carbon Fiber handset and the flagship Himalaya Alligator Leather 18K Gold & Diamonds model, which costs £34,534. WIRED contacted Vertu AK France in an attempt for clarification. Vertu AK France did not respond. We asked Vertu in Hong Kong to provide proof of ownership and explain how both itandVertu AK France could claim to own the Vertu brand. In response, Vertu Hong Kong gave us documentation appearing to show that it has owned the trademark for the name “Vertu\" in more than 40 countries but notably not in France. This leaves Vertu in the position where two companies are claiming ownership of the brand, each accusing the other of substantial fraud. Metavertu’s luxury facade is a fragile illusion, and the Vertu story just gets weirder the closer you look. As pleasant as the Metavertu is to use, we do not want to hand over our passport details just to use its questionable software features, and you shouldn’t either.

    "news_title": "Molly White Tracks Crypto Scams. It’s Going Just Great\n| WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. As cryptocurrencies riseand fall, there’s one number that just keeps going up. Whenever somebody loses money to a crypto scam or hack, the Grift Counter on Molly White’s blog,Web3 Is Going Just Great, spins higher and higher. Recently it ticked over $12 billion. White started the blog in December 2021 out of frustration with the mainstream coverage of crypto, which she says paid too much attention to rags-to-riches tales and not enough to its dark underbelly. Her goal was to paint a fuller picture, to chronicle the thefts and failures, debunk the marketing spiel, and underline the risks in the process. A software engineer by trade, White codedWeb3 Is Going Just Greatover the span of a few weeks. It was only a side project, designed to “entertain me and me alone,” says White; she never imagined it would gain any traction. But within a few months, the blog had become a viral hit, earning White a reputation as an authoritative crypto pundit. When she first learned about crypto at a conference in college in the early 2010s, White admired the pro-privacy and anti-censorship principles on which it was founded. She was enthusiastic, she says, about its potential to shield dissidents and whistleblowers from financial surveillance and to help women confined to abusive relationships by financial dependence. However, by the time crypto reappeared on White’s radar a decade later, those ideas had been all but erased—replaced with an emphasis on maximizing personal profit. Online, the rocket ship emoji was being cast about as an instrument of hype, and “no coiners” were being told to “have fun staying poor,” as record numbers of people were drawn into crypto. As a result, examples of the technology being used for good are “eclipsed” by the number of people who have lost money, says White. “It’s moving the web and society in a really negative direction.” When White startedWeb3 Is Going Just Great, crypto was on a hot streak and people were making a lot of money, which meant she found herself “raining on the parade of people who weren’t willing to be rained on,” she says. Threats, slurs, and personal insults began to tumble into her inbox. As a long-time Wikipedia editor, White had experienced abuse before, including threats of doxing and violence toward family members over entries she had authored on the American far right. Nonetheless, it still “really sucks,” she says. “That’s why this type of behavior happens: to discourage people from being critical. A lot of people decide it’s not worth it.” But in 2022, White and her fellow critics had their moment. A calamitous year for crypto was punctuated by a series of collapses, each dealing a cumulative blow to trust in the sector. In May, the failure of the Terra Luna stablecoin prompted a chain reaction that took down hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, crypto lender Celsius, and others. In November came the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, whose founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been charged with 12 criminal offenses, including fraud and money laundering. White says she felt somewhat vindicated by what happened, but that “it’s not a good feeling” because regular people lost billions of dollars. At best, the fallout acted as a “useful example” of the risks White had been trying to highlight—examples she hopes policy makers will take heed of. In the wake of the FTX collapse, efforts to regulate the crypto industry have received increased attention. The chief goals are to prevent people from losing money to fraudulent projects and to give legitimate crypto businesses a clear set of boundaries within which to operate. White, who gave a statement in July to the US Treasury’s Financial Stability Oversight Council, says the events of last year will help politicians realize that crypto is not something that can be simply ignored. Although she is “not necessarily optimistic” about the trajectory of efforts to regulate the industry, because of the strength of the crypto lobby, White hopes her work can still make a difference. Occasionally, White resents the obligation to think, write, and speak about crypto when she could instead be doing something that drives in a positive direction.

    "news_title": "Adam Mosseri Says He Wants Big Tech to Give Up Control | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Another day, anothercryptocurrency meltdown. Even the most ardent blockchain boosters will admit that the vast majority of what WIRED recently called the “flashing-neon crypto casino” of memecoins, NFT drops, and DeFi projects will ultimately gopoofand take almost everyone’s money with it. The question we’ve been trying to answer in our journalism is: What is the tiny percentage that will remain and be actually useful? In a TED talk last month, whichwent online today, Instagram boss Adam Mosseri offered what felt, at first blush at least, like one of the more compelling answers. One much-touted promise of Web3 is that it will let ordinary internet users truly own their data—and store it on a blockchain no single entity controls, instead of having it harvested and monetized by giant tech companies. Most examples of how this would work have been pretty abstract up to now, but Mosseri offered more specifics by describing how content creators—musicians, writers, artists, vloggers, and the like—might use Web3 to gain a measure of independence from dominant platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and yes, even Instagram. In Mosseri’s vision, a hypothetical country-music singer called Lisa sells her fans subscriptions, not to Facebook or YouTube or TikTok, but to herself. She issues tokens on a blockchain that give the bearer access to all her music wherever it lives online. The platforms still host the music, but they no longer control Lisa’s relationship with her subscribers. They can’t decide what data she sees, sell her subscribers’ data to third parties, or suddenly hike their cut of her income. If she decides to stop using a platform—or if the platform itself kicks her off, or goes bust—she doesn’t lose her subscriber list. In the talk, Mosseri said this would mark “a dramatic shift in power away from platforms like [Instagram] and to … creators.” He also hypothesized that creators could use this method as a form of equity crowdfunding—whipping up investment early on in their careers from fans who would get a share of their income later. But how will this work in practice? How much independence would Lisa really gain—and what would she lose? And why would giant companies like the one Mosseri works for agree to give up their power? We caught up with him after the talk and asked him to flesh out his vision—which, he conceded, is “less likely to happen than it is not to happen.” This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. WIRED: The idea that you're proposing epitomizes one of the central promises of Web3, which is to give people control over their data. It sounds very enticing for content creators, but all the platforms would have to agree to it. Why would it be in their best interest, and what would make them cede that control? Adam Mosseri:I'm not sure that they will. But let me clarify—the idea [of sharing data] is not just about portable subscriptions. Every platform has an interest for the creator ecosystem to be built on a stable financial base. I don't think it is right now. There are a lot of creators out there. They make money by way of a jerry-rigged group of tools. Over the long run, you want to see more stability and an economic foundation for the creator ecosystem. I think platforms will be giving up some short-term control for there to be a larger pie in the long run. A big risk is the size of the market for subscriptions. Is there going to be a meaningful opportunity for a million creators, for 10 million creators, 50 million creators? On the internet, everyone's famous to 15 people. Exactly. How much could that affect business for a platform like YouTube, or Instagram for that matter? They are selling ads based on people's views. You have to differentiate between the platform subscription and the creator subscription. So my idea would be for a subset of creators to use platforms like YouTube and Instagram to build up a brand and demand for what they do. They could post to whatever platform they want, and give away however much they want for free. But they would also have a group of people who subscribe to them, and that relationship is built in a way that no platform can take it away. At TED you talked about freeing people from the tyranny of platforms and giving them control of their data. Facebook, now Meta, has fought that idea for years, notably when itrefused to participatein Open Social, the proposed alliance where people would have ownership of their contacts and friend connections. Do you acknowledge that 180-degree turn? I definitely acknowledge that historical tension. There's a fundamental tension between a centralized platform [like ours] and decentralized technologies like blockchain. And I acknowledge the potential between our position on things like Open Social, and things like the subscription idea, but I'm not saying everything should be interoperable, or that all data should flow from platform to platform. There are very real reasons for that, privacy being paramount. So does this mean Meta will be willing to let people take their connections and favorites with them? I'm talking specifically about financial relationships. That's a case where the benefits are significant and the costs [to Meta] are less significant. There might be others too, I don't know. I don't have any that I want to say on the record, and I have yet to think about them a bit more. There's a tension there. But the world is changing. The greatest risk a platform faces is not competition, though competition is a huge risk. It is that the world changes to make what you do irrelevant because you are not willing to lean in and change along with the world. And we've seen that for many large companies in many industries. So yeah, this is a different approach than we have historically taken. That just shows that we're open to embracing where the world is going. You are tying these changes to a blockchain-based system. But what stopped previous cross-platform initiatives was not the technology but the refusal of companies to work together. If everyone agrees to do your idea now, why do you need to use the blockchain? In this case, the blockchain makes sense because blockchains are immutable. The record is public and available to everyone forever, so we literally cannot delete the thing. That gives weight to the assurance that we cannot take this [subscriber] relationship away from you. Yes, we could absolutely build this on non-blockchain technologies using something like OAuth. But the assurances would carry less weight at a time where trust in institutions has declined. So you're saying that you could have done it earlier, but it was good to wait for blockchain because no one would have believed you otherwise? I'm not saying that. But there is a truth to that framing. It has less to do with blockchain and more to do with competition in the market for creators, and us feeling a sense of urgency for being the de facto platform for them. Instagram specifically has enjoyed immense market fit with creators for a very long time. Now, a lot of other platforms have wised up to the value of creators. As more power shifted from institutions to individuals, the competition for creators and creators' business has exploded. And it has created a strong incentive for us to do way more to help creators make a living directly, as opposed to indirectly. Traditionally, creators build an audience, and they monetize that audience. Branded content on Instagram is probably a $15 billion industry, roughly—I don't know, many billions of dollars. Now we're building more ways for creators to make a living. So we announced the first test of NFTs this week, performed tests around affiliate marketing, experimented with revenue sharing and longer-form video. We launched subscriptions, which we are still testing. “If we agree with those who say we shouldn't build anything new as long as anything bad ever happens on Instagram, then we're never going to build anything new ever again.” Let's talk about your hypothetical country singer, Lisa. She sells a subscription to her content on all platforms as blockchain tokens. But pretty much every major use of a blockchain also requires some other intermediary services: Lisa probably wants software that connects transactions to a list of actual subscribers so she can grant them access to her content. And maybe she needs a CRM, and maybe she needs analytics. And she also still depends on the platforms themselves to distribute her content. Their algorithms can boost or suppress her stuff, or take it off, or the platforms can go bust. So isn't Lisa just as beholden to centralized platforms as before, and in some ways even worse off? She doesn't necessarily have control over everything, but she's on the hook for everything. I strongly disagree with the characterization at the end. But I agree with everything before that. In this world, yes, she has dependencies. But the idea here is that she has options, and she can move without losing her community. For instance, she could swap payment providers, she could move platforms—if she gets kicked off Twitter, she could start using YouTube, and she would still maintain all the relationships with all her subscribers. Yes, there's an expectation that her subscribers have of her, but she has way more independence. I would also point out that subscribers can vote with their pocket, so if she doesn't produce good content, they will stop paying, presumably. That's actually a healthy incentive. Blockchain is a public record of transactions. Theoretically, it's anonymous, but if somebody wants to badly enough, they could probably figure out who your subscribers are. If it's country music subscribers, it probably doesn't matter. But if Lisa makes BDSM videos, or has a radical political newsletter, that's different. Also, Lisa's competitors might find it useful to know who's subscribing to her or how many subscribers she has. How does she protect that information? There are a bunch of really interesting privacy implications and trade-offs about what you store on the publicly accessible blockchain. Maybe it's anonymized and hashed, but it's publicly accessible, so you can count the number of subscribers. It's going to be one of the more interesting things as we try to design this system, in collaboration with the community. You're pointing out a potential downside. There's always the risk that something gets implemented improperly. But I think a world where you might be able to get more fans because you can move from platform to platform outweighs the downside of people knowing how many subscribers you have. I'm not trying to pretend there are no downsides. This idea is clearly less likely to happen than it is not to happen. But it would be amazing if it happened, and I think we should be taking swings like this. I'm sure some critics will note that while you're talking about blockchain and NFTs, Instagram still has tremendous challenges in content moderation, and its algorithms radicalize people against their wishes. We can work on more than one thing at once. Yes, we have responsibilities to keep people safe, and to be thoughtful about algorithmic responsibility. But we also have a responsibility to deliver value to the people who use Instagram, whether they be creators or average folk. Safety is incredibly important, but if we agree with those who say we shouldn't build anything new as long as anything bad ever happens on Instagram, then we're never going to build anything new ever again. With well over a billion people on our platform, even if we were an order of magnitude better, something bad will happen to someone somewhere. That is the harsh reality of what it means to be a large platform. Your vision doubles down on creator content, and presumably will become more of the Instagram experience. But what about the poor schmoes who aren’t “creators” but just want to share things with their friends? Would they get driven out when your algorithm prioritizes the attention-getting behavior that comes from broadening monetization from sponsors to creators? Friends are always going to be an important part of using Instagram. We're going to continue to value friend content very highly in Feed and Stories, but they're never going to drive most of the time spent on the platform. The most interesting opportunity for us is to be at the intersection of friends and creators, where people can discover things to talk about with their friends. I'm making a huge push to shift more of our ranking toward what we call “exploration-based ranking methodologies” to try and help you discover new things to do. We haven't been good at this historically. By far the leader in creative monetization has been YouTube, and by far the leader on finding new talent has been TikTok. That's something that I want to correct. It sounds as if you're more excited about this new model of monetization than targeting ads to users, which is the entire underlying business model of Facebook and Instagram. No, they're both valuable. The benefit of an advertising-based business model is that you can provide a free service to over a billion people worldwide. Some people use it to stay in touch with loved ones, other people use it to make a living, or at least to just pass the time. All of those things are valuable. That doesn't mean I don't like subscriptions as a business. Both business models have merit. What’s the time frame for these things? It's going to take a long time. I'd be pumped if something like this happened in a few years. As for the investing-in-people idea thatI outlined in the talk, I'd be pumped if it happens in six or seven years at scale. I think it's more likely 10 years.

    "news_title": "What Web3 Can Learn From Archive of Our Own | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Kenzie Carpenter firstdecided to choose a Fannish Next-of-Kin when an online friend, whom she knew as XT, died suddenly. “I had met her in a small, tight-knitDiscordserver for our shared fandom,” she says. “Her death was a shock to all of us.” FNOK arrangements allow users of the popular fan-fiction website Archive of Our Own todesignateanother fan to take control of their works—things like fan fiction, fan art, essays, and videos—after they die. Carpenter had heard of the policy before, but it was XT’s death—and the suggestion from a fellow server member that they all consider naming a FNOK—that spurred her into action. AO3remains an outlier in Carpenter’s digital life: She has no such arrangements on other platforms, partly because none of them have a feature that lets you easily leave your posts in the hands of a like-minded friend. “If more sites had the functionality AO3 has and a similarly simple process, I would probably set something up just to make it easier on my spouse,” she says, clarifying that he does have access to her computer and she trusts him with her online presence. It’s now common practice to leave a “social media will” with login information and postmortem wishes, but without one, immediate family members or people legally designated to act on behalf of an estate are often the only ones who can control a deceased user’s online accounts. Generally, that just means taking a profile down, since most platforms will not grant access to anyone but the user. Some platforms, notably Facebook and Instagram, allow non-family members to “memorialize” a profile; Facebooknow also permitsusers to designate a “legacy contact” who can do things like change their profile photo or put up a remembrance post after they’ve died. The things you’ve bought or earned online can’t be passed on after death—on a gaming platform like Steam, for example, you are licensing the right to use the software, and that right isnon-transferable. Most platforms have little to say about the contentcreatedby the deceased—perhaps because most platforms are in the business of signing up and retaining users, not preserving the things those users have created. In most sites’ terms of service, an individual holds the copyright to their content while licensing the platform to use it; when a person dies, that copyright passes to their heirs, just like with any other type of media. Regardless of ownership, that content usually remains untouched, if it stays online at all; one notable exception isTwitch, where the people running a streamer’s accountcan keep posting for themafter they die.TikTok, arguably the biggest well of content creation on the web in 2023, has no publicly-listed postmortem policies at all. Fans spend time on all of these platforms, but for a lot of them, immediate family members would be less-than-ideal stewards of the works they’ve created. Fandom can be a space to explore things you might not share with people in your non-fandom life—sexual and gender identities, for example, or maybe just weird rabbit holes that only make sense to fellow fans. Without context, fanworks might not seem like something worth preserving—a problem that long predates the web. Many fanzines and other collections have been lost forever; as theFannish Estate Planningarticle on the communal wiki Fanlore puts it, family members of deceased fans often “have no idea what they are looking at, and sadly, much fannish material ends up in the trash and other inglorious destinations.” When AO3 was being built a decade and a half ago, many of the site’s creators had already lost fandom friends—and as a result, they’d also lost their friends’ fanworks. “FNOKs were brought up very early on, as they were starting to discuss what sorts of things they wanted in the terms of service,” says Heather Smith, AO3’s policy and abuse committee cochair and primary FNOK facilitator. “People also had the question of how their own works would be handled after they were gone, so the OTW [the Organization for Transformative Works, AO3’s parent organization] wanted some sort of arrangement that would benefit both creators and fans.” Though FNOK set-up is straightforward, only a small fraction of the site’s millions of users have put one in place. “We hope that an FNOK arrangement is something users take seriously, that both people in an arrangement trust each other a lot and have talked about the possible future of becoming incapacitated together,” Smith says. But, she adds, “I think the majority of our users will never decide to set one up.” Smith herself created one when she joined the FNOK team in 2020—a year that saw a significant increase in requests. “Covid-19seemed to have put that possibility at the forefront of everyone’s minds,” she says. “For me, it helped make the conversation easier to bring up. Everyone had thought about it at least once that year, and it was a small relief to know my existence on the Archive would be handled by someone I trusted.” FNOK arrangements are one of several ways AO3 users’ creations can be preserved independently of the user. Nearly half a million of the site’s 10-million-plus works have been “orphaned,” remaining online but severed from the account that posted them. Orphaning is an act of permanence on a web full of broken links and abandoned profiles, deliberately putting the work in the hands of the Archive itself. Both features create a sense of the platform as a communally constructed space—one that’s built to outlast any individual. This stands in contrast to the increasingly precarious feel of a lot of our digital platforms. From the slow, occasionally chaotic decline of Twitter to the ever-expanding detritus left behind from earlier eras of the web, the connections we make online and the places where we put our creations can feel ephemeral, subject to the whims of corporations or ultrarich individuals. Even with her affairs in order on the AO3, Carpenter feels this acutely in the rest of her digital life. “I’m constantly terrified that Automattic will suddenly decide Tumblr’s not worth it and shut it down overnight, and my past 11 years on the site will be erased in the flip of a switch,” she says. “That’d be like losing my journals and photo albums, letters from friends, scrapbooks, keepsakes, and things like that to a house fire.” As we build the next era of the web, proponents of decentralized, communally created and owned spaces would be well served to take a page out of the AO3’s book. The people pitching our digital future in themetaversecan feel like they’rebroadcasting a cash grab—and the resolutely noncommercial AO3, where works are written, shared, and passed to Fannish-Next-of Kin wholly for free, might feel like an unlikely comparison. But there are parallels between what AO3 does and the ideas of people like Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin,who proposesusing distributed ledgers not just for financial transactions, but to build webs of trusted connections and experiences to serve as a sort of digital identity. On AO3, small connections like the FNOK are expressions of trust between peers, and they serve to strengthen the whole: a signal that the death of a person you only know online won’t just mean an inactive account, and a promise that the space you are building together will outlast you both. I asked Carpenter, who is in her mid-twenties, if she felt her FNOK arrangement was incongruous with a web generally defined by impermanence. “People have been writing ‘I was here’ graffiti in random places for thousands of years,” she told me. “There is something permanent about designating a FNOK, I agree. But there’s something even more permanent about losing all evidence that you were online at all.” In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-tested gear Abitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Story:An oral history ofWIRED’s original website I madea wholesome OnlyFansto try to make ends meet Event:Join us forWIRED Healthon March 18 in London More From WIRED Reviews and Guides ©2024Condé Nast.

    "news_title": "Martin Shkreli Is Back With a Web3 Drug Discovery Platform | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Martin Shkreli—the notoriousex-pharmaceutical executivefresh from prisonafter his2017 fraud conviction—announced his latest, eyebrow-raising venture this week: the creation of ablockchain-basedWeb3drug discovery platform that traffics in his owncryptocurrency, MSI, akaMartin Shkreli Inu. This story originally appeared onArs Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. The platform, still in the early development phase, is calledDruglike, according toa press releasethat circulated on July 25. Its goals are ostensibly lofty, but the details are extremely sketchy, and Shkreli’s intentions have already drawn skepticism. It’s also unclear whether the enterprise will run Shkreli afoul of hislifetime ban from the pharmaceutical industry, which stemmed from the abrupt and callous 4,000 percent price hike of a life-saving drug that made him infamous. Shkreli, who is named as a cofounder ofDruglike, says the platform aims to make early-stage drug discovery more affordable and accessible. “Druglike will remove barriers to early-stage drug discovery, increase innovation and allow a broader group of contributors to share the rewards,” Shkreli said in the press release. “Underserved and underfunded communities, such as those focused on rare diseases or in developing markets, will also benefit from access to these tools.” Generally, early-stage drug development can sometimes involve virtual screens to identify potential drug candidates. In these cases, pharmaceutical scientists first identify a “target”—a specific compound or protein that plays a critical role in developing a disease or condition. Then researchers look for compounds or small molecules that could interfere with that target, sometimes binding or “docking” directly to the target in a way that keeps it from functioning. This can be done in physical labs using massive libraries of compounds in high-throughput chemical screens. But it can also be done virtually, using specialized software and a lot of computing power, which can be resource-intensive. That’s where Shkreli’s Druglike is imagined to come in. Ina white paperposted onDruglike’s website, Shkreli-associated Jason Sommer lays out some concepts for how the company’s platform would work. Essentially, it would use a decentralized computing network of task providers, solvers, and validators that would run and optimize the virtual screening of drug candidates. The white paper draws similarities toFoldIt, an online puzzle gamethat essentially uses distributed computing and crowdsourcing to fold proteins and predict their structures. But Druglike’s platform is touted as incorporating blockchain concepts and cryptocurrency transactions when users complete tasks, such as docking screens. For instance, the paper describes a “proof-of-optimization” concept as a “novel” blockchain-based verification step for screening work, similar to Bitcoin’s “proof-of-work” method. “We propose a blockchain-based implementation of Proof-of-Optimization, where a distributed ledger stores records of which proof solutions belong to which Solvers. Smart contracts allow secure distribution of rewards to the Solver who owns the verified proof,” Sommer writes in the paper. But, for now, the white paper only loosely describes these concepts, and it’s unclear how the cryptocurrency transactions will generate value. It’s also unclear how the project will be funded, though an online exchange suggested that the company could lookfor venture capital financing. On Twitter, where Shkreli has been banned, he currently has an account asEnrique Hernandez @zkEnrique7. From there,Shkreli announced the company on July 25andhosted a conversation regarding the project. In that conversation, he scoffed at the idea that the platform would breach his lifetime ban from the pharmaceutical industry, saying that the project only involves developing software, not drugs. “Writing some code in Github and pressing ‘go’ does not make you a pharmaceutical company,” he said.

    "news_title": "I Finally Reached Computing Nirvana. What Was It All For? | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Like many nerdsbefore me, I spent a goodly portion of my life searching for the perfectcomputing system. I wanted a single tool that would let me write prose or programs, that could search every email, tweet, or document in a few keystrokes, and that would work across all my devices. I yearned to summit the mythic Mt. Augment, to achieve the enlightenment of a properly orchestrated personal computer. Where thesoftware industryoffered notifications, little clicks and dings, messages jumping up and down on my screen like a dog begging for a treat, I wanted calm textuality. Seeking it, I tweaked. I configured. The purpose of configuration is to make a thing work with some other thing—to make the to-do list work with the email client, say, or the calendar work with the other calendar. It's an interdisciplinary study. Configuration can be as complex as programming or as simple as checking a box. Everyone talks about it, but it's not taken that seriously, because there's not much profit in it. And unfortunately, configuration is indistinguishable from procrastination. A little is fine but too much is embarrassing. I spent almost three decades configuring my text editor, amassing 20 or so dotfiles that would make one acronym or nonsense word concordant with another. (For me: i3wm + emacs + org-mode + notmuch + tmux, bound together with ssh + git + Syncthing + Tailscale.) I'd start down a path, but then there'd be some blocker—some bug I didn't understand, some page of errors I didn't have time to deal with—and I'd give up. A big problem I had was where to put my stuff. I tried different databases, folder structures, private websites, cloud drives, and desktop search tools. The key, finally, was to turn nearly everything in my life into emails. All my calendar entries, essay drafts, tweets—I wrote programs that turned them into gigs and gigs of emails. Emails are horrible, messy, swollen, decrepit forms of data, but they are understood by everything everywhere. You can lard them with attachments. You can tag them. You can add any amount of metadata to them and synchronize them with servers. They suck, but they work. No higher praise. It took years to get all these emails into place, tag them, filter them just so. Little by little I could see more of the shape of my own data. And as I did this, software got better and computers got faster. Not only that, other people started sharingtheirconfig files on GitHub. Then, one cold day—January 31, 2022—something bizarre happened. I was at home, writing a little glue function to make my emails searchable from anywhere inside my text editor. I evaluated that tiny program and ran it. It worked. Somewhere in my brain, I felt a distinctclick. I was done. No longer configuring, but configured. The world had conspired to give me what I wanted. I stood up from the computer, suffused with a sort of European-classical-composer level of emotion, and went for a walk. Was this happiness? Freedom? Or would I find myself back tomorrow, with a whole new set of requirements? The more “professional”a piece of software is intended to be, the more likely it is to be scriptable. CAD tools or 3D programs will provide whole languages just for configuration. But the huge consumer products, the operating systems themselves, are more and more locked down. The reasons are multiple—money, security, simplicity. A lot of our computing is done on someone else's terms. We describe it with carceral words. To assert control over your device, you “jailbreak” out. I wonder if this is one of the reasons people get intocrypto—they dream of a new world that can be customized like software. Programmable money, self-executing contracts, little scripts that rearrange reality. In DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), people use code to make social rules, then buy or do things with their consolidated digital might. A lot of my friends hate all this stuff (perhapsNFTsmore than DAOs) with great passion; they see it as a closing off, a betrayal of the open, trust-driven nature of the early web. Others love it, seeing it as a continuation of the community-building, empowering nature of the early web. What I see is a generation of configurers coming into their own. Older web folks expected to create the new digital economy; these younger ones are trying to create the neweconomyeconomy. Their dream is a more perfect union where humans will, because of computers, stop acting in the ways we've been acting since we came out of the trees. Then again, $200 million in NFTs were stolen the day I drafted this column. When in history have we been able to schedule folly? Sometimes the only way to end the vacation is to drive the RV off a cliff. Perhaps by the time you read this the NFTs will have been returned. That would be a good reconfiguration. But the likely outcome of the boom is that some people will cash out at the right time and become convinced that they hold the keys to the universe and will lecture us for the rest of our lives, and most people (like those who had their NFTs stolen) will be humbled, or at best break even. When in history have we been able to schedule folly? Sometimes the only way to end the vacation is to drive the RV off a cliff. While the youth reconfigure society, I'm done configuring. A month has gone by since theclick, and the urge to tweak is gone. My system looks like something from the '80s (a lot of itisfrom the '80s), but I finally got my room just the way I like it. Here's what I mean. Say I search for the word “database”; 7,222 emails pop up. Most are from marketers and industry mailing lists proclaiming some technological triumph, but nestled among them are messages from me, or to me, about learning to use databases—XML databases, SQL databases, and so forth. When I read these old messages, I am always surprised at how little I've changed, how consistent my obsessions are. There's something valuable to me in justseeingthat, in seeing how the world keeps trumpeting the new while the self stays the same. You'd think there'd be at least five new me's by now, given how often I've vowed to become better. But no. I've been writing about configuring my text editor since 1996. I've been running my mouth about databases at least that long. They say you can't dip your hand in the same river twice, but they rarely mention that it's the same hand doing the dipping. Since the emails are, well, just emails, sometimes I hit Reply (by typing “r”). On a thread that went dormant a decade ago. I don't always offer context. Sometimes I just write, “Curious … how did this turn out?” I used to feel I was intruding, to just drop in like that. But what the hell. It's been a long pandemic. No one has to write back. Out go the emails. Most get no reply; some get a bounce-back. But often enough, people respond at length. Some left the city and came back. Some are up for coffee. A surprising number are now cyborgs (pacemakers, hearing aids). Some are rich, some are broke, some are divorced. One is considering being frozen after death, some are considering getting into crypto, and one has moved to Miami. None of us understand our children. I'm thinking of starting a Sunday morning waffle breakfast forvaccinatedpeople to come stare at each other. It's one thing to email after 10 years, but everyone appreciates an invitation to breakfast. Maybe I'll set up some sort of internet-connected LED scrolly screen, like they put on food carts, so out-of-towners can leave messages. I gotta havesomethingto configure. If you'd asked me, back when I was still configuring, not yet configured, exactly why I was nurturing these dozens of dotfiles, I'd have had a hard time telling you. I would have said: I want a pure and sleek experience. I want the computer working for me, augmenting my dumb brain with its immense arithmetical speed. I want access to my whole digital self. So I am very surprised that the terminal result of my efforts is not some sort of ecstatic communion with the internet, or even with my own computer. The function of my whole big orchestrated, tagged, integrated system was merely to rekindle old ties. What was all that configuration for? It was, in all sincerity, for waffles.

    "news_title": "The Web3 Movement’s Quest to Build a ‘Can’t Be Evil’ Internet | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. It's getting lateon a Saturday afternoon in Denver when I lean back and take in the full weirdness of what I’m doing. I’m seated at a long plastic folding table against the wall in a windowless room, a Discord server open on my laptop. Pizza crusts and empty potato chip bags are piled up around me, evidence of the feverish hours I’ve spent hacking together a project with a trio ofblockchaindevelopers. I’m not a programmer, just a journalist with a law degree. Yet somehow I’ve gotten swept up in creating my own DAO—a decentralized autonomous organization, a favorite concept among the starry-eyed proponents ofWeb3—and it’s supposed to launch tomorrow. No doubt you have questions. So do I. Like: What happened to me? Three days ago I was a crypto skeptic who could barely figure out how to buy ether. Now I’m speaking in complete sentences about multisig treasuries and quadratic voting. The devs have almost integrated our site with non-MetaMask wallets, and I’ve just dropped $85 for a domain on the Ethereum Name Service despite having no clear use for it. And rather than feeling exasperated or baffled, I seem to have caught the same thrill, however fleetingly, as everyone around me. I am among the estimated 10,000 people who arrived in Colorado a few days ago for this year’s ETHDenver conference, the biggest and oldest event in the world ofEthereumand Web3. Most of these folks came here to be among their people. I came to try to understand them. And I think I finally do. The term Web3,as you may or may not have noticed, emerged from obscurity last year, buoyed by rising cryptocurrency prices and some canny marketing by venture capitalists. Its meaning is hard to pin down. In the media and on Twitter, Web3 has become a catchall for anything having to do with blockchains and cryptocurrency: People paying tens of thousands of dollars for digital collectibles known as non-fungible tokens, orNFTs, with neither practical nor aesthetic value, then flipping them for even ungodlier sums.“Play-to-earn” video gamesthat lure gamers into flimsy virtual worlds with the promise of riches. Celebrities shilling crypto exchanges during the Super Bowl. A ceaseless parade ofscams,hacks, andfrauds. But to a core of true believers, Web3 stands apart from the garish excesses and brazen misbehavior of the flashing-neon crypto casino. If cryptocurrency was originally about decentralizing money, Web3 is about decentralizing … everything. Its mission is almost achingly idealistic: to free humanity not only from Big Tech domination but also from exploitative capitalism itself—and to do it purely through code. Bitcoin, the original blockchain-based cryptocurrency, created a way to send and receive digital money without needing a bank to approve those transactions. Instead of regulators and cops, a set of carefully designed incentives would, in theory, keep everyone acting in the best interests of all Bitcoin users. Web3 aims to apply these two concepts—decentralization and game theory—to all of digital life. The main vehicle for this is Ethereum, a blockchain that borrowed Bitcoin’s key features and added a major innovation: It was designed with its own programming language so developers could build apps, and eventually a whole new decentralized digital infrastructure, to run on it. If Bitcoin attracts anarcho-capitalists who want to dethrone the central bankers, the culture around Ethereum and Web3 has a more progressive bent. After I walked into the Denver Sports Castle, a massive former sporting goods store turned events space that served as ETHDenver’s main venue, the first panel I caught was about using blockchains to build “public goods.” Another was titled “Navigating the Web3 Workforce as a BIPOC, Queer, Marginalized Individual.” (The overall crowd skewed heavily white and male.) Aesthetically, ETHDenver embraced a spirit of collaborative, LARPish make-believe; there was quite a bit of talk about the Bufficorn, the cartoon buffalo-unicorn hybrid that was the event’s NFT mascot. (It fuses the magic of the unicorn with the strength of the buffalo.) People communicated with all manner of cheerful memes:gm, for “good morning,” was the universal greeting, regardless of the time of day;wagmimeant “we’re all gonna make it.” The Bufficorn, ETHDenver's mascot, and Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum. During the opening ceremony, the conference organizers emphasized Web3’s idealism. “It’s not about money,” said John Paller, founder of ETHDenver. “We don’t care about that.” The theme of the conference, he explained, was “BUIDLing.” The term, which everyone pronounced “biddling,” is a riff on the crypto meme “HODLing”—holding one’s assets no matter how grim the market looks, as an expression of faith in its long-term value. (In crypto, as in all internet culture, typos are a rich source of memes.) “BUIDL is the rally cry of the Bufficorn,” Paller said. What exactly were they BUIDLing? It’s easy to find brilliant, idealistic, experienced technology experts who think Web3 is pure nonsense. But it’s almost as easy to find ones who think it’s the real deal—humanity’s best chance of redeeming the entire promise of the internet. On day two, the toilets broke; the venue’s plumbing wasn’t ready for so many people. Ethereum has a similar problem. One way tothink about Web3 is right there in the name: It’s the successor to Web 2.0, the era that was supposed to democratize the internet but instead became dominated by a handful of huge platforms, like Google and Facebook. Web3 is aboutre-decentralizing the web. From its Darpa-funded infancy, the internet was designed to be decentralized. This had a very practical Cold War–era purpose: A network of computers spread around the country couldn’t be wiped out in a single nuclear blast. Early enthusiasts also saw in this distributed structure an inherently liberating tendency, a spirit captured in John Gilmore’s famous 1993 dictum, “The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.” As the 1990s wore on, however, the dream of decentralization frayed. During what would later be dubbed the Web 1.0 era, the typical internet user, though theoretically empowered to create web pages, was in practice doing little more than viewing those made by others. And as a mature economy developed around the internet, powerful companies began to centralize on top of its open protocols—like Microsoft using its operating system monopoly to take over the browser market with Internet Explorer. Then came the dotcom crash, which called into question whether the internet would ever fulfill its potential. Hope reemerged in the mid-2000s, when new platforms and technologies allowed ordinary users to create and upload content that could reach thousands or even millions of people. If Web 1.0 saw the masses passively consuming media created by publishers, in Web 2.0, the masses would be the creators: Wikipedia entries, Amazon product reviews, blog posts, YouTube videos, crowdfunding campaigns.Timecaptured the spirit of the moment with its 2006 Person of the Year selection: “You.” But something very different was happening beneath the surface. User-­generated content was free labor, and the platforms were the bosses. The big winners slurped up user data and used it, along with old-­fashioned mergers and acquisitions, to build competitive moats around their businesses. Today, one company, Meta, owns three of the four largest social apps in the world, in terms of users. The fourth, YouTube, is owned by ­Google, which also accounts for around 90 percent of all internet searches. As these companies conquered more and more of the web, it became clear that the user was less a creative partner than a source of raw material to be perpetually harvested. Escape is difficult. Meta controls access to your Facebook and Instagram photos, plus your friend lists. Want to ditch Twitter or find a streaming alternative to YouTube? You can’t take your followers with you. And if a platform chooses to suspend or cancel your account, you have little recourse. In hindsight, there’s no shortage of explanations for why Web 2.0 failed to deliver on its early promise. Network effects. The unforeseen power of big data. Corporate greed. None of these have gone away. So why should we expect anything new from Web3? For believers, the answer is simple: Blockchain is different. Gavin Wood, an English computer scientist who helped program Ethereum, coined the term Web3 in 2014, the year Ethereum launched. (He first called it Web 3.0, but the decimal thing has since become passé.) In his view, Web 2.0’s fatal flaw wastrust. Everyone had to trust the biggest platforms not to abuse their power as they grew. Few seemed to notice that Google’s famous early motto, “Don’t be evil,” implied that being evil was an option. To Wood, Web3 is about building systems that don’t rely on trusting people, corporations, or governments to make moral choices, but that instead render evil choices impossible. Blockchain is the crucial technology for making that happen. Brewster Kahle, the creator of the Internet Archive and the Wayback Machine, has described this goal as “locking the web open.” Or, as Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto fund and a leading Web3 booster, puts it, “Can’t be evil > don’t be evil.” A blockchain is a database that lives across a network of computers rather than on one server. No single person or organization owns it. Every computer, or node, stores a complete record of every transaction, so no one can control or destroy the network without first taking over a majority of the nodes. This makes it impossible for anyone to manipulate the database, say by giving themselves more tokens. Every change and transaction is logged on the chain, for all the world to see. There’s no central authority that must be trusted to enforce the rules.  So how exactly are blockchains supposed to lock the web open? Right now, platforms like Instagram and TikTok own the data that you generate while using them, store it on their servers, and make extracting it hard or impossible. In a Web3 world, the theory goes, your data would live on a blockchain, not a central server. Instead of platforms owning it,youwould, controlling access to it via a private cryptographic key that only you possess. If you got tired of one service, you could take your data to another. And a platform couldn’t change the rules of the game by erecting walls around its data, because it would never have owned the data in the first place. Innumerable Web3 startups are trying to apply this theory by creating blockchain-based alternatives to just about any platform you can name: Spotify, Twitter, Instagram, Google Docs. The liberal billionaire Frank McCourt has pledged $25 million toward developing a protocol for putting your social graph—the interlocking map of relationships that you’ve built up over the years but that is probably owned by Facebook—on the blockchain. A company called Sapien purports to be building an entire Web3 metaverse. Faith in blockchain infrastructure as a forcing mechanism for decentralization is Web3’s first tenet. There are other tenets—but we’ll get to those later. Because the infrastructure is making some ominous creaking noises already. On day twoof ETHDenver, the toilets broke. The plumbing at the Sports Castle wasn’t ready for so many people. Ethereum has a similar problem. Like the Sports Castle, it can’t handle the load of transactions going through its pipes. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, operates on a system known as “proof of work.” Computers in the network “mine” new tokens by being the first to solve complex math problems and get paid a fluctuating “gas fee” for verifying transactions on the blockchain. The more demand on the network, the higher the gas fee. Ethereum has grown so popular that gas fees are often prohibitively high. During its wild surge late last year, they topped $55 per transaction. The math problems also requirea ton of electricity. By one estimate, if the world’s countries were ranked by energy consumption, the combined nation of Bitcoin and Ethereum would slot in between Italy and the United Kingdom. While many Bitcoiners shrug at this, Web3 proponents are torn up at the thought of contributing to the climate crisis. It seemed like every third person at ETHDenver was working on some kind of fix for these issues. Ethereum’s core developers have long been trying to execute a shift to “proof of stake,” a more eco-friendly (but possibly less secure) alternative to proof of work, that after years of delay is supposed to launch this year. There are also competing blockchains that don’t use proof of work and thus don’t incur the environmental costs or gas fees of Ethereum. Then there are “Layer 2” blockchains that do most of the work on their own network before logging the results on Ethereum in big batches to lower the cost per transaction. Beyond the bandwidth problems, there was broad agreement among the ETHDenver crowd that the technology is far too difficult to use. Doing anything in Web3 is unbelievably confusing. I needed help just to redeem my crypto lunch tokens when I checked in at the hotel. If you want to get anything done and aren’t a programmer, you end up just clicking “OK” on a bunch of prompts that you don’t understand. This is a great way to get ripped off. During the conference, word got around that a phishing attack was hittingOpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace. In the end, almost $2 million worth of NFTs would be stolen. So common are these episodes that the news hardly raised eyebrows. Crypto’s user-unfriendliness puts tremendous pressure on the whole ecosystem to do the one thing it was designed not to do: centralize. In January, Moxie Marlinspike, a cryptographer and creator of the open source encrypted messaging app Signal, wrotean incisive takedownof Web3’s under­lying premises on his personal blog. In it, Marlinspike argues that because most people crave convenience, centralized services always end up imposing themselves on top of decentralized technologies. In the early days of Web 1.0, some people thought “we’d all have our own web server with our own website, our own mail server for our own email,” he writes. “However—and I don’t think this can be emphasized enough—that is not what people want. People do not want to run their own servers.” This pattern, Marlinspike points out, is already repeating itself in Web3. It’s quite cumbersome, if not impossible, for an app on your phone to interact directly with a blockchain. So almost all Web3 apps rely on one of two companies, Infura and Alchemy, to do that. Likewise the digital wallets that most people use to store their crypto assets. In other words, nearly every Web3 product relies on a middleman to say what’s happening on the blockchain. That’s a whole lot of trust for a system designed to make trust obsolete. The situation is even more centralized than Marlinspike lets on, because one company, ConsenSys, owns both Infura and the most popular wallet, MetaMask. Yes, your data lives indelibly somewhere on the blockchain, but in practice, any Web3 app you might use probably relies on these centralized services to access it. As an illustration, Marlinspike writes that when a satirical NFT he created got pulled from OpenSea, it also stopped appearing in his MetaMask wallet, even though it still existed on the blockchain. Marlinspike notes that Web3 defenders tend to reply to critiques by insisting, “It’s early days still.” It took exactly one day for Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, to prove his point. In a response to Marlinspike that he posted on Reddit, Buterin wrote that many of Marlinspike’s points “strike me as having a correct criticism of thecurrent stateof the ecosystem, but they are missing where the blockchain ecosystem is going.” A small faction within the Web3 fold argues that blockchain is getting more attention than it deserves—a medium that has come to stand in the way of the true message, which is decentralization. “I would very strongly say, Web3 is not synonymous with blockchains,” says Jeromy Johnson, an engineer at Protocol Labs, a Web3 R&D organization. Johnson works on blockchain projects, but he also helped code the Inter­Planetary File System, a peer-to-peer alternative to the hypertext transfer protocol (that “http://” bit at the front of every web address). Using IPFS prevents content from disappearing from the web just because a certain URL expires or changes. It’s a leading example of decentralized tech that isn’t blockchain. “There’s a lot of things that people try to use blockchain for that you don’t actually need a blockchain for,” Johnson says. “People try to build social networks on blockchains, and they put every tweet, or whatever they call it, and every ‘like’ on the blockchain, and it’s like, What are you doing? That’s so dumb!” Johnson worries that blockchain has become a fetish. But I came to Denver wondering whether the same could be said of decentralization itself, as Web3 people understood it. Because the biggest barriers to decentralizing power may not be technological at all. Crypto’s user-unfriendliness keeps pushing the system to do the one thing it was designed not to do: centralize. Centralization is avague term. One of cryptocurrency’s original aims was to remove intermediaries—banks—from financial transactions. (Hence its appeal among a certain set of libertarians, criminals, and lately Russian oligarchs.) That’s one way to think about centralization: A bank sits at the center of a transaction between two or more entities. But centralization and decentralization can also be framed as a matter of choice: How many options do you have? Is there just one player in the market, or can you shop around? By that standard, the banking industry is pretty decentralized. There are thousands of banks operating in the US alone. A decentralized technology does not guarantee a decentralized market. Take email. Email is a decentralized protocol. Anybody can, in theory, set up their own email server, but very few people do, as Marlinspike pointed out. Instead, people use email clients, and the market has centralized heavily around a handful of providers, especially Gmail. Even if you personally opt out of Gmail, the person on the other end of every second email you send probably uses it, meaning a copy of your email lives on Google’s servers whether you want it to or not. Centralizationis one word for this;consolidationis a better one. Consolidation is a feature not of technology but of markets. There is a much older protocol for dealing with consolidated markets than Web3. It’s called antitrust law. But government policy does not really figure into the Web3 blueprint. On the morning the toilets broke, I moderated a panel titled “Why Decentralization Matters.” At one point, one of the panelists, Nick Dodson, an engineer at Fuel Labs, observed that “traditional fintech”—personal finance apps that don’t use blockchains or crypto—is arguably more decentralized than Web3 “because, to be honest, there’s more companies doing things.” Did you know, I asked, that the fintech sector owes much of its existence to a piece of federal legislation? The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis, has a section requiring US banks to let customers access their account data in a format that can be read by computer applications. You can thank that provision for the ability to sync up your data with personal finance apps like Betterment and Mint. On the back of this observation, I turned to one of the other panelists, Frankie Pangilinan, an accomplished blockchain programmer. Given the daunting technical challenges facing Web3, I asked, wouldn’t a simpler path to decentralization be for Congress to pass laws mandating data portability and interoperability? Wouldn’t that be easier than trying to iron out the kinks in all this complicated, unwieldy tech? “Oh my God, what—could you just re-ask that question? I’m so sorry,” Pangilinan said, with the half-smile of someone unsure whether their leg is being pulled. I repeated myself. Wouldn’t a data portability law be easier than the whole Web3 thing? “Government moveswayslower than software does,” she said, with an incredulous laugh. “They’re an archaic system that we’re replacing, essentially.” Pangilinan was channeling the dominant view within the Web3 movement. Her skepticism is understandable. The internet economy arose during a period of deregulation and historically lax antitrust enforcement. The US government, in particular, has yet to prove itself capable of passing a significant law regulating Silicon Valley or winning a major lawsuit against a platform giant. Congress is, objectively speaking, an archaic system. And yet law, with all its faults, is still pretty much the most effective technology ever devised for preventing people and corporations from abusing their power—and forcing them to share it. Even within the tech sector, there’s a robust history of government intervention spurring innovation and user choice. Sometimes this comes through dramatic legal confrontations. In the 1950s, antitrust pressure from the federal government forced AT&T and its Bell Labs subsidiary to license out thousands of patents, including one for a little thing called the transistor. Other times, the role of government in decentralizing markets is practically invisible. It’s thanks to a little-known Federal Communications Commission regulation, for example, that Americans get to keep their cell phone numbers when they switch carriers. But even members of the progressive Web3 community have essentially zero interest in directing their formidable resources toward influencing public policy. They tend to think, instead, as Pangilinan put it, that government is the problem being designed around: just another institution, like Google or Facebook, that demands our trust without earning it. Later on, I chatted backstage with the third panelist, a former Ethereum core developer named Lane Rettig. He was frank about the shortcomings of crypto and Web3. But he strongly agreed with Pangilinan about the futility of government regulation. Rettig is working on a blockchain called Spacemesh. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which require tremendous computing power to mine, anyone can mine Spacemesh tokens using spare processing power on their laptop or smartphone, just by downloading an ordinary-looking app—meaning the network could be distributed among millions of participants, rather than the tens of thousands of people who run Bitcoin or Ethereum nodes. That sounded interesting, so I pulled out my iPhone. Could I download it right then? No, Rettig said; unfortunately, Space­mesh wasn’t available on phones yet. The mobile app hadn’t been built, but even if it had, Apple blocks most crypto-related apps from its App Store. In a call-back to my “regulation is good” routine, I joked that the Open App Markets Act—a bill that has bipartisan momentum in Congress and would force Apple to permit downloading apps not offered in its App Store—would help with that. Rettig’s eyes lit up. “That’s a bill?” he said excitedly. “That’s huge. I can see that having big implications.” It’s not quiteright to say that crypto people are wholly uninterested in regulation. According to a recent report, the amount spent on crypto lobbying has quadrupled since 2018. But this effort isn’t aimed at using regulation to achieve the goals of decentralized markets or data portability. It’s mostly aboutblockingnew regulations that might stop the gravy train, making sure the state stays out of crypto’s way. That gravy train has a name: DeFi. Short for “decentralized finance,” DeFi is essentially a crypto betting market, with financial products that allow investors to gamble on cryptocurrencies via options, derivatives, and other avenues. A common one is “yield farming,” which in essence means lending out your crypto in exchange for interest payments. DeFi is big business. The ETHDenver conference may have been a pageant of high-minded ideals, but it was overwhelmingly underwritten by DeFi companies. At any given moment, almost all the most popular Ethereum apps are some form of DeFi platform or exchange. Unlike in traditional finance, these are largely unregulated. If someone steals your money, the bank doesn’t have to pay you back—because there is no bank. This is far from an idle concern. One analysis found that more than $10 billion was stolen from DeFi platforms in 2021 alone. On my first night in Denver, I headed to a happy hour sponsored by Uma, which bills itself as “a fast, flexible, and secure way to create decentralized financial products.” The event was crawling with DeFi people, each of whom assured me that their product promised super-high yields with minimal risk. Arisa Toyosaki, a former investment banker, told me about the startup she was launching, called Cega. With Cega, she explained, crypto holders will be able to invest in exotic crypto derivatives and generate healthy returns. And, she assured me, it will be nearly impossible to lose money unless the market drops more than 50 percent. How is this possible? “I used to do this at investment banks,” Toyosaki said. The DeFi derivative market, she said, “exploded in the back half of 2021.” For the first time, there are enough crypto products to slice and dice into derivatives. To do that well, Toyosaki explained, you need a team of quants who can build advanced statistical models of markets. This was evidently meant to be reassuring. Just in case the parallels to the eve of the 2008 financial crisis were too subtle, my next stop was a performance by the Dutch DJ Tiësto that was hosted by Bacon Coin, a startup that offersmortgage-backed crypto tokens. Even as DeFi dominated the sponsorships and party calendar, many of the Web3 true believers viewed it with disdain. The rows of tables where crypto companies pitched their wares was labeled the “Shill Zone” on the official conference map. As I was leaving a coffee shop one day, I overheard two guys sitting at a table outside. “I’m not into DeFi,” one said. “Oh,” said the other, “you’re not a Ponzinomics person?” Vitalik Buterin was at the next table, by the looks of it gamely letting someone shill their business to him. Even Buterin publicly worries about the cash grab taking place in the Ethereum universe he created. “If we don’t exercise our voice, the only things that get built are the things that are immediately profitable,” he recently toldTime. “And those are often far from what’s actually the best for the world.” But there’s a paradox. As much as Web3’s dreamers might shun the crypto casino, the fact remains that cryptocurrency—money—is the driving force of what they’re trying to build. This is where all the game theory comes in, along with the other, higher tenets of Web3. It’s also where the Web3 movement breaks with the economic innocence of past waves of internet utopianism. In case the parallels to the eve of the 2008 financial crisis were too subtle, my next stop was a startup that offers mortgage-backed crypto tokens. Back in theearly days of Web 2.0, the open source movement—that era’s generation of idealists—was guided by a perhaps naive belief in the willingness of people to volunteer their energies and talents for the greater good. Linux die-hards believed software should be free, recoiling at the profit motive. The platforms born in this era played to that spirit, deploying lofty rhetoric about making the world a better, more open, more connected place—while, in the background, quietly setting up global surveillance operations to spy on their users for the benefit of advertisers. “A lot of open-web, open source people always thought that money was dirty,” says Julien Genestoux, a veteran of the open source movement who created Unlock Protocol, which seeks to put memberships and subscriptions on the blockchain. “One of the things crypto has been doing is putting money front and center,” he says. “By doing this, it removes the ability of corporate actors to capture the value from everybody else without us knowing. By making it explicit, a thing we’re all staring at, we’re making it harder for the people who want to take it from everybody else.” At the most basic level, Web3’s approach to financial incentives is an ingenious way of solving new technology’s adoption problem. Let’s say you make a new decentralized platform built on the blockchain, one that works so smoothly that people can use it without getting a PhD in cryptography. Users control their own data and everything is open source. The thing is, those ordinary users probably don’t care much about data ownership or immutable public ledgers. They care about convenience and fun and being where their friends are. So how do you get anyone to use your new Web3 app? The answer is tokenomics. The business model of nearly every proposed Web3 platform entails distributing tokens to everyone involved, thus incentivizing them to use and improve the platform to make the value of those tokens go up. In Web3-speak, this is called “aligning the incentives.” The concept has its roots in Bitcoin, whose pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, devised a set of rules to prevent conflict between an individual’s self-interest and the interests of Bitcoin. Using game theory principles, Bitcoin could incentivize everyone to act for the collective good. Even if someone took control of enough of the network to be able to rewrite its history and inflate their account, they would have a powerful reason not to: Such treachery would kill confidence in Bitcoin and thus crater the value of their own holdings. Many people see Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as pyramid schemes, since their value is a pure function of there being someone else who wants to buy in. But tokenomics can, at least theoretically, serve a useful purpose out in the real world. Take Presearch, a Web3 search engine. Presearch is distributed across a network of nodes that anyone can set up on their computer or a virtual private server. Your search term gets passed to one of the nodes, which queries a range of sources before returning a response. People who run nodes are rewarded in the form of PRE tokens, Presearch’s custom crypto coin. Users can also be rewarded with tiny micropayments of the token for performing searches. As the platform gets more popular, the tokens should become more valuable. That value has a real-world reference point: Advertisers have to buy tokens in order to appear above search results. Will this work? Perhaps not. But it’s not a Ponzi scheme. Web3 apps promise not just to pay users but to give them a say in how the platforms are run. In the case of Presearch, for example, the PRE token will confer ownership and some kind of governance power over the platform. In theory, that distributed structure should prevent anyone from pushing Presearch in any shady or exploitative directions. “Why are we not going to end up like Google?” says Presearch’s founder, Colin Pape, referring to the search giant’s well documented privacy issues. “Because we have everyone aligned around this one value unit, and if we try to extract too much value from users, and they get pissed off, the value of the token goes down.” That sounds plausible in the abstract, but it raises all sorts of practical questions. How do you keep someone from buying enough tokens to exert unilateral control? How do you know the crypto accounts holding tokens belong to separate human beings? If you do manage to keep things decentralized, how will you act quickly enough to compete with traditional businesses that don’t have to put every single decision to a vote? The answers are all speculative, because none of that governance stuff actually exists yet. Pape admits that decentralized control remains an aspiration for Presearch. The reality is that the company, meaning Pape, controls the search engine, just like Alphabet controls Google. This is something of a theme in the Web3 world. Everyone has a white paper spelling out how their new platform will be governed by “the community” … eventually, ultimately, at some future point yet to be determined, once a whole bunch of other issues are sorted out and the platform gets big enough to remove the training wheels.Oh Lord, give me decentralized control, but not yet. If the vision of collectively run mega-platforms sounds implausibly far out, the highest tenets of Web3 are somehow even more ambitious. Using blockchain technology and tokenomics to get people to buy into a set of decentralized apps? That’s just the beginning. For some Web3 luminaries, the real goal is to use cryptocurrencies to lock human beings into a more cooperative, less self-destructive society. I didn’t fully understand this until I met Kevin Owocki. Few people aretrying harder to turn the idealism of Web3 into reality than Owocki. A resident of Boulder County, near Denver, Owocki is the founder of GitCoin, a platform for funding open source Web3 projects that has raised and distributed roughly $60 million so far. He was one of the most Colorado of the many Colorado guys on hand at ETHDenver, with long hair past his shoulders, a trim beard, and an athletic build. At one point, when I said I was thirsty, he pulled a can of kombucha out of his back pocket and handed it to me. Owocki was something of a rock star at the conference. He is credited with coining the term BUIDL in 2017. Admirers approached him nonstop to talk, express their support, or ask for a copy of his book,GreenPilled: How Crypto Can Regenerate the World, which was the talk of the conference and quickly sold out of the 400 copies he had ordered. Owocki is about as far from a casino person as you’ll find in the crypto world. In one of several presentations he gave, Owocki told the crowd that since research shows money stops increasing happiness after about $100,000 in annual income, Web3 founders should maximize their happiness by giving their excess money to public goods that everyone gets to enjoy. “There’s cypherpunk, which is all about privacy, decentralization: hardcore libertarian shit,” he told me. “I’m more of a leftist. I’m more solarpunk, which is, how do we solve our contemporary problems around sustainability and equitable economic systems? It’s a different set of values.” The internet, he explained, made it possible to move information between computers. This revolutionized communication. Blockchains have made it possible to move units of value between computers. Owocki believes this can be harnessed to revolutionize how human beings interact through something he calls “regenerative cryptoeconomics.” Crypto­economics, he writes inGreenPilled, “is the use of blockchain-based incentives to design new kinds of systems, applications, or networks.”Regenerativecryptoeconomics means doing this in a way that makes the world a better place for everyone. The goal is to break free from the zero-sum, rich-get-richer patterns of capitalism. Owocki believes that the right cryptoeconomic structure can help solve collective action problems like climate change, misinformation, and an underfunded digital infrastructure. The key tool for achieving this is adecentralized autonomous organization. In theory, a DAO (yes, pronounced the same as the ancient Chinese word for the way of the universe) uses crypto­currency to boost collective action. Typically, members join by buying some amount of a custom token issued by the DAO. That entitles them to an ownership stake in the DAO itself. Member-owners vote on what the DAO does—which is mostly to say, what it spends money on, since a blockchain-based entity can do little besides move funds from one address to another. The young concept already has a checkered history. The first DAO, named simply “The DAO,” collapsed in 2016 after someone exploited a loophole in its code to siphon off what was then worth some $50 million in Ethereum currency. Similarly colorful failures have followed. DAOs were nonetheless all the rage at ETHDenver, where attendees waxed on about their world-changing potential. Kimbal Musk, Elon’s photogenic brother, spoke about his Big Green DAO, a food-related charity. Giving away money via a DAO, he insisted, got rid of all the painful bureaucracy of philanthropic nonprofits. “It’s way better,” he said, though he also granted that “there are many ways to fail, and this one could fail spectacularly.” What is it about a DAO that—unlike, say, a Kickstarter page—frees humanity from the collective action problems that threaten to doom the species? According to Owocki, it’s the ability to write code in ways that tinker with incentive structures. (In this sense, the first DAO was arguably Bitcoin itself.) “Our weapon of choice is novel mechanism designs, based upon sound game theory, deployed to decentralized blockchain networks as transparent open source code,” he writes inGreenPilled.Indeed, the book has very little to say about technology, per se, and much more to say about various game theory concepts. These range from the sort of thing you’d learn in an undergrad econ class—“public goods are non-­excludable and non-rivalrous”—to things that wouldn’t be out of place in a sci-fi novel: “community inclusion currencies,” “fractal DAO protocols,” “retroactive public goods funding.” It’s hard enough for me to grasp how a DAO works. So while I’m in Denver, I create one. One of the most powerful incentive design techniques, according to Owocki, is something called quadratic voting. Standing near the edge of the Shill Zone, Owocki turned around to show me the back of his purple baseball jacket, which said “Quadratic Lands.” The Quadratic Lands, Owocki explained, are a mythical place where the laws of economics have been redesigned to produce public goods. “It’s just a meme,” he said. “I don’t want to tell you it already exists.” (Everyone at ETHDenver was concerned, rightly, about my ability to separate metaphorical claims from literal ones.) In a quadratic voting system, you get a budget to allocate among various options. Let’s say it’s dollars, though it could be any unit. The more dollars you allocate to a particular choice, the more your vote for it counts. But there’s an important caveat: Each marginal dollar you pledge to the same choice is worth less than the previous one. (Technically, the “cost” of your vote rises quadratically, rather than linearly.) This makes it harder for the richest people in a group to dominate the vote. GitCoin uses an adaptation, quadratic funding, to award money to Web3 projects. The number of people who contribute to a given project counts more than the amount they contribute. This rewards ideas supported by the most people rather than the wealthiest: regenerative cryptonomics in action. Glen Weyl, the polymathic Microsoft researcher who came up with quadratic voting, is far more cautious than Owocki about its applicability to blockchain. In a foreword to Owocki’s book, he writes, “I am deeply ambivalent about Web3.” He has positioned himself as a sort of insider critic of the movement, one who supports its broad goals of decentralization and digital public goods but questions its faith in the potential of blockchains and cryptocurrencies in their current state. Weyl walked me through the weaknesses of using quadratic voting in a DAO. A major problem is Sybil attacks, in which one person creates a thousand “sock puppet” accounts and uses them to take over the voting. Even if you come up with a solution to the proof-of-­identity problem so that it’s hard to make duplicate accounts, someone could just get people in the analog world to create accounts on their behalf. Imagine, Weyl said, if the Chinese government wanted to take over a DAO. All it would have to do is instruct its citizens to join and hand over control of their wallets. Owocki believes he and his co-revolutionaries can sort out these problems. He asked if I’d heard of the Matthew Effect, which, he explained, is how economists refer to the fact that the rich tend to get richer. “It’s a fundamental law of economics,” he said, but that doesn’t mean it’s unbeatable. Conquering laws of nature is what technology is for. “An airplane upends gravity; what if you can build an economic system that upends the Matthew Effect? Dude, quadratic voting is it.” All of thisis getting a little heady for me. Never mind the furthest reaches of Owocki’s theory; it’s hard enough for me to grasp how a DAO is supposed to work. So while I’m in Denver, I decide tocreate one. My friend Jacksón Smith works for a nonprofit called Learning Economy Foundation that researches the use of blockchain in education. He’s at the conference and agrees to help me create the DAO. We settle on an admittedly low-stakes idea: Our DAO will try to winThe New Yorkermagazine’s weekly cartoon caption contest, in which readers compete to supply the wittiest punch line to a captionless cartoon. Each week, the DAO members will vote on each other’s submissions and submit the internal winner to the actual contest. We call it lmaoDAO. I put in serious hours on the DAO over the weekend, but not as many as Jacksón and a couple of his coworkers, who actually know how to program and generously volunteer time to build it, and whom I half-jokingly start referring to as “my core devs.” I should say, to BUIDL it. We’re BUIDLers, officially hacking together a Web3 application in the spirit of ETHDenver. I am somewhat surprised to find that, when I explain what I’m doing, people at the conference are unfailingly supportive. I thought they might take exception to a journalist creating a DAO as a stunt, an act of mild trolling, but the general sense is that we’ve come up with a clever idea. Web3 is a realm where coders can feel good again about working in tech. Two things becomevery clear as we create the DAO. First, a DAO is nothing more than a group whose membership requires owning a crypto token—in our case, a custom LMAO coin that we mint out of thin air. Like most DAOs, ours is organized on Discord, a Web 2.0 application. Our DAO isn’t really decentralized; we control the Discord, Jacksón controls the voting website, and I manually submit the captions to NewYorker.com. We've committed in principle to building out decentralized governance, but who knows when that will happen. In the meantime, everyone else has to trust that we’re doing what we say we are. The second thing that becomes clear is that BUIDLing is really fun. Setting up a DAO is a bit like designing a video game. You have to create incentives and rules that will keep people playing and can’t be easily exploited. In fact, it feels like a game within a game, because Web3 itself is not unlike an immersive RPG—an alternate reality with its own rules, customs, and language. Play for long enough and you stop having to check the instructions. All kinds of esoteric jargon starts making sense.Switch your wallet from the Ethereum mainnet to the Gnosis chain to claim your LMAO tokens. Sync your tokens with the ­collab.land Discord bot to prove you’re a member and get access to the locked Discord channels. The real fun of BUIDLing lies in the problem-solving. How will we get people to join, for example? Nathan, one of my devs, comes up with an idea: He can scrape every crypto wallet that holds either a Bufficorn NFT or ETHDenver meal tokens, and use that as a proxy for people who attended the conference. Then we can “airdrop” our custom token to everyone on that list. Most intoxicatingly, this all takes place in a relatively closed system. Very few of these decisions require us to think much about the messy world outside the confines of our DAO. It all helps me understand the draw of Web3. The sense of moral valor that once accompanied working in Web 2.0 is harder to find these days. Whatever else Web3 is, it’s a realm where coders and technologists can reconnect with the joy of hacking, where they can feel good again about working in tech. Jacksón, who in fact builds elaborate board games as a hobby, tells me that escapism is part of Web3’s appeal. The question is whether the escape hatch leads to a real place or a fantasyland. As those pizza crusts and empty snack bags pile up, I realize that it’s Saturday evening, and dinnertime is approaching. There’s a rumor that Snoop Dogg, who recently announced his intention to turn Death Row Records into an NFT music label, is throwing a party somewhere. But I have plans to meet up with my childhood friend Dave, who lives in Denver. As Dave and I catch up over tacos and margaritas, I feel slightly crazed, struggling to explain what I’ve been up to: Web3, cryptoeconomics, BUIDLing a DAO. I’m a bit like Dorothy returned from Oz. Gradually, talk drifts to normal stuff: his family, my job, a trip we’ve been planning. That night, I sleep in Dave’s basement, and on Sunday morning I’m woken early by the patter of his 2-year-old daughter’s feet. The guys at the conference seem to really believe they’re building a better world for her, but in the morning light it’s hard to take seriously the idea that her future depends on precisely calibrating a bunch of incentives in a blockchain membership organization. It all feels like a game that I’ve unplugged from. Then my phone buzzes. My services are needed before the DAO can officially launch. Without thinking much of it, I plug myself back in.

Given what we know about the divisiveness, violence, and misinformation that social media promotes—and now Dorsey's remorse—is there anything left to redeem it?” —Following @Jack Dear Following, It's never a good sign when the creator of a technology disowns his own creation, though it happens with surprising frequency. Einstein regretted his work on nuclear chain reactions, which led to the creation of the atomic bomb. Toward the end of his life, Mikhail Kalashnikov, the Russian military engineer who designed the AK-47, realized with a pang of guilt that his invention had been responsible for more deaths than any other assault rifle. One might wish these men had displayed a greater dose of foresight, but how much can we expect of humans when God himself failed to anticipate the destructive potential of his own creation? In the book of Genesis, God looks down on the evil taking place on earth and sees he has made a grave error: “The Lord regretted making human beings on the earth, and his heart was grieved.” His unsuccessful effort to wipe humans from the planet with a flood and embark on a new, more virtuous start proves the ultimate uselessness of such regret. It is an unfortunate but reliable truth that creators tend to recognize their oversights only after it's too late to undo them. Their tears of remorse may flood the earth, but they cannot wash away the damage.

Given the pervasiveness of ancient myths that imagine an Edenic world descending into chaos, you would think we'd be more wary of the promises of virtual utopias. Throughout the mid-1990s, techno-idealists (many of them writing in the pages of this magazine) argued that “the Net” would level social hierarchies, enable new forms of political organization, and put an end to corporate power. With the arrival of Web 2.0, these hopes coalesced markedly around Twitter, whose role in organizing protests during theArab Springsuggested that the site could unite the masses against unjust powers.Dorsey himselfemerged like a prophet from the wilderness, a young man who spoke in aphorisms and was often described as “ascetic,” thanks to his fasts, his Shaker furniture, and his simple, yet pricey, Filson bags. Profiles routinely rehearsed his childhood fascination with cities and systems and described him looming over the panorama of San Francisco from the heights of the Square (now Block) headquarters. Here was a “visionary” in the word's most literal sense, a godlike figure who could anticipate the complex functions of the world that so few of us could glimpse from the ground. “At the core of his being, he really wants to make the world a better place,” said a mentor of his in 2011. Today, 57 percent of internet traffic is controlled by six behemoths—Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix. Although Twitter is not among them, it has become yet another seedbed for the problems that have sprouted from these centralized powers: misinformation, ideological polarization, data mining, mass surveillance, and algorithms that amplify the most extreme and sensationalist voices. The empyrean heights from which we have fallen are evident in Twitter's most popular endearment, “this hellsite,” a phrase parroted by those who hate the world they cannot bring themselves to leave. The fact that you have to ask whether these platforms have any redeeming values, Following, suggests that you too have come to detest your existence there. I'm not sure I can convince you otherwise. If there remains anything constructive about social media, it's perhaps what it can teach us about human nature and the ways in which horrible effects can stem from good intentions. In theology, this problem is called “theodicy,” the question of how evil can emerge in a world created by a being who is both entirely powerful and entirely good. Norbert Wiener, the father of cybernetics, once argued that theodicy might offer a useful way to think about our own role as technological creators. In his 1964 bookGod & Golem, Inc., he noted that many religious narratives, including “Paradise Lost” and the book of Job, suggest that the Creator is not in complete control of his creation—that these stories are only coherent “if we do not lose ourselves in the dogmas of omnipotence and omniscience.” God, in other words, is more limited than we believe him to be, and if that's true, then no creator can be in total control of their creation. Just as the world took its own course, despite God's benevolent intentions, the consequences of the digital tools we create cannot always be foreseen in advance. And our limitations as creators will only become more pronounced as our technologies evolve in complexity. “The penalties for errors of foresight, great as they are now, will be enormously increased as automatization comes into its full use,” Wiener wrote. He proposed that we should regard human creators less like gods or prophets than like the character in a fable who discovers a magic lamp and must ask the genie to fulfill a wish. Creators must be extremely careful in how they word those wishes (genies, like machines, are prone to literalism)—as they cannot fully anticipate the ripple effects they might generate. Creators like Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg made platforms that turn users into limited creators themselves. Seemingly innocent posts can be taken out of context, go viral, and ruin the life of the poster turned creator—or find their way into some dank corner of the internet where they become fodder for conspiracy theories. These sites flatter us into believing we are the gods of our own cosmos, creating our own bespoke realities ex nihilo by choosing which accounts to follow, which posts to linger on, which threads to engage with. But each of these actions is encoded in algorithms that then perpetuate and intensify those choices, shaping and ultimately limiting our understanding of reality. Even as the breadth of our vision narrows, the echo chamber of consensus strengthens our belief in our views, leading us to believe that they are—we are—foolproof and omniscient. The favored solution to these problems is, increasingly, eschatological. Many long for the arrival of a new world:Web3, the blockchain-based postdiluvian cosmos that will return the internet to its original, decentralized perfection. Dorsey has himself expressed skepticism about the promise of this New Jerusalem. In December, he received blowback from the Ethereum/blockchain crowd for suggesting on Twitter that Web3 was already in the hands of venture capitalist firms like Andreessen Horowitz. When one of the investors of that firm tweeted a quote that is often mistakenly attributed to Mahatma Gandhi, Dorsey replied, “You're a fund determined to be a media empire that can't be ignored … not Gandhi.” Despite Dorsey's responsibility for some of these problems, his brand of skepticism might offer a model for the rest of us to emulate. Given our history of seeing the powerful as prophets, we would do well to remember that the “visionaries” of our age are not divine entities but ordinary humans who have stumbled on magical instruments they do not fully understand. (See: Elon Musk.) Whatever shape social media and the internet take in the future, one would hope we might reach a point where “constrained media”—Dorsey's preferred term for Twitter's minimalist ethos—becomes not merely an aesthetic criterion but a genuine ethical ambition.

This helps support our journalism.Learn more. Please also considersubscribing to WIRED If you wantedto create an exclusive online community with a shared goal, how would you go about it? If your answer is, \"with crypto, obviously!\" then you're in luck. DAOs (those are decentralized autonomous organizations, if that helps) are growing more popular with proponents of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. But what's up for some debate is what these communities are actually good for, and what kind of impact this purposeful gatekeeping can have on the real world. This week onGadget Lab, WIRED senior writer Gilad Edelman joins us to talk about the topsy-turvy world of DAOs and his own experience with creating one. Read Gilad’s story about his experimentalDAO for punchlines. Gilad recommends calling the IRS (yes, seriously).

It's called GoodeDAO, sir. MC: Yeah. Double sure. LG: Good vibes only in this DAO. MC: Well, I don't really know much about DAOs. LG: All right. Well, we have a colleague here at WIRED who really wants us to join his DAO, and there's aNew Yorkercartoon caption contest at the end of this wild journey. So have I intrigued you yet? MC: I'm going to say yes. LG: All right. Let's get started. [Gadget Labintro theme music plays] LG: Hi everyone. Welcome toGadget Lab. I'm Lauren Goode, I'm a senior writer at WIRED. MC: And I'm Michael Calore, I'm a senior editor at WIRED. LG: We're also joined by WIRED senior writer and DAO creator Gilad Edelman. Gilad, welcome back to the show. Gilad Edelman: Thanks for having me. LG: Should we just skip to your recommendations, because we know that's what everyone wants to hear from you. GE: No, because what everyone doesn't know is that I show up every time not having a recommendation in mind, and need the time that we're recording the podcast to think of one. LG: I love it. I love it. Maybe by the end of this, you're going to have created a new DAO and that's going to be a recommendation. GE: Only time will tell. LG: All right. Today, we are talking about—drum roll, please—the blockchain. Or specifically, we're talking about one way blockchain tech is being used by communities who are working towards a common goal. This is all very abstract. We're talking about DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations. Basically it means you have some online community, might be through something like a Discord server, and the participants who are participating need to buy into this community with crypto tokens. Now, as you can tell by the name alone, this whole thing is a little bit complex, which is why we asked Gilad, who is our resident Web3 reporter, to come on the show and walk us through this. MC: You might even say that you're our show's token Web3 reporter. GE: Nice. LG: Well played. MC: Thank you. LG: All right. So Gilad, you recently went to this conference in Denver. There were lots of crypto tokens there, there were just cases there. GE: Yeah. It was crawling with tokens. Yeah. LG: Yeah. Crawling with tokens. You ended up making a DAO, tell us about this. What have you done? GE: Yeah. So this DAO concept was on my radar. There've been some news stories about high-profile DAOs that failed spectacularly in various ways. And I was curious just to figure out what they actually entailed under the hood. So before going to the Ethereum conference, I texted my friend Jackson who works in blockchain-related stuff and is always up for goofy stuff, and asked if he knew how to make a DAO. He said absolutely. So while we were there, he and I and some of his coworkers just set aside some time to put one together, which is very in the spirit of these conferences, by the way, it's like a hackathon, which is very foreign to me as a journalist with no technical skills. So Jackson had suggested because you have to come up with, OK, what's the point of our DAO? What's our DAO going to do? So he suggested what if in our DAO the funniest people govern? To which I said, \"Oh, we could call it lmaoDAO.\" Like LMAO DAO. LG: Laughing my ass off, for those who are not done with the vernacular. GE: Yeah. To describe what everyone's not doing, when we take the time to explain acronyms to them. The secret of journalism is you just write the headline first and then do the story. So it felt like we were 70 percent there with a good name and—just kidding to our listeners out there, we don't write the headlines first. So then we had to figure out, OK, but what does that mean? And I had the thought of what if we tied it to theNew Yorkercaption contest. Which if listeners don't know, every week,The New Yorkermagazine, which is a fellow Condé Nast publication like WIRED, has in the back of the magazine and online, of course there's a cartoon with no caption and it's always some very whimsical situation, and the contest is to supply a funny caption for the cartoon. And this seemed nice because it was an off-the-rack weekly comedy competition, essentially. So we decided, OK, let's go with that. So that's the purpose. So then my question is, OK, what do you need to do to actually make a DAO? What are the atomic units of a DAO? The answer is, fundamentally, a DAO is a club or an organization for which possessing a certain custom token is the key to get in. It's like instead of a secret handshake, you distribute some custom token. MC: Well, it is a secret handshake, because you have to have that token, you have to have a wallet. So you're already talking about people who are into cryptocurrency, they are the people who can join DAOs, right? GE: Right. And like a secret handshake, it's really complicated, if your secret handshake's any good. That's right. When you talk about needing to possess a crypto token to be a member of something, you're immediately narrowing the aperture of who might participate, because you have to, yes, either have a crypto wallet or understand how to get one. And then there're all kinds of logistical hoops that you have to go through to get the token and then prove that you have it. So in our case, we invented a token out of thin air. LG: What did you call it? GE: It's just called lmao, L-M-A-O. MC: OK. So that's the name of the DAO and the name of the token. GE: Yes, exactly. And one of the guys who was helping me with this, he came up with a good idea because there's was a question of, OK, who's going to join? And so his idea was, well, we can use the Meal tokens, which were crypto-based of course at the conference as a proxy for everybody who attended the conference. And so we can just say everybody who is here gets these tokens and thus is eligible to join. And so he scraped the blockchain and just made a list, compiled the list of all those crypto wallets. And so we just dropped our bespoke token into those wallets. LG: OK. I'm going to step back a little bit. So you … GE: I sound insane right now, right? LG: No, no. Yes. GE: This is the most normal thing in the world. LG: So I thought that one of the features of the blockchain is that people who are participating, making transactions, are anonymous, but it sounds like you were able to access this list of people at the conference who had wallets and then invite them to your DAO. GE: Yeah. This is all of blockchain. It's all supposedly anonymous, but it's really pseudonymous because you're identified by some … MC: Your transaction. LG: By some element of the community too. I joined your Discord server as me, and so I would attach a wallet to that, right? And the wallet would in theory, be not identifiable, but I'm saying this is me. GE: Yeah. We've identified. Yes. Your wallet, it's a series of letters and numbers, this is your wallet address. And now that I have that information, I can absolutely monitor everything you do with that wallet, so be careful. LG: Be careful, he tells me. MC: So the purpose of your DAO is to create captions that you then enter intoThe New Yorkercartoon caption contest. GE: Right. MC: So what are the mechanics of it? How does it work? GE: Right. So far, we've just been talking about how do people get in. MC: Get in the DAO. LG: Which is an important part of it, by the way, because this barrier does still exist to this. So you're doing this as a proof of concept for a DAO. TheNew Yorkercaption contest is just a fun incentive to put out there. MC: So we've coveredhowDAO. I'm askingwhyDAO? GE: Why DAO? No, it's still how. Right. So by far, the most popular platform for doing DAO activities is Discord, the chat and discussion app. A lot of DAOs, including mine, are basically just a Discord group where you need a certain token to enter. Especially with mine, because there's no actual money involved, because I'm not out here trying to scam people. The token really is just like that secret handshake. So the way it works is you join this Discord server, there's an integration in Discord that can scan your wallet, essentially, and verify that you have the lmao coins. And once you do that, you have access to the locked channels. And then, so what we do is, every week, there's an internal contest where people submit within the Discord, and then the submissions that get the most, we made a custom laughing emoji. It's very cool actually. We take the top three or a Discord bot takes the top three vote getters and then we put those up to the official vote \"on this platform called Snapshot,\" which again, integrates with your wallet. Just back to your point, Lauren, about this being a proof of concept, it's kind of adisproofof concept, because what I suspected was that a lot of DAOs are not really decentralized or autonomous. And that's definitely the case for this one; it's very much my friends and me, we're the Discord admins. We literally havethe New Yorkersubscription necessary to submit the captions, that's all done manually. So it's really not decentralized in the sense of everybody having equal power. And what has been striking to me is that no one cares. The reaction I've gotten both in person when I was at the conference, explaining the project to people, and then subsequently is people just think it's fun, they think it's cool. And I think that's telling to me that I don't have people in the Web3 world coming up and saying, \"Hey, this isn't a real DAO.\" MC: Right. So what is a real DAO? Because I suspect it's something where, given the culture of DAOs, maybe you can tell us more about this, but it seems to be, it's a group of people deciding how to spend the funds that they have earned from their token holdings on some particular project. The community that they've built is around some hobby or some principle that they want to further in the world, and they come together, they make decisions about how to do that, and then they basically spend the funds that they've raised by building the DAO towards that. Is that right? GE: That is largely right. So to back up a little bit, what can a DAO do? Is an important question. If it's a \"real DAO\" you would want that to really be doing things on the blockchain. And you would want it to be built in such a way that everybody who's got the tokens gets some power and gets to vote in ways that are actually binding, that are written into the code of the DAO, so that whatever the community votes for happens. Well, I talked to a guy named Spencer Graham whose day job is doing DAO stuff, and he's an expert. And he was telling me that over the last year, a lot of DAOs have been created that are like mine, that are trying to do something in the real world. And the problem that arises there, is the blockchain can't do anything in the real world. Blockchain can't reach out outside of the blockchain and tell people to do stuff. So as soon as you want to interact with MeetSpace, say, by submitting something to a caption contest, you need people to do stuff. And people are not governed by votes that happen on the blockchain. Now, what is governed by votes that happen on the blockchain? Spending cryptocurrency. The only thing that you can govern on-chain is moving funds or tokens back and forth. So the closer a DAO gets to just being about allocating funds, the closer it is to recognizing this ideal of it's all a community of co-owners who are voting on things that are being executed through code. MC: Right. LG: I have so many more questions, but we need to take a quick break. And when we come back, we're going to have even more DAO jokes for you. Get it, like dad jokes, but DAO jokes. GE: They'll be at least as good as that one. MC: Yep. Guaranteed. [Break] LG: OK. So Gilad, we've talked about your experience creating lmaoDAO. MC: That's right. LG: That's right. lmaoDAO. So obviously building a community designed to develop the perfectNew Yorkerjoke is very, very important. We've talked about how these DAOs are defined by the exchange of cryptocurrency, the exchange of a specific token, and that's how you join the community. But in the example that you've given us, when you're talking about crowdsourcing a bunch of ideas to arrive at the best idea. Why does that require any kind of token? Why does that even require currency? GE: So two things. First, it absolutely it does not. Like I was saying before, issuing the crypto token is just a way to distribute membership, just like having a secret password or something. Now, for other DAOs that are about allocating money, the connection makes a little bit more sense because if what you're doing is coming together and making decisions about allocating resources that are on the blockchain, it's more logical to make people possess something on the blockchain to be members. As for your point though, about coming up with the best caption. I would not say that what the DAO does is come up with the best caption. And this gets at another question you might have about this form of organization. When you just have up several dozen at this point, it's well over a 100 random people who are interested in crypto and Web3 stuff vote. You're not necessarily going to get the funniest or cleverest results. And there's a lot of submissions in here that are jokes that only make sense if you're into Web3 and crypto stuff, which is not going to win over the cartoons editor atThe New Yorkermagazine, I don't think, although I did win last week. So I don't know which way that cuts. I won the internal vote. No, we didn't win the actualNew Yorkerone, no, come on. There weren't enough umlauts. So when it comes to the caption contest, who cares? But I do think this raises a question about the applicability of this model, because I think the really important thing about this DAO construct is that actually any Web3 platform or business idea or whatever you want to call it, just about all of them, actuallyhavethis structure of a DAO, and the reason is the whole sales pitch for Web3 is what? Well, decentralized, you have some ownership in it. And these are the key elements of these things called DAOs. But there are Web3 startups galore that are trying to build the blockchain version of Spotify or the blockchain version of Twitter or Instagram or Google. And what they all tend to have in common is there's some token, and everybody who is a user or otherwise involved in the platform gets some of those tokens. And in theory, they then get to vote on what happens, changes that are made to the platform, so that everybody gets control. And you might wonder, Hmm. Would a version of Instagram that's governed by majority rule, is that going to really lead to the best product? Is that really going to win— LG: Yeah. Chronological timeline. Right. MC: It'll be the Homer, right. It'll be the car designed by the person who just piles absolutely everything on and it becomes undrivable. GE: Right. You can imagine it going that way. You could also imagine only a small core of people either have the clout or own enough tokens, or just give enough of a crap to actually participate. But it is interesting that by far the most common story of dominant tech companies in the United States over the last 20 plus years is the super powerful visionary founder, right? Who's a piece of crap and throws sharp elbows both internally and to the competition and emerges victorious. And there's a lot of energy among Web3 enthusiasts around this idea of cooperative collective decisionmaking, but TBD how practical a truly leaderless organization is going to be when you want to actually create something that works. LG: And the idea is, if you were creating something where you had to pool resources or some mutual aid group that is using a fiat currency, a standard currency people would pay in, but then that doesn't allot any amount of power or ownership to the people who are participating in the community versus these tokens. GE: Right. This gets back to how the main thing you can do with the DAO is spend money. And so you could think of a DAO as basically blockchain-based crowdfunding, that's basically what it is. And so I asked Spencer Graham, the DAO expert, \"How much better than Kickstarter is this?\" And he said, in a lot of cases it's not. In a lot of cases, if you're just trying to raise money for something, and you live in the US and you have a bank account, and you're connected to the financial system, then a Kickstarter is probably going to be better. But as you say, Lauren, giving money to Kickstarter doesn't necessarily entail any ownership, although it could, right. That could be something that you promise as the person responsible for it. What Spencer did say was if we're talking about moving money across international borders, talking about jurisdictions that are not where people are not connected to the banking system, then you can start to see why, if you're trying to raise and donate or spend money, there are certain advantages to doing that using cryptocurrencies on the blockchain. MC: So your DAO is obviously very LOL, and we thank you for bringing more joy into the world, but what are some examples of DAOs that you've seen out there that are actually doing work that would impact policy or impact things that would touch upon the public sphere? GE: Well, I would actually push back a little bit, as silly as my DAO is, it has a much more concrete objective than most DAOs in that respect. LG: He's starting to sound like the founders we interview. No, please tell us more about how you're changing the world. GE: Yeah. I'm literally changing the world by bringing into existence submissions to a contest that wouldn't otherwise exist, and I think that's more than a lot of DAOs can say. I just want to point that out. LG: OK. GE: Would I use the wordvisionaryto describe myself? Yeah. But taking your— LG: Do you also have controlling shares of your DAO? GE: No. In fact, we did set it up so that the more lmao- … LG: Have you stacked the board with a bunch of— GE: I'm trying to answer you. LG: … white men who really support you? OK, go ahead. GE: I didn't stack it. That's just who is in Web3. It would've been really hard to stack it otherwise. We set it up so that when you win in the internal vote, you get more lmao tokens. And the more tokens you have, the more your vote counts in the official voting—there's this logic to it, right? It's like, if you've proven that you're funnier, then you should have more of a say over what gets submitted. But the finding is when we distributed the tokens in the place, we gave 100 to everybody who had one of those Meal tokens I was talking about, but we also gave 100 to everybody who had this NFT that was associated with the conference, but I don't have that NFT. So there are a lot of random people in the DAO who have twice as many lmao coins as me, so they have twice as much voting power. So in that way, it's a little bit decentralized. But then again, I'm the one who actually submits the caption. So ultimately I can do whatever I want. MC: Yeah. You do hold the key. GE: Yeah. LG: I think we've lost him. I think we've just lost him into this world. Did you just hear? He managed to get LMAO down tokens, NFTs, decentralized, did you say blockchain too? It's all in there. It's all there. My God, Gilad, please remember the little people when you make it big in the world of Web3. GE: Well, again, as I mentioned earlier, there's no actual money involved. So there's a limit to how big this is going to make me. LG: OK. So to get back to Mike's question. Yes. GE: Yeah. I would say there are DAOs that are spending money. There's quite a lot of enthusiasm for using this for charitable purposes, which is not crazy. It's a way to crowdfund, and so there's one called Giveth. I spoke with the very excitable person associated with Giveth, who was convinced this was really going to change the world. There's an organization called Gitcoin, which is basically a way to crowdfund different Web3 based projects, Ethereum-based project. So all this stuff tends to be very self-referential, but they say that they have so far raised and directed more than 50 million worth of cryptocurrencies. And they are gradually trying to turn themselves more and more into a DAO. You hear that a lot, some existing centralized project, but they have plans to DAO-ify themselves. MC: Yeah. It seems to me the ones that I see that gain traction in my world are DAOs who are trying to change journalism. DAOs where you buy in and there's some Gitcoin mechanism that makes $1 token worth $22. And they can use that money to hire fact-checkers, journalists can become independent by basically replicating the Substack model, except instead of using Substack, you do it on your own and you accept cryptocurrency for people to subscribe to your newsletter or whatever. It's difficult for me to see how this is entirely different than the systems that we've already set up, except for that you create this barrier of entry that the person needs to have a familiarity and a comfort with cryptocurrency in order to participate. GE: Yeah. Again, it goes back to that thing of, are you trying to do something that reaches into the real world? And if you are, this is probably a pretty dumb way to do it. MC: Right. GE: If you're just trying to spend crypto and have collective decisionmaking around that, it's plausible to me that there are situations where that's a good idea. But if you're trying to do something that involves interacting with the world, then all you're doing, as you say, Mike, is just making it harder for people to join. LG: But I am very intrigued by all of this. I think a lot about the podcast that you and I did a year ago with our colleague Kate Knibbs about NFTs, and it was called “WTF are NFTs,” if anyone would like to go back in the library and listen to that one. And we had a lot of similar questions about the whys and what does this stand for and what does it mean to have these tokens? And what does it mean to have the certificate for this thing that you supposedly have ownership of? And now we've just seen over the past year, NFTs have just become a part of our conversation as tech journalists, and as part of the broader tech community. And we're seeing different ways they're being used. And I have a feeling that DAOs are going to be part of the conversation for a while, right. As we see this building out of Web3 and how people are using it. So hopefully we look back on this episode and we're like, \"All right, we got it right maybe, and it all started with lmaoDAO.\" GE: Yeah. I think “sort of got it right” is a good standard to hold ourselves too. LG: I think so. I think that I'm open-minded about the ways in which this could be used and not feeling particularly attached to the ways the technology is being described or defined or categorized right now. I think in terms of payments in the earliest days of online payments, there's infrastructure there, and there's the exchange of goods happening that seems to make a lot of sense, but there's also this early rush to define things, and I'm not sure makes the most sense right now. GE: Part of the issue here is one that is fundamental to any conversation you have around crypto-related projects, which is, a lot of it really just depends on the underlying utility of blockchain-based systems and the underlying value of the cryptocurrencies in question. So an organizational structure that allows people to move cryptocurrencies around, the long-term value of that is only as much as the currencies have long-term value. And that's what's really in question right now; we're talking in a moment where the crypto market has cooled down a little bit from where it was a few months ago, but zoom out a little bit and it's still absolutely not so. Bitcoin and Ethereum are so valuable, but they have yet to prove any inherent value other than the market's confidence in people's ability to sell them for a higher price further down the road. And that fundamental question about what all this stuff is going to amount to and how much staying power it's going to have will go a long way to determining whether any of the Rube Goldberg contraptions that people are building on top of it has any real worth. LG: Right. Well, Gilad, thank you once again for trying to make sense of all this for us, we're going to take another quick break and come back with our recommendations. [Break] LG: Gilad, as our GOH as our DAO GOH. GE: Nice. LG: Guest of honor, what is your recommendation this week? GE: Well, mine is tailored to the approach of Tax Day, which is: Call the IRS. MC: You're recommending that we call the IRS. GE: Yes. When appropriate. So recently I got a letter in the mail from the IRS saying that I owed $7,000 or $8,000 in unpaid taxes and penalty associated with that. And I was pretty freaked out by that, but there was an explanation for why I hadn't paid that. So I wasn't sure what to do, and I asked people here at WIRED and various people connected me with their accountant or their tax preparer. So I emailed with one guy and he said, \"Yeah, you should submit these forms. I could do it for you for about $300.\" I thought about it, ‘Oh, it would save me some time. $300 versus $7,000 or $8,000 that I owe.’\" But then somebody else said you should call the IRS. So I called and I sat on hold for like an hour (they're busy), but then I got an absolutely lovely employee who I explained the situation to. And she told me just to send her the records that I had and she took care of it for me. And so I could have wasted $300, but instead I called the IRS and got it taken care of. The IRS is a much maligned agency, they're severely underfunded and understaffed, but in my interactions with them, there're pretty lovely people who work there. So if you have an issueandyou are in the right—because this advice won't work if you're an actual tax scofflaw. But I would say, if you have some issue with the IRS before you go paying somebody to handle it for you, don't forget step one of just calling and waiting on hold and until you get to talk to somebody. LG: I love it. I really thought you were going to say that you were fined because you were trading in crypto and it caught up to you. GE: No, my crypto schemes are at best revenue-neutral. MC: That's fantastic. LG: I just never thought … GE: Call the IRS. MC: The man comes around. LG: First of all, I never thought on theGadget Labpodcast, we'd ever have a recommendation for the IRS. Second of all, there's— MC: Calling the IRS. Picking up a telephone andcallingthe IRS. LG: Actually just calling and then waiting for them. And then the irony, the juxtaposition of us talking about all of these cryptocurrencies, these non-fiat currencies, where people are just avoiding their taxes, presumably, and here you are recommending the IRS. GE: The original Web3 technology is government. LG: Thank you for that recommendation. Mike, what is your recommendation this week? MC: Well, this is actually very on topic.The New Yorkernow has an Android app. GE: Cool. MC: So if you are a fan ofThe New Yorkerand you use an Android phone, you may have felt a little bit left out for the last, oh, I don't know, 12 years, becauseThe New Yorkerpublication has had an iPad app since 2010. They've also had an iPhone app since around that same time, and they have never had an Android app. So the Android app has finally arrived; it arrived this week. As aNew Yorkersubscriber with an Android phone, I downloaded it and I logged in and it's OK. It's OK. LG: The mere existence of it is exciting. MC: So I suppose we should disclose that we have the same parent company, right?The New Yorkeris a Condé Nast publication, WIRED is also a Condé Nast publication. So I'm sure there are people who I could Slack right now who worked on this, so I'll be gentle, but there's no search function. So if you know that you're looking for a story about a particular topic, you can't search for it, at least as far as I can tell. You can open up the most recent issue of the magazine and read everything except for the features, because those do not appear in the recent issues. They appear in back issues, I looked at some issues from 2014 and 2016, and I could see the features, but I looked at last week'sNew Yorkerand it had the front-of-book stuff and then the critics, but it didn't have the features. I thought that was weird. GE: What about the caption contest? MC: It does have that. It has all the cartoons and the poetry and fiction and all that. So that's all easy to find. Just a little odd. GE: Sounds like Mike's recommendation is get an iPhone. MC: Well, no, my recommendation is that you downloadThe New Yorkerapp, because I must say that the reading experience, reading the stories in a browser view that does not contain all the cruft that you normally get with a browser view is great. It's really nice, because their typography is excellent. You get to see all the photos in line, which you don't if you use something like Instapaper or Pocket to read. GE: I agree. Same with the WIRED app. It's just so much nicer. MC: Yeah. It's nicer to scroll through, and it's nicer to have the presentation layer there. GE: Yeah. MC: However, come on guys, search box. So that's my recommendation. LG: That's a good one. MC: DownloadThe New Yorkerapp if you're a subscriber, and if you're not, maybe subscribe. LG: All right. MC: What's your recommendation, Lauren? LG: I thought you'd never ask. My primary recommendation today would probably be that if you have pets and you have a pet carrier. to get ones that have hard sides, a hard plastic and maybe like a metal grate in the front. MC: Why would you be recommending this today? LG: There's a whole story there that involves me getting stitches and a tetanus shot this morning, but it's all good. So that's my first recommendation. My second recommendation- MC: Her cat clawed her carrier, chewed his way out of her carrier, and then scratched her and drew blood. GE: While she was driving her across— MC: While she was driving her car across the Golden Gate Bridge. GE:Honestly amazing that she made it to the office. LG: It actually is. And after this I have to go get antibiotics. It's all mess, I should have gotten a dog. But I honestly think having a toddler at this point would be easier. MC: No, probably not. LG: All right. No, my real recommendation this week is, we talked about Discord earlier and all three of us have been spending some time on Discord because of these DAOs. But our producer here, Boone Ashworth, who's also a contributing writer to WIRED. He wrote this fantastic guide to Discord a short while ago. And I have looked it up a bunch of times as I've tried to navigate my way through Discord. So if you're joining these communities, and you're just a little bit confused by the Discord interface or where you find any mentions of you or where your mailboxes are or how to join new communities, go to Boone Ashworth's guide to Discord on WIRED.com. MC: It is very good. LG: That's my recommendation. MC: And I can say that because I did not edit it. I usually edit Boone's stories, but this one, I don't think I edited. Yeah, it's great. LG: It's great. Alan, edited this one? Alan Henry. MC: I think so. LG: Yeah. OK. We could ask Boone, he's right here. GE: Some people are better seen, not heard. MC: Oh, harsh. LG: Well, Gilad, it has been an absolute pleasure having you back on the show. Thank you for joining us. GE: Thanks as always for having me. LG: Yeah. Or should I say TYVM. GE: Nice. LG: Mike, thanks as always for being a great cohost. MC: Of course. No problem. LG: Thanks for taking my phone call really early this morning. MC: You are welcome. LG: I called you from the Golden Gate Bridge. MC: You are welcome. LG: And thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter and on Discord. Just check the show notes; we'll include our Twitter handles there. This show is produced by the excellent Boone Ashworth. We'll be back next week. Actually I will be out for the next couple of weeks, so I won't be back next week, but Mike will be here, and then I'll be returning for a special episode, a pretaped episode on April 8th, so be sure to tune in for that one. Goodbye for now, and don't forget to tune in next week. [Gadget Laboutro theme music plays] LG: But I think I'm just going to use— GE: We can actually use other— LG: Trust Wallet or something. GE: I think it now is compatible with other wallets. My devs have done a lot of interesting work to increase the functionalities. MC: \"My devs!\" LG: “My devs.” I know we've lost him. We've really have lost him. GE: This is the thing about this whole shtick that people don't understand. People have no idea whether I'm trolling or not basically … which I am. LG: Boone, please put that in the show as an easter egg. Please include that, thank you very much.

    "news_title": "I Made a DAO, for Laughs. Want to Join? | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Hey folks. It'sGilad Edelman here, filling in for Steven this week.Go Giants! Last month, I headed to Colorado to attend ETHDenver, a conference devoted to all thingsWeb3: the movement to create a new, decentralized version of the web based on blockchain technology. While I was there, mingling with some 10,000 crypto enthusiasts (yes, I got Covid), I decided to dip into Web3 myself. So I created a DAO. DAO, pronounced “dow,” stands for “decentralized autonomous organization,” and it’s one of the buzziest of Web3’s many buzzwords. The idea is that a group of people can band together in a form of cooperative enterprise. To join one, you have to buy, or be given, a custom crypto token. That token grants you membership in the DAO and the ability to vote on what the organization does. What can a DAO do? Mostly, spend cryptocurrency. DAOs have been described as “an internet community with a shared bank account.” In theory, control is broadly distributed, with no individual or group in charge. Members can submit proposals for how to use the DAO resources in the form of “smart contracts” that automatically execute when enough members approve. It’s basically crowdfunding on the blockchain. In practice, DAOs have not always worked so smoothly. The original DAO—named, simply, The DAO—had a vulnerability in its code that allowed someone tosiphon offsome $50 million from its treasury. More recently, a group called Constitution DAO raised more than $40 million in Ethereum to buy an original copy of the US Constitution at auction. After the DAO was outbid by a billionaire, members discovered a new problem: The “gas fee” that accompanies any transaction on the Ethereum network was so high that most donors would lose a big chunk of their money when collecting their refund. Stories like that made me curious to learn more about the nitty-gritty of DAOs, so I asked my friend Jacksón Smith to help me. Jacksón was attending ETHDenver with his coworkers at the Learning Economy Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on improving education infrastructure, including through the use of blockchains. They were archetypal Web3 engineers: bright, curious white guys in their 20s. They gamely agreed to help me hack together a DAO. I gathered with the guys—and immediately started referring to them as “my core devs,” which seemed to impress other people at ETHDenver—on the second floor of a bar near the main conference space to knock around ideas. First, we had to decide what the DAO would do. Jacksón suggested it be devoted to humor, in which the funniest people get the most governing power. That led to an obvious name: lmaoDAO. Next we needed to figure out how the jokesters would prove themselves. I pulled aNew Yorkerout of my backpack. What if the goal of the DAO were to win the magazine’s weekly caption contest? Members could submit entries and vote on the funniest ones. Then we’d submit the winner each week on behalf of the DAO. The winner of our internal contest would be rewarded with some of our custom LMAO token so that, over time, people who win the contest repeatedly would get more voting power. Now that we had an idea, we had to build it. This presented all sorts of questions. For starters, how would we get people to join? Nathan, one of the devs, came up with a clever idea. Everyone who registered at the conference was given meal tickets in the form of a custom crypto token. We could scrape the blockchain for every wallet that held those meal tokens, then send those wallets some LMAO, which would grant them access. Access to what? By far the most popular tool for organizing a DAO is the discussion platformDiscord. We set up a Discord with a bot that helped members connect their crypto wallets to verify that they held LMAO. Then they could access the caption contest and other channels. As the professional writer in the group with zero technical skills, I was in charge of drafting the copy inside the Discord, including instructions for how to join and the rules for the contest. The guys kept working hard on the DAO as I drifted off to other parts of the conference. They even skipped the marquee Friday night event, a talk by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. By Saturday afternoon, we were ready to launch. We sent 100 LMAO to everyone with a meal token, and the conference organizers kindly promoted lmaoDAO on their Twitter account. A month later, lmaoDAO is chugging along. As I write this, there are 70 members, though most aren’t very active. We get somewhere between five and a dozen caption submissions per cartoon. We have yet to win the official contest (or even come close, frankly). But every week, either Jacksón or I announce the launch of a new contest. Members submit their captions in Discord and then vote on them on a Web3 platform called Snapshot. Finally, after a winner is declared on Sunday night, I manually submit it to theNew Yorkerwebsite. How decentralized is this? How necessary is crypto to organizing a caption contest? The answer to both questions is: not at all. We have vague plans to build out more decentralized governance, but so far, my friends and I control everything. Blockchain is supposed to be “trustless” technology that removes the need for intermediaries, but the DAO members have to trust us to do what we say we’ll do because we’re the only ones with admin privileges in the Discord, access to theNew Yorkeraccount, and control over the LMAO treasury. Our DAO is nothing more than a club that conditions membership on the possession of a certain crypto token. This is evidently quite common. Any DAO that tries to do something besides spend cryptocurrency must interact with meatspace, explains Spencer Graham, who works full-time building tools for people to create DAOs (and who, I’m pleased to note, is a member of lmaoDAO). That requires human beings to do stuff—which means everything can’t be decentralized on a blockchain, governed by code. “Six to nine months ago, there was an explosion of Web3 communities” that all had a custom token, a Discord, and a bunch of people voting on polls, Graham says. The creators’ pitch was that “We, the founders, are going to take what the polls say and enact that—or rather, people are going to trust us to do so.” That pretty much describes lmaoDAO to a T. Graham points out that for a DAO like ours, where there is no money involved—we invented LMAO out of thin air and give it away for free—this kind of trust is low-risk. For DAOs that actually spend crypto, it’s much more important to set up real transparency and democratic governance. So if we aren’t spending money, and I’m actively managing it, what’s the point of having a DAO? The best answer I can give is that it’s fun. Creating a DAO, or any Web3 application, is not unlike designing a game. You have to decide what the rules are, what incentives to create, and how to make sure people want to keep playing. The mix of game theory and novel tech helps explain why people like my friends at Learning Economy are willing to devote time to creating and running these things. You, Plaintext reader, are welcome to join. All you need is acrypto wallet. The first hundred people toclick hereand submit their wallet addresses will receive 100 LMAO and access to the contest. Still think Web3 is a joke? Prove it. They say time heals all wounds; can it even heal a broken Congress? On Tuesday, the Senatevoted unanimouslyto make Daylight Savings Time permanent beginning in 2023. At first glance, it was a remarkable display of bipartisanship and whatever the opposite of gridlock is. On closer inspection, as Buzzfeed Newsreported, it appears that some ambitious Senate staffers basically snuck the bill through when no one was looking. Good for them. Permanent daylight savings would mean we’d get to enjoy later sunsets all year round, at the modest expense of some Americans waking up more often in the dark. Supporters of the Senate bill, which has yet to be voted on in the House, argue that extending the hours of evening sunshine will cut down on traffic accidents, crime, and energy use. The first person to make the connection between energy consumption and daylight hours is widely believed to be Benjamin Franklin. In 1794, a few years before Steven Levy began his journalism career, the polymath and founding father wrote a satiricalletterto theJournal of Parisrelaying his “discovery” that the sun illuminated his bedroom when a noise woke him up at 6 am, long before he meant to rise. Unlike candles, Franklin noted, sunlight was free. From there, he wrote, “my love of economy induced me to muster up what little arithmetic I was master of.” Franklin did some back-of-the-envelope math to estimate how much money could be saved if Parisians toned down their night-owl lifestyle: I took for the basis of my calculation the supposition that there are one hundred thousand families in Paris, and that these families consume in the night half a pound of bougies, or candles, per hour. Franklin estimated that the average Parisian woke up seven hours after sunrise, leaving “seven hours of course per night in which we burn candles.” (Apparently, waking up at noon was normal in Paris at the time.) Then he ran the numbers. In the six months between the 20th of March and the 20th of September, there are Nights: 183 Hours of each night in which we burn candles: 7 Multiplication gives for the total number of hours: 1,281 These 1,281 hours multiplied by 100,000, the number of inhabitants, give: 128,100,000 One hundred twenty-eight millions and one hundred thousand hours, spent at Paris by candle-light, which, at half a pound of wax and tallow per hour, gives the weight of: 64,050,000 Those 64,050,000 pounds of candles were costing Parisians, he wrote, about 96,075,000 livres tournois, the currency at the time. An immense sum! that the city of Paris might save every year, by the economy of using sunshine instead of candles. Imagine if Franklin had lived to see solar panels. Steven asks, “Will Ukraine slow down antitrust/anti-tech fervor in DC?” Big Tech certainly hopes so. TheWashington Post’s Cristiano Limareportedon Wednesday that the industry’s lobbyists have latched on to a new argument against antitrust legislation. Two pending Senate bills would prevent dominant platforms from self-preferencing and force Apple and Google to put rival app stores on a playing field level with their own. The lobbyists argue that those measures would prevent platforms from banning the purveyors of Russian propaganda. But Lima notes a key weakness in that theory: “Both of the antitrust bills explicitly exclude organizations owned or controlled by foreign governments from using their protections as legal tools, as well as any groups that pose a national security risk.” More generally, the tech companies might be praying that a version of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” takes hold in Washington. After all, Russia has banned Facebook and Instagram, along with Twitter. Doesn’t that make those companies the good guys? Not in the eyes of US antitrust enforcers, I suspect. Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter, the leaders of the Federal Trade Commission and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, respectively, have spent years waiting for the opportunity to beef up antitrust enforcement against Big Tech (and other industries). They know the big social media platforms are important vectors for free speech—which is one reason they want to keep the market competitive. And the Biden administration sees antitrust, broadly speaking, as one of very few tools available tocrack downon inflation. That said, Big Tech’s best hope right now might be for the war to keep occupying the attention of Congress and the White House, helping the industry run out the clock until November. The GOP is expected to sweep the midterm elections, leading to divided government and making any kind of substantive legislation even less likely than it already is.

    "news_title": "Katie Haun Launches Haun Ventures Crypto Fund | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Up until aboutfive years ago, Katie Haun’s career path wouldn’t have led you to believe she’d end up becoming one of the most prominent investors in thecryptocurrencyindustry. After clerking for US Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in the early 2000s, Haun worked as a federal prosecutor for more than a decade. It was Haun’s investigations into white-collar crimes that eventually prompted her to dive deep intoBitcoin-related crimes—turns out, there are some nefarious use cases for emerging technologies. But when Haun left the federal government and joined the famed venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, a connection that was made through her board appointment at Coinbase, her conversion to crypto champion was complete. Now Haun is branching out and launching her own fund, named Haun Ventures. It’s a big one: Haun and a team of eight others (so far) have raised $1.5 billion, making it one of the largest debut venture funds raised by a woman. Haun Ventures is focusing onWeb3companies, which will be underpinned by, of course, crypto. A third of the fund raised will go toward early-stage companies, and the remaining $1 billion will be part of an acceleration fund. Haun’s fund, like the broader Web3 world, is an amalgamation of players, with recognizable names alongside unlikely ones. The investment team and board of advisors comprises executives from A16Z, Coinbase, Airbnb, Shopify, and Jigsaw; actor and writer Mindy Kaling has joined as an advisor; and Haun has confirmed investments in Autograph, OpenSea, Aptos, and Moonwell. If you’re not yet sure what those companiesdo, you’re not alone. Web3 is currently thecatch-all termfor what many technologists see as the next big phase of the internet. One of the promises of this next iteration of the web is that it will be “decentralized,” shifting power away from the Big Tech firms of the past 20 years and back into the hands of the inventors and creators who want to build a better web. But how decentralized will this next web be if all of the same power players are involved? And what makes Haun Ventures different from other large crypto funds? This conversation has been edited for clarity and length. WIRED: So, you’re formally announcing Haun Ventures. What is the biggest differentiator between what you plan to do at Haun Ventures versus what you did at A16Z (Andreessen Horowitz), especially considering that you still have such a close working relationship with A16Z—they’re funding you, and there’s actually overlap in some of your investments? Katie Haun: Yeah, that's such a great question. Look, I think there will be some similarities and there will be some differences. I think Marc [Andreessen] and Ben [Horowitz] pioneered this “founders first” culture that we very much hope to live up to and emulate. And that's especially important in crypto and Web3. Because, to be candid, a lot of founders who are building right now in that space, who are building some of the most exciting products and services, don't actually need capital. They have their choice of capital, really. And so the importance of the founders-first culture that Marc and Ben really pioneered is important. On the other hand, obviously we're very different. We're much smaller. So our scale is also small. A16Z built this team of networked services—they service fintech companies, enterprise, consumer, crypto. I was part of that, but we’re not going to offer a whole suite or network of services. We do have some exceptionally skilled operators, and we’re going to look to deliver those “hero moments” where we can really uniquely add value to the projects we invest in. Your fund has been described as a truly “crypto-native” fund, whereas at other firms, like A16Z, there might be a second fund or even a third fund devoted to crypto investments, but that’s not the main purpose of the firm. How concerned are you about any kind of lack of diversification? Like if crypto crashes, or if Web3 becomes a series of functions or features built on top of a preexisting web, as opposed to leading to the formation of entire companies— You’re asking about our decision to myopically focus on or go all in on crypto and Web3, as opposed to having different verticals and options. I’ve spent almost a decade in this space, and I certainly see this as the future. So I’m not worried about the opportunity set. And I'm also not worried about diversification because of how dramatically the space and the ecosystem have grown. Let me tell you a little bit about what I mean by that. In the early days of the internet, you wouldn’t have just said, “I’m going to make a social media investment or a cloud investment.” You would have had your developer tools play, your cloud play, your social media play. Similarly, here it’s an ecosystem. We plan to invest in the three layers of the stack. Layer one is Web3 protocols. Layer two is around interoperability, scalability. And then layer three is the application layer, kind of the consumer-facing layer. And crypto-adjacent is very much in our thesis. We think things like identity, like security, like insurance will become very important categories. I think our decision to hold tokens and also to hold equity is itself diversification within this ecosystem. You know, there are a lot of funds out there that are doing crypto investments, but they are not participating in the token ecosystem. We will be long-term holders of tokens. For people who are not so deeply steeped in the world of Web3 and crypto and NFTs, what does it mean that your firm is going to hold tokens? When I say hold, I mean as opposed to being traders, because you do have crypto hedge funds that are trading in and out positions of tokens. Obviously, there can be fluctuation in price. And we don't plan to do that. We plan to take long-term positions. Because we’re a venture capital firm, we make what I used to say were 7- to 10-year bets. I think the way crypto moves so quickly, maybe that's more like 5-7 years now. But it's still long-term focused. People sometimes ask me, “Well, couldn't I just go buy tokens myself?” Whether that's Ethereum, whether that's Solana … I’m talking about making investments in ecosystems. It's not enough anymore to just show up and make an investment. You've got to actively participate in the governance of these protocols. The other thing that I think isn’t widely appreciated about tokens is that a lot of them start out as not subject to dilution. Whereas with equity investments, you get diluted between a seed round or series A round or an exit. So just in terms of your question about owning tokens, we just think that tokens are really a new business model of the Web3 ecosystem. So you mentioned earlier that part of your positioning as a true, crypto-native fund is that you want to appeal to entrepreneurs because some entrepreneurs have their choice of VCs they can go to. The capital is flowing. But why would Web3 entrepreneurs actually need VCs? And if Web3 is all about the power of the masses, and decentralization, I’m wondering how real that proposition is, given that the space is already centralized around a small number of power players and gatekeepers. I think decentralization and centralization exist on a spectrum. Like I said, a lot of these founders don't need venture capital investors. They can go to different funding sources, and frankly, a lot of them could self-fund for some period of time. But a founder recently said to me, “We're not talking to venture capital firms for this round,” and I said, “Well, why are you talking to us?” And his comment was, “Because you're not a venture capital firm. You're a venture contributor.” What does that mean? That means that we're doing more than just bringing capital. If you think of the first era of venture, it was just capital. And by the way, there are still some venture capitalists where the model is just to give capital. Then there's a second era of venture capital investing, and it was capital plus services. What we're doing is we're going a step further and we’re contributing to the project. We also look to drive system change, which is more than just bridge-building between projects in the Web3 ecosystem and regulators and policymakers. It's also folks in the media industry, it’s folks in academia, it’s researchers … We've seen Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook all start talking about what they're going to do in the Web3 and crypto space. So I think building bridges between those communities and driving system change is one way in which we expect to be venture contributors. It just seems there are at least two disparate conversations about Web3 that are happening right now. And one is about entrepreneurs building this new version of the web from the ground up, they’re bootstrapping new applications and ideas for the web … and then it feels like there's this land grab or power grab that's happening on the money side, where the same players as before are saying,How can we get in early? How can we get our returns? Well, we’re not looking for quick returns. We are looking for returns for our LPs [limited partners], however. We’re looking for that very much over the long term. I think in terms of your question about centralization and decentralization, there's a lot of black and white in this ecosystem. There's a lot of noise. Obviously, the internet of value is prone to hype sometimes. I think that one thing I try to do is I try to be nuanced. And this exists on a spectrum. One thing that our team sees is that right now the current paradigm is really weighted too heavily toward these walled gardens that are really extracting a lot of value and not giving back a ton of value. And I won't name names of those walled gardens, but I think that crypto technologies will increasingly put pressure on these big tech platforms. And I think that over the long term, that’s really good for consumers and that's really good for creators. In arecentFortunearticlewritten about you, Amy Wu [who leads FTX’s $2 billion crypto fund] was quoted as saying, “Regulatory compliance is the most important topic in crypto this year.” What are your thoughts on that? And if you agree, what does the regulatory environment actually look like for cryptocurrency this year? I don’t want to slap a label on it and say it’sthemost important issue because there are a lot of pressing issues, but I think it is one of the most important and will continue to be long beyond this year. Regulation and policy, at a global scale, are going to be topics we’re talking about far beyond 2022 and far beyond 2023. What does the regulatory picture look like? That’s a really complicated question. We see that it’s shifting. One thing we’re very encouraged by isthe executive orderthat came out of the Biden administration a couple weeks ago, for two reasons—one, it directseveryagency in the federal government to come up with a strategy for crypto and Web3. I think that's a reflection of what I said earlier, that this landscape is about much more than just financial products and services, and the EO is a recognition of that. It's also recognition that crypto and Web3 aren't going anywhere. The second reason we were encouraged by the executive order is because it also directs those agencies to engage with industry and academics and people outside the government. When I was working in government in the early days, working alongside these technologies, one of the hard things was for someone in the government to keep up with, like, “Where is the training? What are the resources? How do you learn about these technologies?” So, I think bringing in the private sector, bringing in academia, bringing in nonprofits and a variety of different voices is really important. I also think if you zoom out, one of the things we see in the regulatory picture is the creation of certain crypto hubs and Web3 hubs. There are different jurisdictions that are really jockeying for position to be a bastion of regulatory clarity and a welcome zone for crypto and Web3 developers and projects. It’s kind of similar to—you know how a lot of corporations are headquartered in Delaware? I think a lot of hubs throughout the world want to be Delaware for crypto. Delaware became a hub for corporations, at least in this country, because their courts developed a subject matter expertise and they had a favorable regulatory environment in that state. And we see a similar thing happening on a global scale with different hubs emerging that are really trying to attract the best talent. But I think the key thing is we'll still be talking about a need for regulatory clarity in the year to come. As someone who worked as a prosecutor and who now is such a champion of crypto, you kind of speak both languages. I’m wondering if you ever see yourself going back to the public sector. I have no plans to go back to the public sector. I will say that I really believe that there's a lot of societal benefit that can come about from Web3 and crypto, and I'm feeling right now like my highest and best use is working with the founders and builders ushering in what I think is a positive societal change. That's why I was a prosecutor for as long as I was. I wanted to have meaningful work and feel like I was making a positive contribution. And I feel like my highest and best use right now is in the crypto ecosystem. There’s a need for a lot of bridges to be built between different worlds. There are a lot of myths that I still encounter in crypto. The fact of the matter is that crypto and Web3 still feel very inaccessible to very many people in the world, no matter your background, no matter your education level, no matter where you come from. And I want to spend my time showing people that anyone can learn about crypto.

    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Please also considersubscribing to WIRED When Mark Zuckerbergannounced in October 2021 that Facebook waschanging its name to Meta Platforms, the news made waves well beyond Silicon Valley. Overnight, it became the talk of the town in China as well, triggering fierce debates between founders, investors, and their corporations. Buy This Book At: If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism.Learn more. It’s no surprise that the idea ofthe metaversethrilled the Chinese tech community. Every few years an overarching theme emerges, rallying talent and capital. The ability to ride such waves, or better, dictate and shape them, equates to the power to capture fortunes. The metaverse promised an entire world to explore and conquer beyond smartphones, a chance to leapfrog the giants of today that have come to dominate mobile computing. Even on a personal level, I’ve witnessed over the years countless classmates and friends grow enthralled by such cycles, chasing investment bubbles in real estate and private equity, working as civil servants for the government before moving on to build startups. Within tech, the investment themes have in the span of just a few years evolved from desktop-based social media and games to mobile messaging to online-to-offline services, and now the metaverse. And Pony Ma Huateng, the reclusive chair and cofounder of the Chinese tech conglomerateTencent Holdings, has always been a step ahead. Commanding an entertainment and social media empire rivaling Meta in scope, Pony Ma in fact publicly laid out a vision for building something very similar to the metaverse just a few months before Zuckerberg announced his company’s name change. Pony Ma called it the Quan Zhen internet, meaning “all-real” internet. The concept, while vaguely defined, encompasses using the web to meld manufacturing and work, and overlaps with many aspects of the Facebook cofounder’s vision. But this iteration could turn out very differently, as it will be born under the watchful eye of Beijing from day one. “MetaveRse” first appearedas a word in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novelSnow Crash, which depicted a world gripped by hyperinflation. Stephenson envisioned a world based on anarcho-capitalism. And like all cyberpunk literature, the story is underlined by strong tones of antiauthoritarianism. Assuming the Chinese government sees merit in the technology, the metaverse could in the future be split into two: China and the rest of the world. Much like the internet, the world’s second largest economy will likely shield its netizens from the rest of the global metaverse. That China’s internet industry has grown to its size today is in part because the government kept it on a loose lead while hiding it behind a firewall. The country was more preoccupied with controlling gas, oil, telecommunications, finance, and traditional media. Virtually unhindered, Western capital and local entrepreneurs found opportunities in Communist China to devise a formula that married global capital and technology with the world’s largest population. The metaverse will be a different story. While local government officials in cities like Shanghai seem to embrace the concept, announcing their intention to encourage its application in public services, social entertainment, games, and manufacturing, others are far less sanguine. Chinese economist Ren Zeping pointed out the dangers of a metaverse, accusing it of potentially causing lower marriage and birth rates—the logic being that if people are too busy entertaining themselves in the virtual world, they wouldn’t need to seek connections in the real one. Even matters as inherently apolitical as health policy could spur clamp downs. China is currently waging a battle against myopia among its youth, blaming gaming companies like Tencent for exacerbating the problem. A generation of children masked by VR headsets doesn’t help the cause. And that’s in addition to authorities wagging their fingers at the “lie flat” movement, a philosophy that’s gained currency among youths seeking to check out of the relentless corporate rat race. Despite the uncertainty, companies and investors aren’t holding back when it comes to investing in and preparing for what could be the next big thing. The number of applications for trademarks related to the metaverse tripled in the three months after Zuckerberg’s switch to more than 8,500 in China. Tencent’s making preparations as well. Martin Lau, its president, has said that the company has the technology and know-how to build the metaverse, thanks to its enormous gaming and social media cred. It’s already the Chinese local publisher for Roblox’s gaming platform, which allows users to create virtual worlds and is regarded by many as a viable early iteration of the future metaverse. Within Tencent, executives project that the industry needs at least another five years to get to the point where people will consider the technology legit. It’s not that far off. Yet there’s another concept on the horizon:Web3, an internet restored to its decentralized origins by building services on top of blockchains or managed and accessed on peer-to-peer distributed networks. Corporations from the Web2 era are dispatching teams internally to develop their own versions of Web3, incorporating such services onto their own platform to stay relevant. Tencent is no exception, in that it’s brainstorming ways to stake out a plot in the future internet landscape, but it faces unique constraints. The ideal version of Web3 “is an executable Magna Carta—the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot.” The promises of Web3 are enticing enough, so much so that corporations and venture capitalists are already rushing into the space, creating memes that have made the concept somewhat amorphous. Skeptics argue it’s ironically perverting the notion of Web3, as they’re betting that it will yield the next Apple—reasserting corporate dominance in a realm that’s supposed to champion the little guy. Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has become one of the biggest critics, arguing that far from democratizing the web, this current frenzy is but another tool of venture capitalists. Elon Musk has said it’s just marketing hype. Developing Web3 in China is almost impossible, as everything about the concept contradicts the government’s central priorities, namely maintaining control over content and infrastructure. And by limiting its own technology corporations, China might lose out on what could become the next wave. All of thishas to be enormously frustrating for someone like Pony Ma. The self-proclaimed geek who as a child gazed at the stars and pondered how he could better the universe has in a sense realized his goal and finds himself now at a crossroads, dwelling on what legacy he will leave behind. He found his calling as one of the pioneers of the global mobile internet, linking billions to vast new realms of on-the-go mobile entertainment and communications. He helped solidify emotional connections between lovers, families, and friends, even as they ventured across the Pacific, helping them keep in touch and see each other.  Life has become so convenient that the only device needed when traveling in China is a phone. In the process, Pony Ma gained unimaginable wealth and influence beyond his wildest dreams. Now everything may be out of his hands. The empire he’s created may have grown too vast and powerful for the Chinese government to stomach, a beast that needs to be tamed, a tool that needs to be harnessed to ensure the rule of the Party. In that environment, attempting to blaze new trails could be a minefield. The milieus ofReady Player OneandSnow Crashdon’t inspire the most faith in humanity’s future, depicted soul-crushing struggles against all-seeing, all-powerful institutions. It’s a vision that some would argue is materializing in China, which has put in place the world’s largest and most effective surveillance and control mechanisms. Pony Ma’s conundrum is how to propel Tencent into the future while appeasing his political masters, an incredibly delicate maneuver with unimaginable stakes. Given the extraordinary achievements of the past two decades, some may argue Pony Ma is duty-bound to try. Who better than the visionary founder of the world’s largest online entertainment empire to square that circle, to fashion a formula that will work for a fifth of the global population? And so the billionaire might not be falling back anytime soon. Perhaps it’s not even up to him. For the Party, it would be much easier to have one mighty all-knowing yet obedient company to rule all than play whack- a-mole with potentially disruptive forces. Some choices Pony Ma has made following China Tech’s recent annus horribilis offer clues to his thinking for the future, or at least an overarching stance for public consumption and his political overlords. In the past decade, when Pony Ma reorganized Tencent and opened up the company’s platform, he wanted the company to become an infrastructure-like operation, to become the equivalent of water and electricity for the internet. Fast-forward to now, Pony Ma has made a U-turn, telling staff at an internal 2021 year-end gathering that Tencent is just a dime a dozen, a beneficiary of the vast progress the country’s made. “Tencent is not an infrastructure-service company and can be replaced at any given moment,” local mediaLate Postreported him saying. “In the future, when Tencent services the country and society, the company needs to make sure it doesn’t overstep, be a good assistant.” In theI Ching, also known as theBook of Changes, the ancient Chinese script confers a note of wisdom: that an overconfident dragon will have cause for remorse. If Pony Ma’s generation of entrepreneurs spent the first half of their lives swimming upstream like carps to leap over the gates of the Yellow River hoping to become dragons, then, following ancient wisdom, the second part of their fate lies in knowing when to bow out—or perhaps becoming part of the system they once wished to change.

    "news_title": "Why OpenSea's NFT Marketplace Can’t Win | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. What is areal ape? On OpenSea, the internet's most popular NFT marketplace, answering that question incorrectly can be costly. Last year,Bored Apes—cartoon primates linked to unique cryptocurrency tokens—skyrocketed in popularity. Now the cheapest cost $309,000, and OpenSea is crawling with imitations and rip-offs. Two projectsfeaturing flipped versions of original Bored Apes,called Phunky Apes Yacht Club (PAYC) and PHAYC, vied for the title ofauthenticknockoff of the coveted simians; other apes, of which there are many, were just straight-up copypastas. In December OpenSea banned PAYC and PHAYC, a step that elicitedgrumblesfrom the crypto crowd whose splurge has fueled the recent NFT craze. The move went against OpenSea’s self-styled image as a champion ofWeb3, a decentralized version of the internet free from censorship or gatekeeping. A few days later,a blog postby former Signal CEO Moxie Marlinspike, whoseexperimental NFTswere removed by OpenSea, gave the impression that OpenSea risked becoming another traditional tech platform, the“How do you do, fellow kids?”to the edgy Web3 insurgency. OpenSea is trapped between a rock and a hard place: Its phenomenal growth has brought it more revenue, partnerships with tech giants like Twitter, and funding, but also a cartload of headaches as the company struggles to keep up with emerging security incidents and endless copycat NFTs. If OpenSea gets around to handling those issues, it could face a scornful backlash from cryptocurrency hard-liners, which has already resulted in the launch of a rival NFT marketplace overtly designed to poach its customers. On the other hand, digital art creators, for whom the rise of NFTshas repeatedly been described as a boon, think that OpenSea does not go anywhere near far enough in banishing plagiarism and bad behavior. The person behind @NFTTheft, aTwitter accountdevoted to exposing plagiarism on OpenSea and other NFT stores, is scathing. “When I first heard the word ‘OpenSea,’ I thought that piracy was its goal from the start,” they say, requesting anonymity out of fear of harassment from plagiarists. “This is now the main place for piracy.” One can pinpoint the exact decisions that made OpenSea a success story and a huge problem in the same breath. In December 2020, the company announced that everyone would be allowed to “mint” theirNFTs on the platform free of charge;three months later, that was compounded by the announcement that NFT collections wouldno longer need OpenSea’s previous approvalto be listed. That model was in stark contrast with that of highbrow NFT platforms like Nifty Gateway or Superrare—which featured highly curated art collections—and ended up making OpenSea the biggest NFT marketplace on the web. In August 2021, itreported a monthly transaction volume of $3.4 billion, equivalent to $85 millionin revenue, as OpenSea extracts a 2.5 percent transaction fee. A venture capital bonanza followed from marquee players such as investment houses Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm, and Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher,giving the company a valuation of $13.3 billion. In January, Twitter announced that it would use OpenSea’s API to let people create hexagonal NFT-based profile pictures. (Twitter declined to comment on the wisdom of partnering with OpenSea in light of the recent incidents.) Then, on January 26, OpenSea tried to curtail the amount of fake NFTs on the site. It announced that free, unlimited minting was coming to an end: Each user would be limited to up to five collections, each containing no more than 50 NFTs. Backlash ensued, and thedecision was reversed within 24 hours. In a backpedaling Twitter thread, OpenSea stated that over 80 percent of NFTs minted that way consisted of “plagiarized works, fake collections, and spam.” One day later, another PR disaster. OpenSea users started complaining thatbots were on the prowl to exploitan outdated listing mechanism that would allow them to snap up NFTs at below-market prices. The design flaw led OpenSea to issue “over 2K ETH [$6.2 million] in reimbursements to community members who were impacted,” according to company spokesperson Allie Mack. That came on top of reports ofNFT thefts,market manipulation, andsecurity vulnerabilitiesthat dogged the platform throughout 2021. OpenSea has been paying the consequences of its lightning growth. Launched in 2017 with backing from startup accelerator Y Combinator, as of March 2020 the company counted five employees when it suddenly found itself at the epicenter of a global NFT frenzy. “OpenSea was really at the foundation of the NFT industry, and they were just not able to support this crazy growth,” says Gauthier Zuppinger, cofounder of NFT data provider NonFungible. Zuppinger has met OpenSea cofounders Devin Finzer and Alex Atallah on several occasions and describes them as “shy, focused, hard-working,” more akin to Mark Zuckerberg than to brash crypto-bros. Still, OpenSea was booming too much too fast. “Even with a lot of profit, you're not always able to hire the right guys at the right time, and build the required infrastructure to support such crazy growth,” Zuppinger says. These issues might just come down to growing pains. “As you scale a company, you're going to be introducing more people—and as you introduce more people, your level of code quality is going to vary across the different hires,” says Taylor J. Dawson, a software engineer who worked as OpenSea’s founding engineer from February to June 2020, and now works for blockchain infrastructure company Blocknative Corporation. Dawson interprets OpenSea’s struggles as natural consequences of the company’s expansion, and stresses Finzer and Atallah’s “attention to detail” when it comes to developing their platform. Yet OpenSea’s attention to detail didn’t seem to extend to security, arguably the most crucial part of the platform. The company hired its first chief security officer in December 2021. Before that, OpenSea’s Mack says, the platform’s security was overseen by vice president for engineering Dan Roelker, who had worked for DARPA’s cyberwarfare program from 2011 to 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile. Roelker himself joined the company in August 2021. Dawson says that when he worked for OpenSea in 2020, no one in particular was in charge of security. A cryptocurrency expert with knowledge of OpenSea’s operations, speaking anonymously to avoid jeopardizing potential business relationships with the company, describes OpenSea’s course of action on security matters as “years behind what needs to be done.” They blame OpenSea's own decision to make NFT minting open and free to everyone as the cause for the explosion of NFT plagiarism that the platform was unable to quash. The activist behind @NFTTheft says that, as of October 2021, the majority of plagiarized art reported to the Twitter account concerned NFTs minted on OpenSea. That, the person behind the handle says, is a shift from March 2021. “Before, plagiarism was distributed among different marketplaces: now, OpenSea is the main source,” they say. @NFTTheft says that thieves initially made NFTs out of artwork scraped from DeviantArt—an online artist community that has beenaggressively fighting art theft—but that more recently they started lifting images from Twitter or Steam. In their view, OpenSea is too slow at responding to reports of stolen art and copyright infringement, which they say can take up to a week. In @NFTTheft’s opinion, OpenSea has no incentive to remove plagiarized art from its platform, as that would alienate customers who have unwittingly purchased illicit NFTs, who would end up with no NFT and no refund from OpenSea. Mack, the OpenSea spokesperson, says that the company’s “policies prohibit plagiarism and copyminting, which we regularly enforce in various ways, including delisting and in some instances, banning accounts,” and that OpenSea is developing technology—including automated moderation, image recognition, and enhanced search tools—to better address the problem. Mack says that the company is aiming to respond to customer reports in less than 72 hours on average (rather than the week artists claim it takes to get a response) and is planning to have a team of “nearly 200 people” in customer support by the end of the year, having already added more than 100 in the past two months. It’s debatable whether that will be enough to win over @NFTTheft and other digital artists, as well as the advocates of decentralization and cryptocurrency, many of whom are avid NFT buyers. Centralized content moderation is kryptonite for the crypto crowd—a mark of the Big Tech companies that, in the Web3 narrative, are supposedly destined for the dustbin of history. And OpenSea’s Web3 credentials have already been called into question: The company’s closed-source technology, its decision to raise funds from VCs rather than by selling a token to its supporters, andrumors of an imminent IPO—later quashed—earned it hostility in some quarters. That culminated, on January 10, in the launch of rival NFT marketplace LooksRare. LooksRare adopted a more decentralized architecture, redistributing the ether cryptocurrency from its 2 percent transaction fees to users who had bought its $LOOKS tokens; crucially, LooksRare doled out free $LOOKS tokens to users with a significant history of trading on OpenSea, in a bid to lure them away from the platform—a move cryptocurrency mediadubbed a “vampire attack.” “LooksRare was made to create an NFT marketplace that’s by NFT people, for NFT people,” says a LooksRare spokesperson going by the name Slug, relaying comments from several members of the all-pseudonymous management team. “$LOOKS stakers earn platform fees, whereas the platform fees from most other markets we’re aware of go to a central entity. When you compare the models, which approach is more vampiric?” LooksRare’s trading volume has zoomed past OpenSea’s, but researchers have pointed out that most of it came from “wash trading”—that is, from accounts buying their own NFTs in order to inflate prices. Jamie Burke, the founder and CEO of London-based VC firm Outlier Ventures, says that the showdown between OpenSea and LooksRare is healthy for both the companies and the NFT industry at large. “I think having competition makes people stay innovative,” he says. “Intellectually, I'm interested in seeing how these two different models compete, seeing them duke it out and see the pros and cons.” As things stand, Burke says, “OpenSea is the standard” for NFT companies. And the work with Twitter on NFT profile pictures demonstrates that it is opening up its API to partners, which Burke sees as positive. That will still not sort out OpenSea’s unresolved oscillation between Web3 libertarianism and Web2 responsibility. The incentives, the cryptocurrency expert with knowledge of OpenSea’s operations says, are diabolically aligned: Going for a curated, sanitized model would cost OpenSea a big slice of the NFT crowd that longs for a Wild West ecosystem, but staying on the current light-touch course would bring about an endless string of PR crises. “They're going to want to keep the ‘anything goes' environment while doing just enough moderation to look like they're making a sufficient best effort,” the anonymous cryptocurrency expert says. “They want it to be ‘anything goes’ but they need to do just a little bit of work to get the heat off their backs all the time.” More From WIRED Reviews and Guides ©2024Condé Nast.

You've been too trusting about how it works and it's all centralized and stuff? MC: I signed up for Twitter, so every day I feel like I'm doing the internet wrong. LG: What if I told you that the blockchain is going to fix everything? MC: I would run in the opposite direction. LG: Well, just stick around at least for this podcast. MC: OK. LG: OK. [Gadget Lab intro theme music plays.] LG: Hey everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer on the blockchain. I'm a senior writer at WIRED. MC: My name is Michael Calore. I'm a senior editor at WIRED. LG: Which is also on the blockchain. MC: Oh no. LG: We're also joined by WIRED senior writer, Gilad Edelman, blockchain expert. Gilad Edelman: This is going to be a disaster. LG: All right. So today we're talking about the web. You may have heard of it. What you may be a little bit less familiar with is this idea of Web3 A.K.A, the next phase of the web. It's a buzzword that's been thrown around a lot by Silicon Valley lately. But what does it actually mean for how we're going to experience the web? So, Gilad, this week you talked with the person who coined the term, Web3. His name is Gavin Wood, and we've run this as a Q&A WIRED.com, which everyone should go read. But tell us, what is Web3? GE: Web3 is, as you say, it's a buzzword. It's not any one concretely defined concept. But the idea is that it's the next phase of the Web. So Web1 is go back to the '90s era. This is the static webpage. It's very decentralized. This is an important point. Typically, you would type in a URL and go to that site to engage with stuff. MC: And that would be like a server in a building somewhere? GE: Exactly. MC: And each one is different? GE: Right. And in the internet's early days, it just existed on everybody's computers. Web2, it refers to the era that we're living in now, where you have a lot of concentration of online activity in dominant platforms. So this is the era of the dynamic app layer or the dynamic web page layer on top of the internet. And so, a lot of online activity has got funneled through platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Amazon. And a bit further up Stack, you have a lot of... Or down the Stack, I can never remember the arrow there, but you also have concentration of computing, right? AWS, or other major Cloud providers. So there are all sorts of reasons that people are unhappy with the status quo. So the idea of Web3 is to bring back that early spirit of decentralization using the blockchain. LG: So does Web3 have to exist on the blockchain and have to involve cryptocurrencies? How fundamental is the blockchain to what it is? GE: That's a really good question. Because at the broadest level of abstraction, the idea here is decentralization, which is a concept. It's not a particular technology. But the energy here is really coming from the blockchain. And when people talk about Web3, they're absolutely talking about blockchain-related technologies. So Gavin Wood told me that, the thing about blockchain is that it's the only technology he's ever come across that's about distributing power rather than centralizing power. And I don't know if I totally buy that, but there are reasons to believe that that might be true in the sense that... I mean, the whole point of blockchain going back to Bitcoin is that you don't need a central authority saying what's true and what's false. Because the innovation of the blockchain that made Bitcoin such a big thing to begin with is that the ledger, the record keeping is distributed and it's happening on all of the computers that are in the network. To somebody like Gavin Wood, that's a really powerful idea, because in his view, a huge problem right now is that we have to trust central gatekeepers like monopolistic tech companies, and also like the centralized government regulators that supposedly have power over them. And so, to somebody like Gavin Wood and other people who are excited about this technology, the promise of using blockchain is that you can somehow break free of that need to put your faith in a central authority. MC: And also break free of the possibility of being regulated? It seems to me like that's part of the motivation here. Because if the argument is that the internet is broken, because all the tools that we use are part of these large platforms that are owned by big corporations, that's not necessarily true. As you pointed out in your Q&A, the internet is built on Open Source Software, and that Software talks to each other using protocols that nobody owns. So if I wanted to, I could build a server in my home and start serving my own webpages and run my own email server and run my own Mastodon server. I could do all of these things on my own right now as it exists. So why is that something that needs to be fixed? Is the move towards Web3 like all the technologists are saying, \"Oh, Web3 is the future?\" Are they actually saying, \"We need to build a new layer on top of this technology that already exists\"? Or are they calling for a return to the more pure days of the web before the platform's dominated? GE: It is. We are talking about a new layer because as you say, and as I mentioned, thanks for calling that, I thought that was pretty smart, in the Q&A, the internet as distinct from the web, is decentralized already. MC: Yeah. LG: Mm-hmm. GE: Or- MC: You can build anything decentralized on the internet now if you want. GE: Right. And as you say, Mastodon is a decentralized, open-source Twitter alternative, right? That's what Mastodon is, Twitter alternative? MC: Yes. LG: Mm-hmm. MC: Yes. It's easy to forget. GE: Yeah. Yeah. This is such a frothy mix of different ideas that there's different answers to that question. There's a lot of economic activity happening right now in the crypto space that, especially on display with wave of ICOs, initial coin offerings a couple years ago, that looked pretty clearly like regulatory arbitrage, where you were getting people to invest in something just like you were with a security or stock, but because it was something different, it was a coin. It didn't have to register with the SCC. You didn't have to follow regulations and all lot ordinary people lost their shirts. So there is that side of it. But, I think the attitude of the ideologically motivated Web3 people like a Gavin wood. And when I don't even mean ideological as a pejorative, just people who are motivated sort of by philosophical commitments. It's not wanting to get around regulation so much as having no faith in regulation. So when I look at a problem like Google stranglehold over so much of the internet and advertising markets and mobile markets and browsing and search and everything, to me that looks like a policy problem. And a lot of people treat it as a policy problem, right. And? And the FTC and the DOJ and state attorneys general are working on that problem right now. But a lot of people in the Web3 space, somewhat understandably just have no faith in the government fixing the monopoly problem. And so they turn to the appeal of technological solutions rather than policy solutions. LG: I want to bring it back to the actual experience on Web3, because you asked Gavin Wood a really good question. You asked him for a specific example of how this would work. How two app developers or creators, or even consumers would use an app that is built on Web3. How did he describe this? GE: I didn't totally pin him down on this, but I think the answer is, it wouldn't look that different in theory from apps that we interact with now. Because the main differences are going to be things that are below the surface level or the user level. But I actually had an interesting conversation yesterday with the founder of a company called Presearch. And this is a search engine that is designed to be a Google alternative. It's a very privacy focused search engine and it's incorporating a lot of Web3 principles. So for example... I mean, on a technical level, it's distributed in the sense that instead of having a bunch of servers in a warehouse running the software, it's actually users can elect to be nodes in the network. And so it is decentralizing that respect. When you put in a search query, it gets routed to nodes in the network. And to incentivize people to volunteer their computing power in that way, there's a coin associated with it, a token, a crypto token associated with it. And this is a really common feature of Web3 businesses, which parenthetically that mostly don't exist. Most Web3 businesses are business ideas or proposals and not actual businesses, but there are some that are closer to reality and Presearch is one of them. The privacy browser Brave is actually maybe the most established. But this idea of decentralization is still hypothetical. As Colin, the founder of this company, freely acknowledge when we were talking yesterday, he said, so far, Presearch still controls how its business functions, how the software works. But in theory, one day he would like to see a setup where the users and the people, the stakeholders, who hold these coins, and by the way, you also get rewarded just by doing searches, they will have some way of participating in the governance of the platform. And this is a crucial idea behind the Web3 vision. Is that you, the user, or the participant, you are somehow active in providing the service and maybe literally voting on how things happen. LG: We're going to have to take a quick break, but I did want to ask you, how does this creation of applications for Web3 create value in the goods that people are exchanging on the internet? Because we're hearing about how this is going to open things up for the creator economy who make digital goods or apps. How does that actually work? GE: Yes. That's such a good question. It depends exactly what you're talking about. So in the case of a Web3 company, like the one I was just talking about, generally, the economic value here is from the token associated with it. So for example, with Presearch, the idea is that advertisers who instead of just bidding with dollars to have their ad displayed at the top of the search results, they have to bid in this coin. But they don't actually spend the coin. They stake it. So they have to buy the coins if they want a bid in the auction. And then if they win the auction, those coins are staked, which basically means you can't use them, they're kind of locked up. And the point here is that, this is generating demand for the token, which raises the value of the token. And then on the flip side, you get rewarded in fractions of a token every time you do a search. So the idea here, which is very common when you talk to Web3 entrepreneurs, is all about in aligning the incentives so that everybody in the network or the exchange that you're talking about, is motivated by the value of the token. And the thing that I haven't figured out yet is, is this just a Ponzi scheme or multi-level marketing? And I'm not saying that it's a conscious scam. Because a lot of these entrepreneurs and founders I'm talking to are very high minded and idealistic. But at a certain point, if the value proposition here is just coming from increasing demand for this asset over time and the value of the asset doesn't have any external referent, then there's something a little bit ponzi-ish about it. I haven't really made up my mind. MC: What's holding the house up. GE: Right. LG: Right. Or is it just false scarcity. OK, I think you've hit the right note of skepticism for us to take a break and then come back and resume that part of the conversation. So stay tuned. We'll be right back. [Break] LG: So Web3 is really just one part of a bigger conversation that's happening right now. About what the future of the web will really look like. Some high profile technologists, yeah, we couldn't get through one week of the podcast without mentioning Mark Zuckerberg, are drawing out these visions right now, or introducing these new frameworks for the web, this next set of connected experiences. But I'm curious how realistic are these pie in the sky ideas and is it going to make the internet any more equal than it is right now? So Gilad, as you were talking to Gavin wood about Web3 and these other entrepreneurs who you've now been able to chat with, which elements of this vision struck you as legit, and which part seemed a little bit more like science fiction? GE: So far, my feeling is that the strong version of the pitch for Web3 is that it's going to break the stranglehold, the power of the central gatekeepers, like the Googles and the Apples and the Facebooks. And I've yet to figure out why that would be true. So, so far to me, that feels like science fiction. However, is there room for alternative businesses that maybe appeal to more technically minded audiences or user bases and can find ways to monetize through having their own tokens or coins in a none scammy way? I'm coming around to thinking that the answer to that could be, yes. I think there's something to these alternate business models, but there's more of a philosophical question, which is, will this technology really lead to more distribution of power, of wealth, of value, of creativity, or will it like just about every technological innovation in history, find a way to facilitate greater concentration and let the rich get richer and the powerful get more powerful. And the jury is still out on that. I mean, just because you're using the blockchain doesn't mean that there's nobody with more power. There's people who hold more of the coins. There's people who manage the protocols. There's people who have power off the blockchain that they can use to influence events on the blockchain. And I don't know when we're going to find out the answers to this question. I mean, you could look at it as Bitcoin only a little more than a decade old. Think about how long it took from the invention of the internet protocols, evening the invention of email, till we got to a point where people understood how you could use it and browsers existed, that was a long time. Or you could say, Bitcoin has been around as long as the... The blockchain has been around as long as the iPhone, where's our apps? MC: Yeah. And I'm going to back you up with that cynical worldview, because I do believe that like once a platform becomes valuable, then it's open for manipulation by capital and people who want to control it, right? And these new Web3 systems that we're talking about are going to become valuable when people actually start using them. So as the network grows and becomes more widespread, then it creates more value for all the users. And it creates more value for people who want to use it to make money. Advertisers, BCs, whatever. So you're talking about like building a new system with this new tech, and the technology is based on trust and transparency. And those things are not... Trust and transparency in a system, and that system being valuable are not mutually exclusive. GE: Right. But I would also say just to your point about the value coming when as a network grows, this is such a point because you have to ask yourself, what's going to make the user want to... The person want to use some Web3 alternative to existing, right? Why would I sign up for a Web3-based social network, right? Why would I use a Web3-based search engine? And as- MC: Because you believe in Web3, and you want to... You have to already be the game in order to want to play, right? GE: Yeah. I said to Colin Pape, the founder of Preearch yesterday, I don't think that people's complaint about Google is that the ledger is too mutable. LG: Right. You're complaining that now when they Google something, there are six ads that come at time of the feed. GE: And to his credit, he fully acknowledge that he said, \"Look for now, our target audience is definitely people who care about this. People who are more tech savvy. And over time, once they've built up the network, that's when the norm the more normal non-enthusiast people will come around. So there's like dot dot dot in between those two steps that I haven't quite figured out. But a great question to ask when someone's pitching you some Web3 alternative to an existing app or platform or network is, why are people going to want to use this? And maybe the answer as they would is, it's because of the tokens. It's because we're going to be paying you. The value incentives are all going to be aligned and everybody's going to want to join and build up the value of the token. And that's what's going to draw people in. Maybe that'll happen in some cases, but that's the right question to ask. MC: And it might be a situation where like we're seeing with cryptocurrency now, where you have a few crypto coins that are very valuable. And then there's like a bazillion people out there who are trying to get you to buy their coin, because they want to build the value of their coin. And it's like, which one do you buy into? Do you buy into Tiddlywink, or do you buy into Ethereum or Bitcoin, or one of the ones that holds real value in The world? GE: Totally. And if we extend that line of thinking, let's say that each of the three of us starts our own Web3 social network. And we each have this token-based business model. You could imagine the same winner take all effects that exist in Web2 you to apply to Web3, where one of our tokens is going to start to build value. That's going to be the winner. That's going to be the network everybody wants to get on. And maybe Web3 will just have the Web3 version of Facebook, the dominant social media, the dominant social network, because it might not be possible for all these different token based business models to succeed at the same time. MC: Yeah. LG: So on the one hand here at WEIRD, we tend to be cautious optimist and keeping an eye towards the future. But I'm fascinated by these relatively new attempts by technologists to codify what's been emerging for years now, right? what's in a name? blockchain's been around forever. Forever, several years at this point. Non-fungible tokens. The idea of that is not necessarily new. The metaverse. For a while, was VR and AR. And then a few years ago it became XR. And now it's the metaverse. So like on the one hand, humans often feel the need to label or name things. So maybe that's not all that unusual. And sometimes by naming or creating structure around something, we can bring them into existence. But I can't help, but be a little bit skeptical that by creating names around these technologies, it's basically part of a land grab for this next version of the web. And what it's going to lead to is just more capital because it enables companies to go to Sand Hill Road and their startups and say, \"I'm a Web3 company, I'm a metaverse company.\" And we certainly see that in our inboxes here at WIRED too, GE: Naming something is very powerful. And you're right to be skeptical. I mean, I think it's fair to say that the people who deserve the most credit or blame for popularizing the Web3 term are the venture capitalists at Andreessen Horowitz, they're crypto funds specifically. It's been reported in a lot of places that they're making a big lobbying push on Washington to make sure that regulations and laws that are passed don't imperil their crypto holdings and investments. And they're very bullish on this Web3 notion. So these are money people, right? They think that they can make money. They think there's money to be made here. But at the same time, I think that the reason that it's kind of catching on is that... And the reason that other buzzwords are kind catching on lately, like the metaverse, is that people are kind of sick of the status quo. I think that things feel a little bit stuck right now and we're we're getting tired of using the same interfaces that are actually getting worse. Shopping for stuff on it, finding what you want on Amazon has gotten harder. Finding the right results on Google has, in many ways, gotten harder because they've rolled up so much of the economy that they don't have to try as hard to be good. And so people are kind of sick of that. And the idea of something new, a new way to interact, genuinely exciting technological development is, well, it's genuinely exciting. And when you put a name on that, it helps people imagine, it ties together things that otherwise might seem disparate and gives people something to get excited about. The question is, are we going to get something genuinely cool? Or is it just the money guys who are going to get the return on investment? MC: Just the money guys. It's always just the money guys. Sorry. LG: I was just going to say something eloquent, like, \"Well, we probably can't answer that in this podcast,\" but Mike just answered it for us. So thank you, Mike. MC: You're welcome. LG: All right. Gilad, thank you so much for trying to unpack all of this complicated Web3 lingo. I think we're going to have to have you back on in the future to unpack it a little bit more. But let's take a break and then we're going to come back with recommendations. All right. Gilad, as our guest of honor and resident blockchain Web3 expert, what is your recommendation? GE: OK. I've got two recommendations this week. The first one is, sticking on the blockchain theme, the book,Digital Gold, by theNew York Timesreporter Nathaniel Popper. I recently read and it's very good. So it was published in 2015. So it's not going to bring you up to speed. No one was talking about, well, almost no one was talking about Web3 back then. But, it's a really good introduction, very detailed history of Bitcoin and by extension blockchain. And the author is a very good, clear explainer of difficult concepts. So if anybody out there doesn't really know where to begin, I do recommend that book. MC:Digital Gold? GE:Digital Gold. And then my other recommendation, when perhaps I'm stealing this from one of you guys is our producer Boone Ashworth has a fantastic feature on WIRED.com right now, The Twitter Wildfire Watcher Who Tracks California's Blazes. It's really masterfully done by our friend Boone. It's about a guy who, I don't want to give too much away, but it's about the most popular and helpful Twitter account that warns people in California, when and whether to evacuate because of wildfires. And it's run by a guy all the way in New Zealand, oddly enough. And Boone just goes into a lot of fascinating detail about this man and his story and how he got into this and the nuts and bolts of how he does it and the impact that has. So highly, highly recommend that. MC: So let me just say Gilad, you lovely bastard. You did in fact, steal my recommendation. I was going to recommend that everybody read Boone's story. Because Boone is our producer, he sits here either on Zoom or in the room with us every week and does this show. But he is also a fantastic writer, as you mentioned. And yeah, it's a lovely story. It's a feature. So it's long. And it has beautiful photographs. And it also talks about sort of the breakdown that happens when people are craving real time information and the emergency services are too busy dealing with the emergency to provide real time information and how that creates a vacuum that is filled by all of these volunteers. GE: Yeah. There's really interesting dynamics in there. But I kind of want to pump the brakes because I'm worried that we're laying it on tooth thick at this point. MC: Yes. GE: Because Boone, what are we going to do if he gets too big for this podcast? MC: I mean, he already is, but he insists on doing it. I've tried to get rid of him. GE: Ah, I See. OK. So we're trying to inflate him so that he floats away. MC: I think so. GE: OK. MC: Anyway. Yeah, big round of applause for Boone. This is your first big feature story for WIRED after working here a couple years and writing a lot of really great stories and editing a lot of really great podcasts. But this is a big one and it's great. Everybody should read it. GE: The Twitter Wildfire Watcher Who Tracks California's Blazes. Boone Ashworth: Thanks guys. MC: OK, Laura, now can you see something really mean about Boone. GE: OK. Just to balance it out. LG: So I was going to recommend this story that's on WIRED.com today. It's titled, The Twitter Wildfire Watcher Who Tracks California's Blazes. GE: Never heard of it. LG: It's by this guy named Boone Ashworth. He also happens to be our podcast producer. Am I being redundant at all? GE: Tell me more. MC: No, this is how the blockchain works. LG: This is how ... Oh, OK. MC: All three of us have to have- GE: That's very good. LG: Are we all getting paid in tokens for this. MC: Yes. LG: Boonecoin. MC: Boonecoin. LG: Boonecoin. Oh my God. That's amazing. MC: Yeah. LG: Oh, and so when people, when they ask you how much your Boonecoin is worth, they're going to say, \"How much is Ash worth?\" MC: \"How much is Ash worth?\" GE: Yes. LG: Uh-huh. Or you can just call it Ashcoin because then it's like, how much is your Ash worth? MC: How many people do you think are still listening at this point? BA: I quit. MC: OK. Really, what's your recommendation? LG: OK, my recommendation this week is going to be a borrowed recommendation from another week. Mike, you had recommendedBroad Citya while back, and you kept telling me, you need to watch it. It's not a new show. It started in 2014. It ran through 2019. I finally started watching it. It is hilarious. Now basically in the evenings, I wonder how is too late to text Mike and say, just an FYI, I'm crying laughing right now, watching Broad City. It's so deeply weird and funny. And the two women who write the show and star in the show are so talented and I'm loving it. MC: Well, never too late to text me. I just reserve the right to wait until 6:00 am when I wake up to respond. LG: OK. Yeah. Pretty much. My signal last night to Mike was I wasn't that late, but I was like, oh my God, I'm at the seafood episode. Oh, it's so good. GE: And are you, are you more of an Abbi person or an Ilana person? LG: This is an important question. I feel like, oh God, I don't know. So I lived in New York in my 20s and I'm trying to think of like, for a long time, pretty much the whole decade. And I'm trying to think of who I was probably more like, and I was probably a little bit more of an Abbi. Yeah. MC: Obviously. GE: Yas, queen. LG: Yes. I too worked at a gym and aspire to be a spin instructor. No, I didn't really, but I don't know, it'd be fun to be a spin instructor. MC: Oh my God. GE: That's not the message of the show. LG: No, I know. It's not at all. No, strike that. OK. MC: It's also very rewatchable. LG: You mean it seems that way. MC: When you get to the end, you wait a year and then go back and re-watch it. LG: Also, it's like many shows, a nice snapshot of our lives, pre-pandemic. MC: Yeah. LG: They're on the subway or they're in clubs or doing whatever they're doing. And I'm like, \"Oh, they end up in the hospital together one night, the seafood episode.\" And, and I'm like, \"Oh, they're no masks. Everyone's just all crowded and on top of each other.\" GE: To be fair, most television shows are like that. MC: Yeah. LG: I know. I know. MC: Yep. LG: All right. I think we're going to end it. And by the way, did I mention our producer Boone wrote a great story this week on WIRED.com? GE: What's it about? LG: It's about wildfires MC: And the people who tweet about them LG: And the people who tweet about them. And one man in particular, who lives in New Zealand. You guys should really all go read. GE: This does not ring a bell. LG: OK. I'll send it to you. GE: Cool. LG: Via Slack. GE: Put it on the blockchain, please. LG: All right. That's our show. Gilad- GE: Bye. LG: Thank you. Bye. Thank you for joining us. GE: My pleasure. LG: Thank you, Mike as always, for being a great, co-host. MC: Just, same to you. LG: And thanks for recommending Broad City a while ago. MC: You're welcome. LG: So I could recommend it again. MC: Glad you like it. LG: All right. Thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter, just check the show notes. Also, you can leave us a review in Apple Podcast. I love reading this. This show is produced by this guy named Boone Ashworth, who also wrote a story on wire.com this week. GE: Oh my God. Did he? LG: He did. Goodbye. BA: You guys are lunatics.

    "news_title": "Meta’s Next Llama AI Models Are Training on a GPU Cluster ‘Bigger Than Anything’ Else | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid down the newest marker in generative AI training on Wednesday, saying that the next major release of thecompany’s Llama modelis being trained on a cluster of GPUs that’s “bigger than anything” else that’s been reported. Llama 4 development is well underway, Zuckerberg told investors and analysts on an earnings call, with an initial launch expected early next year. “We're training the Llama 4 models on a cluster that is bigger than 100,000 H100s, or bigger than anything that I've seen reported for what others are doing,” Zuckerberg said, referring to theNvidia chips popular for training AI systems. “I expect that the smaller Llama 4 models will be ready first.” Increasing the scale of AI training with more computing power and data is widely believed to be key to developing significantly more capable AI models. While Meta appears to have the lead now, most of the big players in the field are likely working toward using compute clusters with more than 100,000 advanced chips. In March, Meta and Nvidiashared details about clustersof about 25,000 H100s that were used to developLlama 3. In July, Elon Musktoutedhis xAI venture having worked with X and Nvidia to set up 100,000 H100s. “It’s the most powerful AI training cluster in the world!” Musk wrote on X at the time. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg declined to offer details on Llama 4’s potential advanced capabilities but vaguely referred to “newmodalities,”“stronger reasoning,”and “much faster.” Meta’s approach to AI is proving a wild card in the corporate race for dominance. Llama models can be downloaded in their entirety for free in contrast to the models developed by OpenAI, Google, and most other major companies, which can be accessed only through an API. Llama has proven hugely popular with startups and researchers looking to have complete control over their models, data, and compute costs. Although touted as “open source” by Meta, the Llama license does impose some restrictions on the model’s commercial use. Meta also does not disclose details of the models’ training, which limits outsiders’ ability to probe how it works. The companyreleased the first version of Llamain July of 2023 and made the latest version, Llama 3.2,available this September. Managing such a gargantuan array of chips to develop Llama 4 is likely to present unique engineering challenges and require vast amounts of energy. Meta executives on Wednesday sidestepped an analyst question aboutenergy access constraintsin parts of the US that have hampered companies’ efforts to develop more powerful AI. According toone estimate, a cluster of 100,000 H100 chips would require 150 megawatts of power. The largest national lab supercomputer in the United States,El Capitan, by contrast requires 30 megawatts of power. Meta expects to spend as much as $40 billion in capital this year to furnish data centers and other infrastructure, an increase of more than 42 percent from 2023. The company expects even more torrid growth in that spending next year. Meta’s total operating costs have grown about 9 percent this year. But overall sales—largely from ads—have surged more than 22 percent, leaving the company with fatter margins and larger profits even as it pours billions of dollars into the Llama efforts. Meanwhile, OpenAI, considered the current leader in developing cutting-edge AI, is burning through cash despite charging developers for access to its models. Whatfor now remains a nonprofit venturehas said that it is training GPT-5, a successor to the model that currently powers ChatGPT. OpenAI has said that GPT-5 will be larger than its predecessor, but it has not said anything about the computer cluster it is using for training. OpenAI has also said that in addition to scale, GPT-5 will incorporate other innovations, including a recently developedapproach to reasoning. CEO Sam Altmanhas saidthat GPT-5 will be “a significant leap forward” compared to its predecessor. Last week, Altman responded to a news report stating that OpenAI’s next frontier model would be released by Decemberby writingon X, “fakes news out of control.” On Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company’s newest version of theGemini family of generative AI modelsis in development. Meta’s open approach to AI has at times proven controversial. Some AI experts worry that making significantly more powerful AI models freely available could be dangerous because it could help criminals launch cyberattacks or automate the design of chemical or biological weapons. Although Llama is fine-tuned prior to its release to restrict misbehavior, it is relatively trivial to remove these restrictions. Zuckerberg remains bullish about the open source strategy, even as Google and OpenAI push proprietary systems. “It seems pretty clear to me that open source will be the most cost effective, customizable, trustworthy, performant, and easiest to use option that is available to developers,” he said on Wednesday. “And I am proud that Llama is leading the way on this.” Zuckerberg added that the new capabilities of Llama 4 should be able to powera wider range of features across Meta services. Today, the signature offering based on Llama models is the ChatGPT-like chatbot known as Meta AI that’s available in Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other apps. Over 500 million people monthly use Meta AI, Zuckerberg said. Over time, Meta expects to generate revenue through ads in the feature. “There will be a broadening set of queries that people use it for, and the monetization opportunities will exist over time as we get there,” Meta CFO Susan Li said on Wednesday’s call. With the potential for revenue from ads, Meta just might be able to pull off subsidizing Llama for everyone else.

    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. “I was in shock and disbelief,” says a paid door knocker flown toMichiganto help turn out the vote for formerpresident Donald Trumpon behalf ofElon Musk’s America PAC. In Michigan, canvassers and paid door knockers for the former president, contracted by a firm associated with America PAC, have been subjected to poor working conditions: A number of them have been driven around in the back of a seatless U-Haul van, according to video obtained by WIRED, and threatened that their lodging at a local motel wouldn’t be paid for if they didn’t meet canvassing quotas. One door knocker alleges that they didn’t even know they were signing up for anything having to do with Musk or Trump. A representative for Musk and America PAC did not return a request for comment. The contract these door knockers signed with Blitz Canvassing, which is a subcontractor of Musk’s America PAC, says they are “expected to maintain a 17-22% engagement rate during the campaign,” which is a high target relative to the number of people who typically open their door for a stranger. A group of out-of-state America PAC canvassers were told during a recent team meeting that if they didn’t hit their targets, which the door knocker says were more than 1,000 a week on total doors knocked, the organization would stop paying for their motel rooms. “What’s gonna happen is, they’re gonna stop paying for these rooms,” a manager told the door knockers in an audio recording obtained by WIRED. “And then you’re gonna end up having to pay for it yourself. You can’t do that with no money.” The door knocker also alleges that they were told that they will have to pay for their own flight home. Blitz Canvassing, which hadreceived more than $9 million from America PACfor presidential campaign canvassing as of October 29, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. America PAC canvassers in Michigan being driven around in the back of a U-Haul van. (Photo obtained by WIRED) One of the canvassers, who was flown in from outside the Midwest, tells WIRED they had no idea they would be knocking on doors in support of Trump or that the subcontractor they were working for was part of Elon Musk’s voter-turnout operation through America PAC. “I knew nothing of the job, or much of the job description, other than going door to door and asking the voters who are they voting for,” says a door knocker who was one of the people in the back of the van and who is requesting anonymity because they signed a nondisclosure agreement. “Then, after I signed over an NDA, is when I found out we are for Republicans and with Trump.” The door knocker adds that they had “overheard my supervisor and a few others mention Elon Musk” by name, marking the first time they had heard of the billionaire X owner’s involvement. The Trump campaign has largely outsourced its field operation in Michigan to Musk, a move that has come under heavy criticism as previously reported byWIRED. Blitz Canvassing has also reportedly had issues with fake door knocks being flagged by Campaign Sidekick, the glitchy app used by America PAC. In Nevada and Arizona,up to a quarter of the door interactions were flagged as potential fakeswithin the app, according to The Guardian. (“Sidekick was never expected to handle the auditing of America PAC’s door operation. The reason the PAC is confident in its numbers is because of the auditing procedures each canvassing firm puts in place and the auditing procedures of the PAC writ large,” a person familiar with the America PAC operation told The Guardian at the time.) Field organizing normally does not work this way. Thegold standard for door knocking appsis MiniVAN, and transportation usually involves carpooling with other volunteers or campaign staff offering a ride—preferably, with seat belts. Initially, the paid door knockers for the Blitz subcontractor didn’t have transportation to get around Michigan, since no one in the group had a valid driver’s license. On Saturday, October 19, supervisors for the canvassers initially commandeered some Ubers for them to reach their list of addresses. But by Sunday, the door knockers were loaded into a rented U-Haul moving van with no rear seating or seatbelts, in a photo and videos viewed by WIRED. “We were all told our transportation would be handled and we’d be in rental cars. It turned out to be U-Haul vans, and I felt embarrassed and played,” the door knocker tells WIRED. The video from inside the van shows a bumpy ride, with a cage separating the mostly Black door knockers from their driver. The driver also told the group of door knockers that he was in pain and had difficulty driving: “I just had surgery, bro,” the U-Haul driver says in another recording obtained by WIRED. “Like half of my foot is cut off.” “I’m scared,” the door knocker who spoke to WIRED replies on the recording. “And all [the manager] is concerned about is how many motherfuckin’ doors the bitch got,” the driver responds. The canvassers were then dropped off roughly 40 minutes apart from each other, relying on the mobile app to log their interactions at front doors. In a contract agreement reviewed by WIRED, door knockers were given specific “performance guidelines” along with a mandate to “keep the GPS function of their personal device turned on during all working hours.” Each knock at the door must be done in 15 seconds or less, and the contractors “must remain on a property for at least 30 seconds.” The Campaign Sidekick app used by America PAC has severe limitations in its functionality, including the lack of a geo-tracking feature—hence the requirement that canvassers leave GPS services on for their personal devices at all times, according to a contract reviewed by WIRED—forcing them to use “offline walkbooks,” a function of the America PAC app, that don’t offer the support of GPS or real-time upload capabilities. While this particular group of door knockers was being managed through Blitz Canvassing, screenshots shared with WIRED show America PAC listed in the mobile app they were using to knock on doors. “Recommended attire includes a red polo shirt with khaki pants or jeans, and closed-toed shoes,” the “attire” section of the contract reads. “Clothing with graffiti, writing, or ripped jeans/shorts is not allowed.” In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-tested gear Abitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Story:An oral history ofWIRED’s original website I madea wholesome OnlyFansto try to make ends meet Event:Join us forWIRED Healthon March 18 in London More From WIRED Reviews and Guides ©2024Condé Nast.

    "news_title": "Elon Musk’s Criticism of ‘Woke AI’ Suggests ChatGPT Could Be a Trump Administration Target | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Elon Muskjust draggedChatGPTand otherartificial intelligence programsinto the Trump crosshairs by repeating his warning that current AI models are too “woke” and “politically correct.” “A lot of the AIs that are being trained in the San Francisco Bay Area, they take on the philosophy of people around them,” Musk said at theFuture Investment Initiative, a Saudi Arabia government–backed event held in Riyadh this week. “So you have a woke, nihilistic—in my opinion—philosophy that is being built into these AIs.” Although Musk is himself a polarizing figure, he is right about AI systems harboring political biases. The issue, however, is far from one-sided, and Musk’s framing may help further his own interests due to histies to Trump. Musk runsxAI, a competitor to OpenAI, Google, and Meta that could benefit if those companies become government targets. “Musk clearly has a close, close relationship with the Trump campaign, and any comment that he’s making will hold a big influence,” saysMatt Mittelsteadt, a research fellow at George Mason University. “At a maximum he could have some sort of seat in a potential Trump administration, and his views could actually be enacted into some sort of policy.” Musk has previously accusedboth OpenAIand Googleof being infected with “the woke mind virus.” When Google’s Gemini chatbot produced historically inaccurate images, includingblack Nazis and Vikings, in February, Musk saw it asproof of Google using AI to spread an absurdly wokeoutlook. Musk is clearly no fan of government regulation, but he backed a proposed AI bill in California that would have required companies to make their AI models available for vetting. The first Trump administration also targeted perceived bias at Big Tech companies with an executive order thatsought to hold platforms such as Twitter, Google, and Facebook accountablefor censoring information for political reasons. Thepressure had a tangible impact, with Meta ultimatelyabandoning plansfor a dedicated news section on Facebook. Mittelsteadt notes that Trump’s VP pick, JD Vance, has also talked of reining in Big Tech companies and gone as far as to call Google “one of the most dangerous companies in the world.” Mittelsteadt adds that Trump could punish companies in a variety of ways. He cites, for example, the way the Trump government canceled a major federal contract with Amazon Web Services, a decision likely influenced by the former president’s view of the Washington Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos. It would not be hard for policymakers to point to evidence of political bias in AI models, even if it cuts both ways. A2023 studyby researchers at the University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon University, and Xi’an Jiaotong University found a range of political leanings in different large language models. It also showed how this bias may affect the performance of hate speech or misinformation detection systems. Another study, conducted by researchers at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, found bias in several open source AI models on polarizing issues such as immigration, reproductive rights, and climate change. Yejin Bang, a PhD candidate involved with the work, says that most models tend to lean liberal and US-centric, but that the same models can express a variety of liberal or conservative biases depending on the topic. AI models capture political biases because they are trained on swaths of internet data that inevitably includes all sorts of perspectives. Most users may not be aware of any bias in the tools they use because models incorporate guardrails that restrict them from generating certain harmful or biased content. These biases can leak out subtly though, and the additional training that models receive to restrict their output can introduce further partisanship. “Developers could ensure that models are exposed to multiple perspectives on divisive topics, allowing them to respond with a balanced viewpoint,” Bang says. The issue may become worse as AI systems become more pervasive, saysAshique KhudaBukhsh, an computer scientist at the Rochester Institute of Technology who developed a tool called the Toxicity Rabbit Hole Framework, which teases out the different societal biases of large language models. “We fear that a vicious cycle is about to start as new generations of LLMs will increasingly be trained on data contaminated by AI-generated content,” he says. “I’m convinced that that bias within LLMs is already an issue and will most likely be an even bigger one in the future,” says Luca Rettenberger, a postdoctoral researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology who conducted an analysis of LLMs for biases related to German politics. Rettenberger suggests that political groups may also seek to influence LLMs in order to promote their own views above those of others. “If someone is very ambitious and has malicious intentions it could be possible to manipulate LLMs into certain directions,” he says. “I see the manipulation of training data as a real danger.” There have already been some efforts to shift the balance of bias in AI models. Last March, oneprogrammer developed a more right-leaning chatbotin an effort to highlight the subtle biases he saw in tools like ChatGPT. Musk has himself promised to make Grok, the AI chatbot built by xAI, “maximally truth-seeking” and less biased than other AI tools, although in practiceit also hedgeswhen it comes to tricky political questions. (A staunch Trump supporter and immigration hawk, Musk’s own view of “less biased” may also translate into more right-leaning results.) Next week’s election in the United States is hardly likely to heal the discord between Democrats and Republicans, but if Trump wins, talk of anti-woke AI could get a lot louder. Musk offered an apocalyptic take on the issue at this week’s event, referring to an incident when Google’s Gemini said that nuclear war would be preferable to misgendering Caitlyn Jenner. “If you have an AI that’s programmed for things like that, it could conclude that the best way to ensure nobody is misgendered is to annihilate all humans, thus making the probability of a future misgendering zero,” he said.

    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Whether you viewWeb3—the decentralized vision of the future of the internet—as a utopian idea or a Ponzi scheme, one thing is for certain: It’s meant to look different from what’s gone before. This is what makes the latest moves by Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, and Twitter so strange. On January 20, Twitter rolled out the ability for users of itspaid premium service, Twitter Blue, tochange their profile pictureto a non-fungible token (NFT) they own—a key part ofWeb3. On the same day,The Financial Timesreportedthat Meta was working on integrating NFT ownership into their profiles on Facebook and Instagram. The company is also developing a tool to allow users to mint NFTs of their own on Meta platforms, according to reports. It follows public statements in December 2021 from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri that his app was exploring the promise of NFTs. The co-opting of NFTs by big tech platforms is, in some way, unsurprising. Web3 and NFTs have become hot commodities—the biggest player in the space, NFT marketplace OpenSea,raised $300 million in fundingearlier this month, giving it a valuation of $13.3 billion. It makes sense that the biggest names on Web 2.0 would want to capitalize on the trend and stay relevant. Unfortunately, Meta and Twitter’s plan to sanitize NFTs goes directly against the principle by which they were created. Both companies favor key practices that Web3 supporters want to do away with—centralized control of key digital services by a handful of multibillion-dollar corporations. Both make inordinate amounts of money from the things that Web3’s biggest boosters want to remove. And for the Silicon Valley titans, the backing of a market full of scammers and fraudsters is an odd move. “At the moment it’s the wild west—there’s nobody to police this,” says Alan Woodward, professor of cybersecurity at the University of Surrey. “The problem is these social media companies become responsible. They become policemen.” That’s particularly worrisome given the sheer volume of copyright and ownership disputes that have blighted NFT artwork in recent months. “If there’s a dispute over those NFTs, who do those people go to?” asks Woodward. “It’ll be Facebook or Twitter. Why would you want to take that liability?” Already buffeted byregulators who want to curb their power, Twitter and Meta are among the internet companies caught in the middle of apolarized political debateover whether they are responsible for the propagation of violent and extreme content online, so giving any ammunition to their critics seems foolhardy. And yet they’re about to share the imprimatur of their implicit support to a technology that is famous fora rug pull that stole millions of dollars from victims,racism(lots of racism), andtheft, as well as questionable ties to shady Russian crime gangs who are happy tofictionalize their nationality and genderto take money from rubes. Both Twitter and Facebook did not respond to a request for comment for this story. “Despite the positivity around NFT use cases, there’s a lot of distrust in the community—perhaps due to the anonymity of key artists and influencers, and almost certainly due to the scammers that circle like vultures and frequent rug pulls,” says PJ Cooper, founder of Pandimensional Trading Co., which is launching its own NFT collection later this year. Despite those reservations, Cooper is largely supportive of Twitter’s entry into the NFT space, and says he will display an NFT as his profile picture when functionality rolls out to the UK. Cooper does, however, have worries about the fact that people can still right-click and save NFT profile pictures and mint their own version of them as NFTs. A company spokesperson for NFT marketplace OpenSea, Allie Mack, confirmed that NFT profile pictures that appear on Twitter are verified through the company’s site. In fact, Twitter uses API, metadata, and collection information from OpenSea to authenticate an NFT displayed on a user’s profile and turns it into a “soft hexagon” on the site. Around the same time as Twitter launched NFTs,OpenSea crashed. At the time,security researcher Jane Manchun Wongtweeted that OpenSea’s platform had taken out Twitter’s NFT feature. OpenSea says that the outage had“absolutely zero impact on the public Twitter integration” and that the issue flagged by Jane happened in a closed beta. Since the Twitter integration launch, Mack says there has been zero interruption to the Twitter service. Others are not convinced that relying on a third party site is the right decision. “OpenSea is pretty unreliable,” says Patrick McCorry, senior system engineer at blockchain startup Infura. This may be one thing Big Tech wants to fix before embracing NFTs full bore, he says. The OpenSea platform itself has not been free of controversy. Artists have pointed out that the site is rife with rip-off NFT versions of their real-life art, or versions of their sculptures and paintings that could easily be purchased by unwitting social media users. The problem got so big that DeviantArt, an art hosting website from which works were repeatedly lifted,developed its own toolto scan the blockchain for works that also appear on its site, and inform the creators. The platform does haveprocedures for those whose art has been stolento appeal for work to be taken down, but the problem persists. Arecent investigationfound profiles selling NFTs of trademarked logos from some of the world’s biggest brands, including Microsoft, Disney, Amazon, and Adidas, without permission. Theft is a perennial problem for the NFT world, and one that seems unlikely to be easily fixed, but McCorry thinks that’s a non-issue for Meta and Twitter. “What matters really is custody and the ability to sell it on a secondary market,” he says. For now, it is clear that neither company would own or have custody of an NFT. “Custody is a liability for them,” he said. For those deep in the NFT space, the adoption of official standards by Twitter in particular is welcomed. Plenty of Twitter users have NFT art as their profile picture, but find it difficult to prove ownership, particularly when faced by trolls who like nothing more than to right-click and steal their NFTs to show them the fallibility of their investments. “Right now, anyone can just put up a CryptoPunk picture and pretend to have one,” says McCorry. Twitter’s plans to prove ownership officially are “a nice way to demonstrate digital property rights.” It’s easy to see why Twitter and Meta want to get involved in the NFT space—Woodward says it’s a land grab that, in the case of Meta, gives it ownership of one of the key technologies that could be involved in constructing its own version of the metaverse. For Twitter, it’s a way to build credibility around a forward-thinking tech community. “But there’s a point when the rubber hits the road, and there could be real commercial disputes about it,” says Woodward. The legitimacy that Big Tech lends the NFT experiment is a major benefit for boosters of the technology. But it could also be the thing that signals the beginning of the end for it in the long run. “One of the things about NFTs is that you and I can agree to exchange wherever we like,” says Woodward. “But if you get a corporate involved, isn’t it all becoming a bit Big Tech and commercial?” Behind this decision is an assumption that users on all three social media sites want to be involved in buying, selling, and displaying NFTs. But none have provided evidence to back up this assumption. Once the functions on these sites are rolled out, this will be the first time that the general public will be exposed and encouraged to join a digital token market that, until now, may have been perceived as obscure and niche. Zoomers on Facebook could suddenly join the once-nerdy ranks of OpenSea users and bid real money to buy digitally minted pictures of a monkey, or whatever else takes their fancy. And they may not want to at all. Woodward cautions overexuberant members of the NFT community from being too jubilant. “I don’t think anyone fully understands what the true potential or implications of NFTs are,” he says. “But I think there’s a bundle of bollocks being talked about it. I’m not sure people have got their thinking all aligned on this yet. I suspect it’s very much a case of the big tech companies wanting to jump on the bandwagon—because it is a fairly fast-moving bandwagon.” What might the big social media giants do when they’re in charge of the bandwagon? Woodward has one theory. “I think it’s just another way of acquiring and keeping users.” More From WIRED Reviews and Guides ©2024Condé Nast.

The right lighting creates mystery and tension in scary movies, and it can do the same for your Halloween decor. With a well-placed flashlight or spotlight, a simple card cutout can become a shadowy, outsize silhouette. You can also place lights at the base of your best decorations to enhance the creepy factor. If you havesmart light bulbs, you can dim them and introduce different colors. But you should also check your app. Anyone withsmart lightingcan likely find some Halloween options. Here's how to set Halloween lighting effects for a couple of our favorite smart light manufacturers: If you haveGovee smart lights, you can find a special Halloween animation by selecting your light or group of lights in the app and choosingSceneto look under theFestivaltab. Folks withPhilips Hue lightscan select lights or groups of lights, tap the plus icon at the top right next toMy Scenesand chooseHue scene galleryto find a large Halloween section packed with spooky lighting effects. If you wanttrulyspooky lighting effects, I recommend springing for the HueDynamic app (AndroidoriOS). The app offers animated scenes that emulate events like stormy lightning and candlelight. The Halloween options are great and include spooky atmospheres, undead pulsing, and even a passing ghost effect. For string lights and regular lamps inside pumpkins or decorations, usesmart plugsto schedule your display, or have lights turn on or off in response to triggers. Consider setting up amotion sensoror creating a trigger from another device, like your smart doorbell or security camera, to kick off your chosen lighting effect. But if you want to give visitors arealjump scare, you must add sound. If you’re looking for the perfecthorror sound effectsor aplaylist of Halloween-themed songs, then you will find loads of suitably scary options on Spotify or YouTube. Strategically hiddenBluetooth speakersinside decorations, or even pumpkins, can add a lot of atmosphere. All thebest smart speakerscan help you frighten guests or create the haunting ambiance you're after. If you have Alexa speakers, simply say “Alexa, let's get spooky,” and it will run through different options. There are many Halloween-related skills, such asSpooky Halloween Sounds,Scary Monster, andSpine Chilling Halloween Sounds. Say “Hey Google, get spooky” and you’ll get some sound effects and spooky music on any Google speakers or smart displays you have. You can also ask Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri for costume ideas or to tell you a scary story. Ring, Nest, and some othersmart doorbellsoffer Halloween sounds and chimes that can replace your regular ringtone. Take a look at your app and see if you have seasonal options. Here's how to set Halloween doorbell chimes for a couple of the main doorbell makers: In the Ring app, choose your device and tapAudio SettingsandChime Tonesto find Halloween chimes likeDracula ThemeandCreepy Laugh. If you're out trick-or-treating, you can also tap theSmart Responsestile to toggleQuick Replieson. TapEnable Featureon the next screen andQuick Reply Messageand choose something likeGhostly Greetings. For Nest doorbells, open theGoogle Homeapp, choose your doorbell and tap the three vertical dots at the top right to findSettings, thenDoorbellandDoorbell Themeto selectHalloween. For best results, create a trigger that sets off lighting and sound effects when someone approaches. You canuse IFTTTto link devices together and create a terrifying sequence. When someone presses the doorbell, for example, you could turn off all your front lights for a second, have them come back on in red, and then play a blood-curdling scream. Serious Halloween fans looking to take things to the next level should check outdigital decorations. Atmos FX sells MP4 files that you can play on a monitor or stick on a USB drive to play on your TV, but they work best withprojectors. You can play ghostly apparitions, shambling zombies, and many more things that go bump in the night. You just need a white projection screen you can set up in your window (although a cheap white shower curtain works well too). Many come with or without backgrounds and in a horizontal or vertical format to suit your setup. Thetalking jack-o'-lanternsare great for younger kids and can even be projected onto real pumpkins. To scare older kids and adults, try theNight Stalkers collection. The animations are top quality, with sound effects and music included. Set this up in your front window, with afog machineunderneath, and you are sure to attract a horde of trick-or-treaters.

WIRED’s Reviews team is a group of 13 full-time staff writers and editors with centuries of combined experience who conduct comprehensive testing on products, services, and software to write in-depth reviews and buying guides. The team was founded in 2017 and one of its original members,Adrienne So, is still on staff as a senior editor. We also work with a small group of trusted freelance contributors who are experts in their field. You’ll find an author bio that outlines each tester’s expertise on any review we publish. Our mission is to provide the most authentic and engaging buying advice for every product our audience needs or wants, to pioneer product discovery for tech enthusiasts, and to serve as a trusted hub for fair and thoughtful product reviews. How does WIRED select products to test and review? We’re looking to write about products our readers are interested in, which means everything from groundbreaking new tech to novel gadgets they’ve seen all over social media, to products like bed-in-a-box mattresses where it’s difficult for any individual consumer to do proper comparison shopping. Our audience is tech-savvy, so you’ll see lots of coverage of mobile phones, laptops, gaming devices, and the like, but WIRED readers also like to live comfortably and healthfully, score great deals, and often enjoy outdoor recreation. Why should I trust WIRED’s product reviews? Because we tell the truth and we do the work. WIRED’s Reviews team tests every product and service we write about, even when we’re picking the best Amazon Prime Day deals. Our product recommendations are made in service to readers and independently of revenue considerations. While we do get a small cut of most sales when readers click to buy recommended products discussed in our product reviews and buying guides, the content in those guides is created through a rigorous and independent editorial process and is subjected to the same high standards as everything else WIRED publishes. Content from our Reviews team is fact-checked by editors and goes through the same prepublication review process as any other WIRED story. When we make a mistake, we immediately correct it and append an editor’s note for transparency as appropriate. Does the WIRED Reviews team use generative AI? No. We follow the same editorial standards as everything else published by WIRED. You can read our whole policyhere, but the gist is that we do not publish stories with text generated by AI, except when AI-generated text is the point of the story. Do you purchase every product you test? No, but we do not accept “free products” from manufacturers or make any agreements that involve a promise of editorial coverage in exchange for sending us a product. We often accept delivery of review samples directly from PR agencies and brands, which we typically don't pay for. We return or donate these samples after testing. When we know a specific product is of interest to readers and a review sample is not available, WIRED will purchase the product and the writer will donate it after testing. How we test each product depends on what it is. We thoroughly test anything we recommend to readers and try to explain our methodology in each article without bogging it down with excessive detail many readers don’t care about. Our overall goal in all testing is to replicate the product’s regular use as closely as we can—this is why we review mattresses by sleeping on them in our homes rather than dropping a bowling ball on them in a lab where we conduct “nap tests.” Since our testing methodology is a popular question with both readers and brands, we’ve compiled the basic protocols for some of our key coverage areas below. Ebikes:WIRED reviews upward of 50 new ebikes a year by riding them on a variety of terrain for at least 40 miles over the course of at least two weeks. We test cargo bikes by hauling kids and groceries, we ride mountain and gravel bikes on trails, and we test commuter bikes while running errands on regular city streets (including up and down steep hills). In addition to our real-life testing, we evaluate specs like weight, tire size, battery life, motor power, and the sourcing of key components to make our guides to theBest EbikesandBest Cheap Ebikes. Electric scooters:WIRED reviewers ride electric scooters for at least 30 miles, though often much longer, on varying terrain and under various power loads (such as laden with groceries or up and down steep hills). Our main tester, the author of our guide to theBest Electric Scooters, is Brooklyn-basedJulian Chokkattu, who takes electric scooters on the same routes through Bushwick during his tests so he can evaluate how a scooter may deviate from the established baseline. Fitness trackers: WIRED’s lead testerwears fitness trackersfor at least two weeks and evaluates them on fit, specifications, durability, battery life, whether she can see the display in natural daylight, and whether features perform as advertised—for example, AI coaching, climbing software, or GPS tracking. She also evaluates companion smartphone apps based on ease of use and claimed features. Mattresses:We sleep on anymattress we recommendfor at least a week in our own homes, though we sometimes give up on a mattress after a few nights (we then tell readers to avoid it), and we will sometimes spend months long-term testing. Lead reviewerMartin Cizmarhas established a level of real-life mattress testing that’s unmatched among our competitors, who frequently do a \"nap test\" where they form an opinion after sitting around on a mattress in their office. Office chairs: We sit onevery chair we testfor several weeks while working—two weeks at the minimum, but often much longer than that. We also invite different friends and family members to try the chairs out so we can assess comfort levels for folks with different heights and body types. Mobile phones:To compile ourexpansive library of smartphone reviews and guides, our testers use any smartphone they’re reviewing for at least a week, but sometimes longer. We test each phone by loading in our own SIM cards and using the phone as we would any personal device for the duration of the testing period. To compare cameras, we take the same photos on a second, similarly priced phone at the same time and study the results. Forphone cases, which we test for at least a few days each, we look for alignment between ports and holes, check all buttons for clickiness, judge how it feels in our pockets, and check for how much the case is raised over the screen and camera lenses. We don't do drop tests as we don’t have enough free phones to replace all the broken ones. Internet routers: WIRED testsWi-Fiandmesh routersfor at least one week, though often longer, in a home setting. We test the stated features and introduce stress testing, such as cutting the power to see how routers cope with a sudden loss of power. Our lead tester,Simon Hill, also runs a bevy of technical tests, including network throughput testing, file transfers, coverage heatmaps, and speed tests—all organized into a handy (and impressive) spreadsheet. Air Purifiers: WIRED reviews more than 50 new air purifiers a year, assessing them in various home environments from coast to coast for months at a time. We test air purifiers in both homes and 100-year-old apartments with cats, dogs, and gas stoves, and near highways and in urban areas. In addition to our real-world testing, we measure decibel levels, ease of use, and efficacy, and we evaluate cost, design, length of warranty, and most importantly, the rate of air exchange in a specific-size room, making ourdeep dives,reviews, andBest Air Purifier guideessential reading. Soundbars:WIRED’s staffers, includingParker HallandRyan Waniata, evaluatesoundbarsusing a wide variety of testing material, from custom-made Dolby Atmos demos to familiar movies likeGuardians of the Galaxy, sitcoms likeSeinfeldandParks and Recreation, and everything in between. We test apps and features like auto-calibration, surround sound speakers, and multiroom audio integration in multiple settings wherever possible. For music testing, we stream carefully curated playlists and random radio stations at compressed and lossless resolutions over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi where available. We live with these products over multiple days at minimum to test their usability the same way we expect you to use them. Headphones and earbuds:Headphonesandearbudscome in a multitude of styles, sizes, and varieties and we test them in accordance. For all headphones we test, sound quality, comfort, and fit are of the utmost importance. For wireless headphones and earbuds, we pay special attention to key aspects like ease of pairing and setup, battery life, app connection and settings, and convenience features like speak-to-chat. When focusing on sound quality, we use curated playlists with familiar music (from Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain” to The Weeknd’s “Starboy”) in both compressed and lossless resolution where applicable. For spatial audio, we test music and videos in multiple formats, including Dolby Atmos. Televisions:TVsare among the most important products in A/V, and we test them accordingly. We spend at least a week with each TV we test, using it day and night as our daily driver. We utilize carefully selected video and audio content (fromHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallowson Blu-ray toOur Planetin Dolby Vision and Atmos on Netflix). Our testing material runs the gamut, including live broadcasts, streaming content, and physical media with high-end Ultra HD Blu-ray players. We use Spears & Munsil’s latest Ultra HD Benchmark discs to lock in settings and evaluate multiple resolution and HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HDR10+. We watch content in various light conditions and test usability features, from smart assistants to services like AirPlay 2 and Chromecast to paint a holistic picture. Running gear:Our lead writer runs four to five times a week, around 20 to 25 miles per week, and evaluates thegear’s overall performancewith a mix of long runs, interval runs, and trail and road running. Pizza ovens:To name thebest pizza ovens, we test each oven in our backyard for a minimum of two weeks. While using the oven, our testers also use handheld infrared thermometers to take the temperature of the baking stone at various places to gauge how evenly they heat and cook. We test all ovens with homemade dough, store-bought dough, and frozen pizzas. Luggage and backpacks: WIRED testsluggagedesigned primarily for air travel by taking it on at least two flights. When reviewingbackpacks, our testers wear them for at least two weeks. In addition to this regular use, we also evaluate design details, like whether they have straight or curved zippers, what gauge the zippers are, whether they're toothed or coiled, what the warranty is, whether the hardware is metal or plastic, or whether the fabric is sustainable. Our reviewers also do things like fill backpacks full of books and toss them around, and kick carry-on bags to see whether they get foot marks or are easy to clean. Umbrellas:Our testers use umbrellas several times, whenever it rains. We test them as a normal person would while checking for the main hallmarks of what makes a good umbrella, as listed in ourbuying guide. We also aim to get a good sense of how each umbrella handles gusts and heavy storms. Webcams: We useevery webcam we testfor several weeks as a daily driver, and our testers also try to compare the image quality with another similar model. Reviewers make audio recordings to see how the mics pick up their voices. Webcam testers often solicit feedback on appearance and sound quality during our weekly Gear team meetings, which take place over Zoom. Bidets: For our guide to theBest Bidets, our testers install the bidets on a toilet in their homes and use each sample for at least a week. Monitors: Reviewer Nena Farrell leads our coverage of thebest computer monitorsand tests each pick for at least one week, with a minimum of three working days. She sets monitors up with both a PC and Mac laptop to check performance, and she runs at least two different video games to see how the monitor performs, even if it isn't a monitor designed specifically for video games. Camp cookware: ReviewerScott Gilbertsonfamouslylives in an RV, so he is always testingcamp cookware. In fact, grills and other cookware are tested for months before they ever make it into a guide. He cooks outside every day, rotating stoves every few months so he gets a good sense of how they perform, how they stand up to weather, and how hard they are to clean. Tents: We aim to spend at least a week in every tent, ideally in a variety of weather conditions. Every pocket, zipper, guy line, and feature is tested. Will the rainfly catch on the door zippers? Is the ventilation good? Is the tent easy to set up? We assess all of the above and more, and list our favorites in ourBest Tentsbuying guide. Meal kits: When testingmeal kit delivery services, each service is evaluated meal-by-meal over the course of a few days. Our lead reviewer follows recipes to the letter and substitutes ingredients only if something arrives inedible—for example, if something thaws during shipment or the produce is moldy (these substitutions are always noted). She always has at least one other person try a meal and notes down both of their first impressions and opinions before discussing the meal further. She assesses packaging, ingredient quality, texture, and taste, then factors in price to make recommendations. Security cameras:Indoorandoutdoor security camerasare tested for at least one month. We test any manufacturer claims and special features, like motion detection or smartphone alerts, and stress-test the cameras as well. We also test videofeed quality and loading times. Video doorbells: We testvideo doorbellsfor a minimum of two weeks. Any manufacturer claims are tested and verified, as are smartphone companion apps or smart home connectivity options. We also consider the data storage, retention, and privacy policies of the manufacturers of each camera we test, as these things also factor into our recommendations. Sex toys and tech: We testsex techfor a minimum of two weeks using common sense. We test on different erogenous zones and different bodies. We also conduct controlled tests for features like battery life, waterproofness, and ease of cleaning. We test manufacturer claims as well. Espresso machines and coffee gear: We useespresso machinesandcoffee gearfor at least two weeks in everyday situations. We also perform some controlled tests. Our lead reviewer tests for consistency, how hot the heating elements get, how quickly they heat up, how much time needs to pass between switching functions (brewing versus steaming), and the like. She also tests general usability. Is the machine easy to clean and maintain? Are things that need to be cleaned easily accessible? Does it look nice on the counter or does it seem to acquire a grime after only a couple uses? Does the steaming wand work efficiently? All of these factors inform our assessment. Coffee grinders: Our lead reviewer assessescoffee grindersfor at least two weeks using a mix of everyday use and controlled tests. She’s mostly testing for consistency, as well as factors like how quickly grime builds up in the burrs, how accessible the burrs are for cleaning, how loud the grinder is, and how finely or coarsely it can grind. She also assesses for ease of cleaning and overall maintenance requirements. Digital cameras: We testcamerasby using them over a period of (ideally) months, but often just weeks because DSLR cameras, compact system cameras, and mirrorless cameras are generally loaned to us on a short-term basis, and camera companies are eager to pass them on to the next reviewer. Our lead reviewer tries to shoot at least 500 images on every camera he tests. He then views and edits the resulting RAW and JPG files in Darktable. Coolers: We testcoolersby putting a standard bag of cube ice inside it on a warm day (at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit), putting the cooler in the shade, and then timing how long it takes for the ice to melt. We also assess weight, portability, durability, and overall design. Binoculars: We testbinocularsby going birding. And to baseball games. And stargazing. For months and months.

    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Many powerful companiesmake a practice of obfuscating or dodging accountability when speaking to media outlets by providing information while insisting it not be attributed to anyone in particular, and sometimes not even to the company itself. For that reason, WIRED is joiningthe Verge,Quartz, and others in making its editorial standards clearer. Anyone talking to WIRED reporters in any official capacity does soon the recordby default. This means that what you say or write can be quoted and attributed to you by name, not just as “a company spokesperson.” We typically allow anonymity only to sources who could face retaliation or be endangered by the information they provide, and when we do so we explain our reasons to readers. AsJulia Angwin, editor in chief of the Markup, has noted, “Corporate spokespeople who are paid to provide information simply don’t meet the criteria for being granted anonymity.” Sometimes we may agree to have a conversationon background,meaning we can use the information you provide, but will not identify you by name. Conversations are on backgroundonly when we agree to it. If you send us a statement “on background” without prior agreement, we may still treat it as on the record. You must also get our agreement for each proposed condition of the conversation, such as requests to not quote a particular statement directly or to identify a source in a certain way. Please be clear about your exact requests every time you speak with WIRED. At our discretion we may also tell our readers why we’re providing the information in this way. Off-the-recordconversations cannot be used for publication, and they also must be agreed to (which we rarely do for corporate spokespeople). The companies you speak for play significant roles in shaping the future; we have a responsibility to tell our readers how we got the information about your plans to shape it.

    "news_title": "16 Best Mattresses You Can Buy Online (2024) | Tested and Reviewed | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more. Buying a mattressonline can be a waking nightmare, and picking the wrong one can literally cause bad dreams or kill your back. It doesn't help that the online market is flooded with options and that there are more dedicated mattress review sites than stars in the sky. Years ago, we started this guide by filling a room with dozens of mattresses from top bed-in-a-box companies and spending several days examining, reclining, and even jumping on each of them. We've since upgraded our protocol to ensure we're conducting the most thorough real-life testing you'll find anywhere. Our testers now spend weeks or months sleeping on each mattress; we recommend only mattresses that WIRED reviewers have spent at least seven nights sleeping on in their homes. These are our favorites. Be sure to read our other sleep guides, including theBest Mattresses for Side Sleepers,Best Organic Mattresses,Best Bed Sheets,Best Bed Frames,Best Mattresses on Amazon,andBest Sleep Trackers. Updated August 2024: We've added the Saatva Contour5, the Allswell Supreme hybrid, and the Charles P. Rogers Estate Tradition Mattress, which is our new top pick for anyone battling back pain. There's a fresh note about Nectar, which has relaunched its lineup with new materials and has been removed pending testing. We have removed three of our alternate picks and updated pricing throughout. Former WIRED editor Jeffrey Van Camp tested several mattresses over the years, but this is the only one that put him to sleep immediately after just a few minutes of lying on it. Helix's Midnight Luxe has a plush cushion top and a medium-firm feel that's relaxing whether you're a side, back, or stomach sleeper. (He's most definitely a stomach sleeper.) Helix mattresses are hybrids with a base of individually wrapped inner springs that are firmer in areas that need more support to prevent back pain, like your lower spine. On top is a stratum of cooling gel foam and denser foams. There are six layers in all and the mattress is more than 13 inches high. It's cozy, and Helix has avariety of other mattressesthat cater to different sleeping positions and firmness preferences. Helix is almost vertically integrated—the springs are made from bales of wire cut in the company's Arizona factory, where it has recently started pouring its own foam. Let’s face it: No one goes looking to buy a new mattress because they’re sleeping too well on their old one. Depending on what issues are disturbing your rest, the Leesa Sapira Chill may be the tonic for what ails you. That’s especially true if you struggle with a few interrelated problems—like getting too hot so you kick your covers off and roll over in the process, twisting your spine. TheLeesa Sapira hybridwas our longtime runner-up to the Helix and it’s still a mattress we endorse. But after two weeks of testing, the Sapira Chill won me over. Not only does it provide a nice dose of cooling thanks to a fabric cover that pulls heat away from the body, but it also delivers deep comfort via four foam layers and three different types of coil, which are artfully arranged in zones that gracefully align your hips. The Sapira's structure eliminated my periodic lower back pain in testing. (The next mattress I tested, the Magnistretch in the avoid section below, brought that pain back with a vengeance!) The Leesa Sapira Chill is an affordable luxury mattress, with a plush quilted pillowtop and three available firmness levels. It has a little more springiness than other hybrids thanks to a bouncy responsive foam layer that takes the place of memory foam in many other hybrid mattresses. You also get premium touches like an outer ring of extra-firm springs for excellent edge support and a chemical-free and fiberglass-free barrier against fires. There’s a 100-night at-home trial with free shipping and free returns. Most people are side sleepers. The stats vary by study and how you define side sleeping, but between half and three-quarters of people sleep mostly on their side. It's important to find a mattress that strikes a perfect balance between cushion and support. The Bear Elite is a five-layer hybrid mattress that's 14 inches thick and firmer than most other side sleeper mattresses. Your initial impression might be that a squishy memory foam mattress is better—my experience is that sinking too much gets old after a while. The Bear's top layer is a quilted pillowtop made from a cooling fabric that sits above a layer of cooling copper-infused foam. There's a single layer of springs of varied rigidity so your hips can sink a bit without your back coming out of alignment. It's a sturdy mattress and comes with a 120-night trial period (plus a lifetime warranty). The Bear Elite is now my daily driver—I've been sleeping on this mattress for six months any time I'm not testing another mattress or traveling—and it's the pick I suggest to anyone who tells me they're a side sleeper unless they have other sleeping problems they're looking to address. Read ourBest Mattresses for Side Sleepers guidefor other picks. WIRED reviewer Adrienne So likes a firm mattress. And by “firm” she means “rock hard.” She finds sleeping on aquarter-inch of foamover dirt to be both relaxing and good for her back. The Plank's high-density support foam took a few hours to fully inflate, which left both So and her spouse with a misleading initial impression of too much softness. But after a few days, the mattress firmed up considerably. The 0.75-inch quilted top is barely perceptible. It's like sleeping on a clean wooden floor (this is a good thing for her). If this is too much for you, you can flip it over to sleep on two inches of comfort foam on the underside. But let’s be honest, if you’re ordering a mattress called the Plank, you probably don’t want to do that. The foam also doesn’t move laterally, meaning kids can hop in and out of the parental bed with minimal shaking. Her one complaint is that the edges could use more support; she has slipped off the sides a few times while putting on her socks. ★ Not quite so firm:After two months of testing, WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe was struck by the firmness of theBrooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe Cooling Mattress ($1,586). It's not as firm as the Plank (which is also made by Brooklyn Bedding), but that could be a good thing depending on your sleeping preferences. As a side sleeper, she thinks a plush topper would be a fantastic addition to the mattress, but her back-sleeping partner (who often complains that the mattresses she reviews aretoo soft) is a big fan. The hybrid bed is available in three firmness levels and the cooling features of this mattress are also effective. The top layer feels cold to the touch, even through layers of sheets. Her only complaint is that those cooling fibers are so slippery that her fitted sheet kept slipping off. The Avocado Green hybrid mattress is the only mattress WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson and his wife agree on. She likes a soft mattress, and he prefers a firm one. This model somehow manages to be both without being too much of either. Despite more than a year of sleeping on it, there's zero sagging or other issues. If you prefer a soft feel, there's a pillow-top option. The Avocado's best trick is that it's incredibly comfortableandenvironmentally friendly. It's 11 inches thick and is constructed in California from organic latex, organic wool, and organic cotton. It contains no polyurethane, fire retardants, memory foam, or chemical adhesives, according to the company. It offers a one-year trial, a 25-year warranty, and free shipping. Better yet, the company is alsoa certified B Corporationthat's purchasing enough offsets to say it operates as a carbon-negative business. Read ourBest Organic Mattresses guidefor more sustainable options. Birch's high-end Luxe model is a great side-sleeping mattress, just like its standard model, but its medium-firm feel and structured support make it a more versatile pick for a variety of sleeping styles. It's also an organic mattress and isGOTS-certified, using natural latex with no polyurethane-based foams. The Luxe mattress employs multiple layers of wool, plus a layer of individually wrapped coils, which provide support and some cushioning. It has a pillowy Euro top that helps with temperature regulation, and the coils provide full lumbar support while maintaining a satisfyingly stiff edge on all four sides. My sleep rings have been spinning themselves closed during my month of testing this mattress. Our top pick, Helix, has anElite collectionthat consists of six new mattresses along a spectrum of softness. Those hybrid mattresses come in two separate boxes, each heavy enough to require help lifting. The firmness is dictated by the foam density of the upper layer, which zips into a larger support system. In theory, this makes the mattress adjustable if you end up regretting your order. The bottom section has two separate layers of tiny springs called microcoils. Helix says you need to pair this with a bed frame that has slats (not a traditional box-spring frame). Helix advertises the Elite as \"the tallest mattress on the internet,\" and at 16 inches, it is indeed the Shaq of boxed mattresses. I spent a month sleeping on the softest model from the Elite line, dubbed the Sunset, and appreciated the deep cradling effect. Most people prefer a mattress that cools them as they sleep—like many on this list, Helix claims to use a special fabric that dissipates body heat, and it indeed remains remarkably cool even when you're settled in. Helix offers a 100-day trial period on all of its mattresses. Review and demonstration of the Helix Sleep Midnight Luxe mattress. There’s a lot to look for whenyou’re battling back pain. If the source is a chronic injury or damage in your back, you’ll want plenty of firm support to help keep your back and spine supported and aligned. But if you’re also a side sleeper or have pain from pressure points in your back and side, you’ll also want something soft enough that you can sleep comfortably. WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell suffers from near-constant back pain due to a combination of scoliosis and spondylosis (degradation of cartilage in the spine) and her favorite mattress to sleep on to keep back pain away is the Charles P. Rogers Tradition Estate Mattress. This Florida-made mattress is gently firm, with seven layers of gel, foam, and springs. The quilted top was soft enough that she could comfortably sleep on her side and wake up from zero pressure point pain. It’s also got a nice spring to it, making it easy for her to hop out of bed—and keeping her from hurting herself before the day even begins. Charles P. Rogers allows returns and exchanges within 100 days of delivery, and the mattress also has five years of complete coverage against manufacturing issues plus 10 more years of prorated coverage. ★A softer option:If you’re looking for more pressure relief and something a little softer, the seven-layerSaatva Rx ($2,945)erases muscle aches and pressure pains with ease overnight. It’s a little too soft if you have a chronic injury like spondylosis, but still has a nice spring to it to make it easy to rise in the morning. The Contour5 is a new mattress from Saatva, replacing the popularLoom & Leafin the company's lineup. As with other Saatva mattresses, it is not roll-packed and comes delivered on a moving truck. The Contour5 has two firmness options and updated cooling tech that uses airflow channels in its gel foam layer which is thinner than its predecessor, meaning it retains less heat. In my two weeks of testing, I found the Countour 5 was very good at remaining cool through summer nights which is extra impressive given that it uses very dense 5-pound-weight memory foam. The Contour5 is soft enough for side sleeping without feeling like a saggy hammock and has excellent build quality which is impressive for an all-foam mattress without springs. I prefer a hybrid with microcoils, but Saatva is popular for a reason, and as all-foam mattresses go it has a true luxury feel—which it should given it's triple the price of the all-foam Casper below. Casper put the American bed-in-a-box market on the map when it debuted in 2014. Its innovative marketing led to the complete corporate ride: multiple rounds of venture capital funding, an eventual IPO, then a private equity acquisition, and subsequent de-listing. If all this finance talk didn’t cause you to drift off to sleep, the newly launched The One probably will. A decade later, Casper retired its core products and relaunched with The One as its base model in its five-deep lineup. I was a little skeptical, but The One impressed me after a week of sleep testing. This is an all-foam mattress that stands 11 inches tall. Because it's all foam, it’s on the light side, with a queen weighing an easily movable 66 pounds. One of the main issues with all-foam mattresses is that they get too hot, but Casper’s The One uses an open-cell foam layer called Breathe Flex Foam on the top, which makes it both pleasantly squishy and breathable. Two more layers of foam add up to a medium-firm feel, with the middle layer designed to cradle your hips, and the base layer designed to provide support. It's all wrapped in a knit cover so soft it’s a shame to cover it in sheets. As with any all-foam mattress, you sacrifice edge support, though these are decently stiff. The One feels like a classic Casper, but upgraded in ways that help it keep pace with the increasingly competitive mattress market. It's our favorite all-foam mattress at the moment. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu sleept on the WinkBed for almost two years and he was quite happy in that time. His favorite perk? The edge support is fantastic so his partner never wakes when he slips into bed late at night. The plush pillowtop also adds a luxe hotel-like feel to a relatively firm bed. (He tried the Luxury Firm, but there are three other choices.) He is a stomach and back sleeper; his partner, often a side sleeper, says it's a bit too firm. The WinkBed is a US-made hybrid mattress with an eco-friendly Tencel cover that wicks moisture and has individually wrapped coils for excellent support. The company says it works well with most bed frames (as long as there's rigid center support). There's a 120-night trial and a full-replacement lifetime warranty. WIRED contributor Nicole Kinning has slept on a half-dozen cooling mattresses in the past few months and says the Purple Restore Cool Touch mattress is the best on the market right now, providing effective cooling while being extremely comfortable. Derived from the flagship Purple Restore, this cool version features the company's distinctive GelFlex layer, a rubbery grid beneath the mattress surface that provides just the right amount of bounce. That layer is supportive and not so bouncy that it’ll wake a sleeping partner. We’d also assert that this springy gel layer enhances the overall coolness of the bed, offering a refreshing sleep environment, especially when compared to foam-top mattresses that are more likely to trap heat. Beneath the GelFlex grid lies a dense and supportive polyfoam and pocketed cooling coils. This structure is enclosed by the signature eggplant-colored fabric bottom. The true star of the show covers the mattress’s interior: a lightweight yarn-woven surface, which remains noticeably chilly to the touch. ★ A softer cooling option:If you’re a smaller person or want a cooling mattress on the softer side, consider theNectar Premier Copper ($1,249). It’s 14 inches thick, with a gel memory foam top layer that offers a lot of cradling. I’m a bigger guy and sunk in too deep for my liking while my 90-pound daughter floated comfortably on top. But even as I sank I never got hot—that’s thanks to the infused copper fibers that wick away heat along with what Nectar calls an “activeCool HD-infused phase change material” in the gel layer. Like the Saatva we recommend for beating back pain above, this is another mattress that doesn't come roll-packed in a box. Serta is one of the nation's largest mattress makers and has been around for nearly a century. Its Perfect Sleeper (in the Ultimate support firmness with a plush pillowtop) strikes an excellent balance between softness and support. You will need to schedule delivery by truck, but unlike old-school mattresses, it does not require a box spring. Serta's sister brand, Simmons,invented the woven wire spring mattress, and the heart of the Perfect Sleeper is an assortment of coils, arranged in three zones of firmness that are well engineered for both side and back sleeping. The mattress sits 14 inches high, among the tallest on this list. Serta has updated materials around those springs, using antimicrobial layers to prevent the mattress from getting stinky and a foam to keep it cool. On my week of testing, it felt refreshingly sturdy, with nice edge support. ★ A new classic:Cloverlane is the luxury label from Resident Home, which also makes the Nectar and Awara mattresses on this list. TheCloverlane Hybrid Firm ($1,399)is not a mattress in a box, but rather a 15-inch classic mattress that’s delivered by a moving truck. I spent a week testing the hybrid firm version. The Cloverlane has a unique spongy, devoted cloth cover with some heat-wicking properties. This mattress offers extreme motion isolation. I never felt like I even depressed the coils. And yet, it was comfortable as the foam layers provided plenty of cushion. I’m primarily a side sleeper but had my best sleep on the Cloverlane when I rolled over to my stomach. Given the luxury feel and high-touch service (the company called multiple times to arrange delivery and then again to check on my experience), this is the mattress I would readily recommend to my mother if she were shopping for a new bed. The Allswell Supreme 14-inch hybrid mattress is listed as having medium firmness, but it was by far the most plush of the “medium-firm” mattressesI’ve tested. I’m a smaller person, so I imagine someone with a bigger frame or weight would sink into this and find it even more plush. Considering it's less than $500, the mattress has an elaborate construction with lots of layers. The top layer is 1 1/2 inches of this Walmart house brand's signature quilted Euro top, which gives it a plush feel. There's also 1 inch of copper-infused memory foam which helps with moisture absorption to keep it cool, and 2 inches of “fast response” memory foam, which absorbs motion and bounces back into shape quickly. Below that you get 3/4 inch of high-density medium support foam to further absorb motion. The bulk of the bottom is 8 inches of encased coils, which means each coil is encased individually and moves independently to easier contour to the shape of your body. At the very bottom is 3/4 inch of shock-absorbing high-density foam. My niece and nephew proclaimed it was the “bounciest” bed to jump on—they’re not wrong, as the mattress absorbs weight and movement before quickly springing back up. The soft plush top enveloped the curves of my body as a side sleeper without being too firm and causing hip or back problems, which happened when I tested other “medium firm” mattresses. One of the biggest cons was the lack of edge support. When sitting on the edge of the bed, the top layer completely buckled and met the top of the box spring support, and I could literally slide off the mattress if I wasn’t supporting myself properly. I like a softer mattress, so this was comfortable for me, but I think if I wanted something truly medium-firm I would be disappointed. It's a great value with free shipping, and was easy to get out of the package and quickly sprung up from its vacuum seal, although if you’re looking for something truly medium-firm, I think this mattress is too soft.—Molly Higgins You're going to spend roughly a third of your life on a mattress unless you're plagued by bad habits andstaying up late. In my opinion, that makes bedding a bad place to cheap out. But, if you're on a very tight budget you could do worse than the Linenspa hybrid mattress. This is one of those Amazon products with more than 100,000reviews of questionable provenance. I was unable to make contact with the company directly, so I bought it. When I cracked the heavy (75-pound) box open to let the springs and foam breathe, my impressions didn’t improve. The Linenspa’s outer shell is baggy with bunching in weird places. The memory foam layer is uneven and in one corner seems to disappear. The edge support is also uneven. I was surprisingly comfortable from the first night and held up fairly well for several weeks. Side sleepers will surely notice the springs are a little creaky, with no motion isolation. Sometimes those springs make you feel like you’re floating on an uneven cloud—pricier mattresses avoid this by varying the size of springs in different zones—but the overall feel is supportive and comfortable. Having spent weeks testing mattresses priced between $300 and $4,000, I can say you get what you pay for. But this is a fine option if you can't spend more. Nectar has been a staple of this guide for years, first as our top pick for side sleepers and later as the best pick for pressure relief. Nectar and the rest of the Resident Home portfolio wassold to Ashley Furniture in March 2024and the lineup is relaunching with new materials and design. Because we have not tested the new designs, we have removed Nectar from our best mattress list pending testing of the new models. There are a few mattresses we tested that don't stand out as much but are decent and worth mentioning, in case you're thinking about them. Awara Hybrid Mattress for $1,049:This is a solid organic mattress made from organic latex, organic wool, and individually wrapped springs. WIRED reviewerLouryn Strampefound it springy and comfortable, especially for a single sleeper, though it's a floppier mattress that could benefit from a little more support. Emma Hybrid Comfort for $659:This medium-firmness hybrid mattress has many of the same features as the hybrids we've picked above though it's not quite as comfortable. The zoned support sections are less noticeably different and I thought it slept a little too warm in my week of testing. Naturepedic EOS for $3,499: Think of this as an organic cousin to the Helix Elite above, as it's also a big and sturdy mattress that comes in three boxes to be assembled. If you're looking for an organic hybrid mattress that allows customization, Naturepedic's EOS is a solid (if expensive) choice. I ordered this in firm to see how I slept after months of medium mattresses and it was indeed firm, with springs that only started to soften after three weeks of on-and-off sleeping and a lot of jumping by my 9-year-old daughter. You can swap out layers for free for 100 nights, which means finding just the right firmness. Note that it's a heavy mattress thanks to the natural latex layer but it's sturdy enough that the company offers a 25-year limited warranty. There are some models you should avoid. Many of these beds are extremely affordable, and if you aren't picky, they may feel fine. In other cases, the mattress is decent but the price is not. You'll spend a third of your life on a mattress, which means picking the right one is important. Start with your preferred sleeping position and how much support you need. Here are a few tips. Should you buy a firm or soft mattress?Generally, heavier people and back or stomach sleepers will do better with firmer mattresses, while lighter people and side sleepers enjoy softer mattresses. Temperature is also an issue: Softer mattresses sleep warmer since your body is sinking into a layer of fabric and foam. Keep in mind that all mattresses have a break-in period, and the way the mattress feels on your first night won't be how it feels after a week or two. Do you want a hybrid or foam mattress?The next big question is whether you want a foam mattress or a hybrid model that layers foam with built-in springs. We tend to recommend hybrids because they are more stable and supportive, and they usually stay cooler. Hybrids are often slightly pricier. Foam mattresses tend to be softer, lighter, and cheaper. What size mattress do you need?The prices below are based on the queen size, but almost all mattresses come in the standard sizes of Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, and California King. You'll want to buy a mattress based on thesize of your bed frame. How easy is it to set up a bed-in-a-box?Most of these mattresses are delivered in a box, vacuum-sealed, and rolled up. Some are pretty heavy—up to 150 pounds—so be sure you have someone to help you. After you unroll your bed-in-a-box mattress and cut the vacuum bag open, it'll immediately begin to inflate, so unbox it on your bed frame or near it. We have a helpful guide onhow to set up the mattress you bought onlinewith more tips. The mattresses are usually ready to go in a few hours, but most manufacturers recommend giving them two days to reach their normal state. Should you wait for a sale to buy a mattress?Mattresses go on sale often. If you see one at full price, there's a strong chance you can save hundreds of dollars by waiting for the next big sale event (every few months). What if you don't like the mattress you bought online?Most of the mattresses we have tested and recommend have at least a 100-night testing period and a 10-year warranty. You may want to look at the company's policy as you may be on the hook for a nominal return fee.

For years, electricbicycles were bulky, inconvenient, expensive machines with limited battery life. Slowly, that has changed. Ebikes are now lighter, more attractive, and more powerful than ever. You don't need to be physically fit to ride one. They get you outside, reduce traffic congestion, and shrink your carbon footprint. I ride one dailyto take my kids to school. They're justfun. How We Test Over the past few years, WIRED's Reviews team has tried almost every kind of electric bike, fromthe best heavy-duty cargo bikestohigh-end mountain bikes. We review upward of 50 new ebikes a year by riding them on a variety of terrain for at least 40 miles over the course of at least two weeks. We test cargo bikes by hauling kids and groceries, we ride mountain and gravel bikes on trails, and we test commuter bikes while running errands on regular city streets (including up and down steep hills). In addition to our real-life testing, we also evaluate specs like weight, tire size, battery life, motor power, and the sourcing of key components. For more information, check out our guide onHow to Buy an Electric Bike. It CostsWhatNow? Whenever I talk to anyone about a possible ebike purchase, the biggest deterrent is usually the price. We're currently working on a guide to more affordable ebikes, but we think of them as vehicles, not toys. When you're carrying kids to school or flying down a hill at 25 mph with only a helmet for protection, you don't want to skimp on brakes. Reasonable auto financing options are theonlyreason a $2,000 electric bike can feel prohibitively expensive while a $6,000 beater gas-powered car has easy monthly payments. Many states now featureincentive programsthat offer rebates or tax credits for ebike purchases. Some bike manufacturers and retailersoffer financingthrough companies like Affirm or PayPal. Your bank might cover ebikes under its vehicle loan program, and I also recommendlooking at eBay locally, Craigslist, or local Facebook groups. You probably have more options than you think. Ebike Classifications and Rules Before you buy your electric bike, make sure you can actually use it! Many cities and states have laws regulating when and where you can ride an ebike. Check out ourguide on the three classes of ebikes. At least 22 states now usethis three-class system, and they may restrict when and where different classes of ebikes are used, depending on whether they have a throttle or can assist above 20 mph. Cities may also have laws about whether mountain ebikes are allowed on single-track trails. If your state classifies ebikes under the same laws governing motorcycles and mopeds, you may need a license to ride one. And no matter what, alwayswear a helmet. You know that. If you don't see what you want, check back later (or drop me a note!). Once you buy an ebike, check out ourBest Bike Accessories,Best Bike Locks, and theBest Ebikes for Elderly Riders. Not into pedaling? Read ourBest Escootersguide for other transport options. Updated October 2024: We added the REI Co-op Cycles CTY e2.1, the Lectric XPress, the Trek Slash 9.7 XLS/XT, the Priority e-Classic Plus, Mod Easy, the Radio Flyer Via Pro, and the Cannondale Moterra SL 2. We also updated links and prices. Special offer for Gear readers:Get WIRED for just $5 ($25 off). This includes unlimited access toWIRED.com, full Gear coverage, and subscriber-only newsletters. Subscriptions help fund the work we do every day. The prices on direct-to-consumer bikes are very appealing, but if you wouldn't send your kid down a hill on a skateboard with wobbly wheels, I wouldn't recommend doing the same yourself. If this is your first bike, I strongly suggest going with an established manufacturer that has a large support network of affiliated retailers and shops, so you can test a few and not have to assemble or fix it yourself. $2,000 is about what I'd expect to spend on a durable, good-quality entry-level electric bike. Almost every major bike manufacturer now makes an entry-level commuter electric bicycle. Right now, the most reasonably priced one is the Trek FX+ 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It comes in two versions: a step-over and a step-through. (I'm currently riding the step-through.) At 40 pounds, it's pretty light! It rides a lot like the light, versatile hybrid I rode all through college. It has Trek's proprietary 250-watt hub motor, a 250-watt-hour battery, standard 9-speed Shimano shifters, fast road bike wheels, and hydraulic disc brakes, as well as a few fun extra built-ins, like integrated lights, a bell, a rear rack, fenders, and a kickstand. All in all, it's a shockingly affordable package for everything you need to start your 6-mile city commute. ★ Alternatives:We have tried almost all the entry-level brand-name bikes. Specializedmakes onethat's pricier but with a nicer low-maintenance internal gear hub and belt drive, and we likeCannondale's versionas well. Outdoor retailer REI sells a few versions of its city commuter line. The most bare-bones version is theCTY e1.1 ($1,299)but I think it's worth it to upgrade to theCTY e2.1, which is still well under $2,000 and goes on sale a lot. It's aclass 1 ebikewith a 250-watt Suntour HESC motor, a 418-Wh battery, and a whole host of commuter extras, like front suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, big 2-inch-wide tires, gel grips, lights, and a hefty kickstand. At this price, it's not the fanciest bike out there. It weighs a hefty 54 pounds, and it has a little less torque than some of our other picks—so it might not have quite enough oomph to get you up some of the bigger hills. But you don't need an app to use it, and it's very reasonably priced. If you live near an REI, the store shop will assemble it and offer you discounts on maintenance and free tubes, and you have a 365-day return policy. This has been my daily ride for a few weeks, and Lectric’s bikes have seriously improved since the company was founded in 2020. The XPress rides like a much more “bikey” bike, with a much more traditional (and comfortable!) frame and a new torque sensor that makes pedaling feel much more natural. Its 86 Nm of torque is powerful enough to get up the steepest hill in my neighborhood, Battery Killer, even though I have found the range to be much less than the promised 60 miles. Using the throttle generously, I get around 25 miles. But I’m only 115 pounds, and the range really should be better than that, so much so that I don't recommend going down to the cheaperXPress 500 ($999). Still, for zipping around your neighborhood as fast as possible, this is a pretty great bike for the price. It gets up to 28 mph quickly. The LCD display is huge, bright, and easy to read, and the controls are easy to use and understand. You don't need an app, and it has hydraulic disc brakes, integrated lights, the works. Lectric is a direct-to-consumer company, but its assembly process is also one of the easiest that I've experienced. This is the easiest entry-level electric bike right now. Trek took the frame of its popular Slash mountain bike and added a motor and battery to create the quietest, most natural-feeling electric mountain bike that our reviewer Steph Pearson has ever tested. It has two standout features. The TQ motor has a pin ring drive transmission, which replaces the whirring gears and cogs of a normal motor with two rings with differently-sized pins (it's physics, look it up). Also, there's an extra idler pulley to take up slack on the chain and reduce pedal kickback, which is when your pedals suddenly reverse direction when you're not paying attention and claw at your shins. The result is a delightful, floaty ride that gives you just enough assistance when you need it and doesn't feel like you're trying to drive a tank through tight, technical turns. Pearson did note a small persistent rattle that neither she, nor her bike shop, could identify or fix, but that seems a small downside considering how fun this bike is otherwise. I've been waiting for a major bike manufacturer to release an affordable, reliable daily driver that can be a car substitute. Specialized's Globe Haul ST (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the company's first light cargo ebike, and it's a winner. It fits a wide variety of heights. The powerful 700-watt motor relies on an IPX7-rated battery that has a remarkable range of well over the stated 60 miles. The display is intuitive and the pedaling feels natural. The compact 20-inch multi-terrain wheels are maneuverable and feel stable on roads, dirt, and gravel. The proprietary accessories pull in partners like Fjallraven and are attractive and versatile. I just have two small qualms: There's no suspension, which can make a difference if you're carrying a lot of things and people; and there's no belt drive. However, Specialized uses quality components and has a large network of affiliated shops to get routine maintenance. This is the bike that everyone in my family—me, my husband, and my two kids—asks to ride whenever we leave the house. If you want an electric bike, do not be put off by fears of battery fires—new legislationand new technology make each iteration of electric bike safer than the one before. For example, this year Seattle-basedRad Power Bikesintroduced a new technology called Safe Shield, in which the batteries are encapsulated in heat-absorbing resin to extinguish a fire, much like the batteries in an electric car. If you're at all concerned about electric battery fires, one of the bikes in the new line-up, like the Radster Road (8/10, WIRED Recommends), would be your best pick. (It's also worth noting that every bike in our roundup has UL certification, which means that it meets the safety requirements for a top third-party testing agency.) The Radster Road is a long-distance commuter that is UL-certified, with big, efficient 29-inch Kenda tires, anIPX6-rated750-watt rear hub motor, and a 720-Wh proprietary semi-integrated battery. It has a truly ridiculous range (I put about 30 miles on it and only wore the battery down halfway) and comes with a ton of stuff at a very reasonable price. For example, you can switch betweenebike classesin the computer, and it has a new torque sensor that makes pedaling feel infinitely more natural. It's also a lot quieter than other bikes at this price.  It does weigh almost 75 pounds, though. If you’re after an affordable pedal-assist bike that’s equal parts form and function, this loaded beach cruiser from Priority could be a great fit. For under $2,000, you’re getting head-turning style and high-end features, including a low-maintenance carbon belt drive, a center-mount kickstand, motor-sensing hydraulic brakes, and a built-in brake light on the back fender. At just 49 pounds, the bike is easy to pack and maneuver, though all those extras mean you’ll likely want to have it assembled at a local shop. I love how easy it is to get on the road thanks to the e-Classic’s step-in design (there’s also a step-over model) and intuitive control hub. There’s even an optional throttle, perfect for navigating tricky terrain or coasting a few notches below the 20 mph top speed. With only three gears and three motor speeds, there’s less granularity in choice for different topography than something like the Propella 9S Pro, and the eager motor feels more like a scooter than a natural extension of your body. Still, with around 30 to 40 miles of range and one of the comfiest seats you’ll ever mount, this bike is a solid commuter that’s easy to fall for.—Ryan Waniata If you're a road cyclist who wants the lightest bike around so that you can commute 15 miles to work and pop through a park on your way home, the bike you're looking for is the Santa Cruz Skitch (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It has an extremely light carbon fiber frame, with an equally light but powerful Fazua 60 motor and a 430-watt-hour battery. It's a class 3 ebike and also the lightest electric bike I've ever tried. My tester came with all the fixings, including a dropper seat post and a very fancy SRAM button transmission that let me click through gears easily and seamlessly, with no exposed cabling. I cackled with glee as I tried to race a Dodge Challenger home in my neighborhood and swung through a cyclocross course. Of course, it does cost $6,000, which puts a damper on your gleeful commuting—one does not simply leave a Ferrari parked and unattended in front of the 7-Eleven at midnight. But if you have a 10-mile commute and access to a locked garage, this would be my pick. ★ Alternative:I love the Skitch, but if all you want is a lightweight commuter and to save a couple grand, you could probably go with the Specialized Turbo Vado SL (9/10, WIRED Recommends) and be totally fine. It's made from aluminum instead of carbon fiber, it weighs a little more, and the motor is slightly less powerful. But you'd still have a pretty fun time. TheR&M Loadused to be my top pick for abakfiets,a Dutch-style front-box cargo bicycle. However, the Urban Arrow Family (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is cheaper—not by a little—and offers many of the same features that attracted me to the Load, like comfort and maneuverability. It doesn't have suspension, though, so it's best for smoother streets. I love the Enviolo continuously variable shifters, which allow you to downshift while the bike is at a standstill. Rather than wobbling and terrifying my children as I frantically downshift while pedaling, I can use walk assistance to push the bike to a convenient spot, downshift while standing still, and then pedal upward at the torque and power level of my choice. With this system, I've beaten people uphill whoweren'triding cargo bikes. There is also a version with the more powerfulBosch Cargo Line motor. ★ Alternative:I feel obligated to point out here that the bike I use to tote around my own family (andcargo all over Portland) is theTern GSD S00(8/10, WIRED Recommends). The Bosch Cargo Line motor is powerful enough to speedily transport me and two kids to school and back every day, along with all of our backpacks, groceries, and gear, and it's small enough that it takes up only a reasonable amount of space in our garage. I first rode one with my daughter when she was 3, and we can still ride it now that she's 9. The first cargo bike from this leader in competitively priced, direct-to-consumer ebikes is a study in flexibility. Carting the kiddo to school? Adda back seat ($63)anda handrail ($122)to the long rear platform. Blissfully child-free? Installfrontandrear racks ($70, $159)to haul groceries and garden supplies. The easy-riding step-through frame fits pilots up to 6'3\" tall. The Abound’s pedal assistance system uses a rear hub motor with a torque sensor, a design that adds a smooth and even boost based on how hard you’re cranking. In the lowest of the four assistance levels—the power-sipping yet capable Eco mode—you can eke out 50 miles on a charge. Your mileage drops if you load the bike up to its 440-pound capacity, liberally thumb the bar-mounted throttle, or blast around town in Turbo mode at the max speed of 20 mph. Even then, you’ll still get nearly 20 miles out of the 720-watt-hour battery.—Michael Calore ★ Alternative:I have also ridden and like theLectric XPedition ($1,399). It's the easiest cargo bike to assemble out of the box that I've experienced, fits a wide variety of riders, and comes with a huge array of proprietary accessories. The only bad part? It's so popular that it constantly goes in and out of stock. This ebike comes with a few major caveats. It's a direct-to-consumer bike, and we contracted with a local service to assemble it at my house. However, several parts were missing or unusable, and we had to wait a day for replacements. Also, the company claims that the minimum height is 5'2\", but I am 5'2\" and can't fit on it. The seat post tapers, so it can't be cut. I had to sub my own seat in, so I didn't get to use the comfy, beautiful saddle with suspension that comes with this bike. I find the laid-back, Harley-style seating difficult to maneuver while riding, which is probably related to the fact that overall, I'm just a little too short to ride this. However, my family and I really like this sidecar style. The sidecar can carry up to 150 pounds, so anyone in my family can ride it, with a special shout-out to my dog, who loves it. I also love that you can quickly detach the sidecar, so it's versatile and easy to store in my crowded garage. It has everything you need—a 750-watt hub motor with a throttle, a big, easy-to-read color display, and hydraulic disc brakes. If you want to cosplay as Indiana Jones and Dad Jones in the Last Crusade, this is the bike to get. Note:Jackrabbit has a newOG2 ($1250)that I have, but have not currently tested! We will update this roundup once I've done that. The next big trend in electric bikes is micro-mobility, which refers to tiny personal vehicles. Tiny bikes are more affordable, easier to transport, and easier to store. And just likeminianything, really, they're completely irresistible. So far, my favorite micro bike is the JackRabbit (7/10, WIRED Recommends). It weighs an astonishingly light 23 pounds, is simple to assemble out of the box, and can fold down to save even more space. It doesn't have pedals, so you won't hit yourself in the chin with your knees; instead, you toggle a thumb throttle to accelerate. My only caveat is that the tiny battery and motor aren't very powerful. I'm only 115 pounds, and slamming on the throttle only gets me to about 10 mph. Also, the range is around 10 miles, which isn't much compared to our other picks. WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu called the M-E1 “pretty darn close to perfection” in his review (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Folding bikes are great for apartment dwellers, but they're usually tiny. Julian is 6'4\" and looks like a happy clown when he valiantly pedals around on most of them. The M-E1 is full-size and virtually indistinguishable from a non-folding bike. It has solid components from reliable manufacturers, like a Shimano mid-drive motor, a comfortable seat, Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, and all the bells and whistles—integrated lights, fenders, a removable battery, and an easy-to-read display. Most important, Julian says, he can ride it around without dying from embarrassment—always a plus. WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu sees more Lectric bikes around New York City than he can count. That makes sense, since Lectric has some of the most affordable direct-to-consumer folding ebikes around. The latest update, the Lectric XP 3.0 (7/10, WIRED Recommends), offers more of the same—nice suspension; a solid range; thick, fat tires; and a whole suite of solid commuter accessories. It also now has hydraulic brakes, which is a remarkable spec at this price point. However, it's still very heavy and awkward to fold. Chokkattu also says the charging port is difficult to access when the bike is folded up. More important, he's had some quality issues with Lectric bikes (this one had a leaky front tire). However, the price is right. If you live in an apartment where you don't need to carry your bike upstairs, this might be the right pick for you. Note:Lectric issueda voluntary recallfor Lectric XP 3.0 on units sold between November 1, 2022, and May 6, 2023. Affected models are the XP 3.0, the XP 3.0 Long-Range, the XP Step-Thru 3.0, and the XP Step-Thru 3.0 Long-Range. The front and rear mechanical disc brake calipers can fail, which can hurt the rider. If you own one of these models, stop riding immediately andclick hereto file a claim. If balancing upright is yourtop priority, you might want to consider a tricycle. SixThreeZero's bike keeps you in a comfortable, upright position without having to balance on a leg to keep it upright. It has a 250-watt motor with 40 miles on a charge and a top speed of up to 15 mph when you use the throttle. A big rear basket fits a load of groceries or even your puppy. However, it does weigh over 70 pounds and is pretty bulky; you'll need a garage to store it. As our reviewer Stephanie Pearson says, three wheels can be almost as fun as two. ★ Alternative:WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says theLectric Trike ($1,499)(6/10, WIRED Review) is not for anyone living in a walk-up. It's heavy and bulky, and even though it folds, it's difficult to manage. But if you have a garage, it's an affordable way for someone who can't handle a two-wheeler to get out on the road. Trikes have their own set of challenges, but the Lectric has great range, enough power, and strong brakes. Plus it comes with racks, and even a support seat. We've tried alotof bikes over the past few years. So many are great and just did not edge out the ones above for a top spot. Here are the ones that deserve a mention: We love to try new bikes. Unfortunately, the bikes don't always like us. You've seen the bikes around your neighborhood. They look like so much fun! You want one! But ebikes have so many different specs and price points. Here's what I would consider, in your position. Can I build my own bike? Many affordable bikes now come direct-to-consumer—meaning that they are pre-tuned or partially assembled in a box. As Peter Flaxrecently notedinBicyclingmagazine, these bikes do not get nearly the testing or vetting that bikes from a bigger manufacturer get. Unless you're not riding much or for many miles, or are experienced with modifying your own bike, I recommend working with an established manufacturer that has a dealer network. I also do not recommend a smart ebike. As we can see withVanMoof's recent implosion, you may have difficulty getting your smart ebike repaired if the company folds. Why do some bikes cost more? They have higher-end components. Batteries and motors from high-end brands like Bosch and Shimano often are more powerful and cover more distance, with a 90- or 120-mile range, as compared to the 15-20 mile ranges you'll see on more affordable bikes. However, this may not matter if you have a short commute. What terrain do you live on? If you live in a flat area, you're probably fine with a 250-watt motor, which is the European speed standard. However, if you live near hills or haul a lot of stuff, you might want to consider a 500-watt or 750-watt motor and a few extras, like hydraulicdisc brakes, which will help prevent you from skidding into traffic. I would also look for a mid-drive motor instead of a hub-drive motor. Mid-drive motors are located in the center of your bike and feel more natural. A hub drive is on your rear axle and shifts your center of gravity backward, which takes some getting used to. It can throw you off balance when you're going up steep hills. Follow some basic safety tips. Not sure where to start? The biking advocacy group PeopleForBikes recently released their safety education program,E-Bike Smart, which they created in collaboration with the League of American Bicyclists and Bicycle Colorado. Do not leave your bike battery charging overnight, anddo not let your children ride your bikeunsupervised. An 80-pound child should not be piloting a 65-pound bike, even if the motor makes it possible for them to do so.

    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism.Learn more. Please also considersubscribing to WIRED Prime Day is over. We spent weeks prepping for Amazon's semiannual sale and two full days tracking discounts. Now all that's left is watching for packages and moving some money around in your bank accounts. Unless … Yes, there are still a few Prime Day deals ticking. As always, WIRED's picks for the best leftover Prime Day deals include only products someone from our team has personally tested and reviewed. We've linked our reviews and buying guide throughout to help you make fully informed buying decisions. Some of the products on our original list are still discounted, but if the price has increased from yesterday we've removed them. You can shop these deals with confidence that today's price is, in fact, yesterday's price, if not tomorrow's. Also, don't fret if you missed out. Black Friday is just six weeks away. Jump to Category Product Reviewers Scott Gilbertson,Simon Hill,Julian Chokkattu,Ryan Waniata,Louryn Strampe,Parker Hall,Nena Farrell,Adrienne So,Brenda Stolyar,Martin Cizmar,Eric Ravenscraft,Kat Merck,Molly Higgins,Pete Cottell,Lisa Wood Shapiro Our Process We test products year-roundand handpicked these Prime Day deals. Operations manager Scott Gilbertson has covered 15 multiday sale events—including Prime Day and Black Friday—over the past five years, as have many of the members of WIRED's Gear team. We'll update this guide regularly throughout Prime Day by adding fresh deals and removing dead deals. A buck cheaper than it was during Prime Day! Listed in ourBest Routersguide as the best option for folks looking to tryWi-Fi 6E, this hexagonal Asus router performed well in my tests. It is a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band allows for much faster speeds but is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. This router has a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and three gigabit LANs. Asus also provides free security and parental controls and tons of options in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and the list goes on. —Simon Hill RØDE Wireless Go II This set of wireless microphones from Australian audio brand RØDE works well if you’re always filming on the go. You just clip each mic to the lapel of the person you want to record, and it records wirelessly for you to use later. It’s a really simple solution that makes it so you don’t have to mess with traditional (and often annoying) Lavaliermicrophone setupslike you’ve seen on late-night TV. —Parker Hall The Western Digital WD Black SN770 isour favorite bare drive, whether you’re putting it in your laptop or PC or sticking it in an external case to use as a portable drive. The SN 770 is an M.2 2280 drive (check your PC’s specs to see if that fits) and achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you’re doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. —Scott Gilbertson Farrell I'm a big fan of Lifx bulbs for Apple Home users, since the bulbs will be ready for HomeKit setup when you initially unbox them. Not an Apple Home user? No problem—just wait 15 minutes and you can set these bulbs up to work without Apple and can instead link them to Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. Right now I control both my Lifx bulb and my Lifx Beam (7/10, WIRED Recommends) with Google Assistant, and it's just as seamless as using it with Apple. The app is intuitive to navigate and comes with tons of colors and premade scenes you can use, and Lifx doesn't require a hub of any kind to work. They're easy to add onto any smart home, or to use as your exclusive smart home bulb, especially since they're on sale right now. The 800-lumen A19 bulb is on sale, and while it's not as bright as Lifx's higher-lumen bulbs, it's still plenty bright to use in a living room lamp alongside another light. —Nena Farrell The Aura Carver is our top pick for digital photo frames, but right now you can get the upgraded Carver Mat for the same price you’d get the regular model for. The Carver Mat upgrades the 10.1-inch digital photo frame’s look to give it a mat-style frame job, and looks much more than just a $30 upgrade. And right now that $30 extra is gone, thanks to Amazon Prime Day. Aura’s a fantastic brand for digital photo frames thanks to how easy the frames are to set up and manage with the app, letting you easily add photos from your camera roll or Google Photos. You can even scan your kid’s drawings with the Aura app to then display.—Nena Farrell The Abode Lock (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of my favorite smart locks I’ve tested. This retrofit lock is easy to install, fairly quiet, and comes with a keypad and fingerprint reader. It only replaces the back of your deadbolt, making it a good pick for renters or households who want to keep using their existing keys. It doesn’t require a hub, but adding the Abode Hub does give you smart home connectivity. The hub only comes in Abode’s bundles, but you can get theAbode Security Kit for $40 ($120 off) right now. You’ll also want one of Abode’s monthly subscriptions (I did the $7/monthStandard Plan) to get detailed notifications. I know it sounds like a lot, but you’ll be able to build onto this setup as much (or as little!) as you want after getting both the lock and hub for such a good price.—Nena Farrell Jump to a topic:Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals This V15 Detect continues to hold the top spot in our guide toBest Dyson Vacuums. At just under 7 pounds, it’s lightweight, making it easy to maneuver and handle. It also comes equipped with a green laser that shoots out the front of the motorized head, illuminating microscopic dust particles that are typically tough to see. There’s a sensor inside the vacuum as well, which counts the number and determines the size of the particles it’s sucking up—all of which you can see on the LCD. In terms of battery life, you’ll get a 60-minute run time with a battery that takes up to 4.5 hours to fully charge. It’s expensive, but it’s an excellent option if you’re looking for a high-performing stick vacuum.—Brenda Stolyar Dyson’s Ball Animal 3 vacuum(9/10, WIRED Recommends) is great for unruly pet hair. It has more bin capacity than the previous version and comes with a Motorbar cleaner head with detangling hair-removal vanes. It has three different power modes to choose from: one for deep- and medium-pile carpets, another for low-pile carpets and large debris, and one for ground-in dirt and hardwood floors. It’s easy to maneuver, especially around awkward spaces and tight corners, and the bin never clogs up with fur. It is heavy and loud, though. But aside from that, it’s an excellent corded vacuum for pet owners.—Brenda Stolyar The Matrix is the newest version of the Shark AI Ultra, the 2-in-1 mopping vacuum that earned a“Most Improved Award”from me in 2022. Like most companies that purport to offer maximum value for minimum price, Shark has products that can be hit or miss. Happily, however, the Matrix is one of the hits, as I found it to be a reliable cleaning companion with quick and accurate mapping, multifunctional mopping, and vacuuming. It doesn’t need replacement dust bags—which is both a blessing and a curse, as the self-emptying dustbin sometimes doesn’t empty quite all the way.—Adrienne So When I included the rocket-shaped Shark NeverChange Air Purifier Max in WIRED’s lineup of theBest Air Purifiers of 2024,I recommended it as the ideal gift for your dorm-bound loved ones. Standing just under 2 feet tall, the NeverChange can be placed as close as 3 inches from a wall, making it a good fit for crowded spaces. The average American dorm room is around 230 square feet, and the Shark NeverChange succeeds at exchanging the air the five recommended times per hour—perfect for a multiple-person dorm room. One caveat: To achieve that level of air purification, the NeverChange must be at itshighest setting, which is to say its loudest setting. The NeverChange HEPA filter captures fine particles along with an activated carbon filter to trap odors and gases. It also includes Shark’s own “Odor Neutralizer Technology,” a small cartridge filled with an “Ocean Breeze” fragrance pod that looks like solid perfume. I would skip this, as I didn’t care for the scent.—Lisa Wood Shapiro This is our top pick in ourBest Pillowsguide, and it’s not hard—in fact, it’s rather soft and squishy—to see why. I live in Texas, where it’s summer nine months out of the year, and this pillow still manages to stay cool throughout the night. It features a multilayer structure with a sturdy foam core to keep its shape, flanked by softer memory core layers to cushion your head. No matter how many pillows I test, I keep finding myself reaching for this one when I need a really good nap.—Eric Ravenscraft This is one of thebest indoor security camerasyou can buy because it’s capable of recognizing faces, so it can tell you when your kids come home. I also like the understated style. With HDR, the 1080p video quality is clear at 30 fps, with automatic night vision when it’s dark. There’s also decent two-way audio, and enforced two-factor authentication, which is important for an indoor camera. The big downside is that you need a Nest Aware subscription costing $8 per month ($80/year) for 30 days of event video history and familiar face alerts, but that does cover all your Nest devices. —Simon Hill The perfectoutdoor security camerafor Google households, Nest Cam Outdoor has a handy magnetic mount that makes it easy to angle the camera. It has an expansive 130-degree field of view, captures sharp 1080p video with HDR and night vision, and boasts a clear speaker and microphone. You only get three hours of free event history, but you can add a Nest Aware subscription ($8 a month, or $80 for the whole year) to get 30 days of event history and face recognition, which is super handy. —Simon Hill Purina's Petivity (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a more affordable way to monitor your cat's health without having to fork over $700 for an automatic litter box. The Petivity sits underneath a standardlitter boxand, once connected to the app, tells you which cat visited the box at what time, how much they weigh, and if they went number one or two. This tool is perfect for the helicopter pet parent, so you can track any differences in their litter box usage and if something seems off, take them to the vet before the issue becomes bigger and more costly. Right now the Petivity is the lowest price we’ve seen for an expensive pet health monitoring tool—less than half of what it usually costs.—Molly Higgins A good drill isessential for your home tool kit, and this is the best one we’ve tested. It’s got more than enough torque for most tasks—and ’tis better to have more torque and not need it than to need it and not have it. The bundle includes two batteries and a charger, and the chuck will accept every bit you’ll end up using. The included batteries can be swapped with other DeWalt power tools as well. —Louryn Strampe The Nuzzie Ice Knit weighted blanket is one of mytop weighted blanket picks, and a great alternative to the popular Bearaby Tree Napper if you want something extra soft or have a specific weight you’re looking for. It’s a similar open-knit design, and both use weighted fabric as filler rather than beads, but the Nuzzie uses bamboo material to give it a silkier, cooling touch. It has different weight options than the Bearaby Tree—the Nuzzie comes in 12, 16, 22, and 28 pounds—and I personally found those offerings closer to 10% of my weight. I just had a friend come over and they immediately commented on how nice the Nuzzie was to sit under while watching a movie. —Nena Farrell Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals Cookie season is just around the corner. Weswear bythese baking sheets from Nordic Ware. They’ve lasted our reviewer over a decade so far, with zero warps or other issues. Right now you can literally get two for the price of one, so if you’re baking on secondhand sheets that just aren’t cutting it, it’s a good time to invest in this upgrade. —Louryn Strampe In a world where appliances are constantly vying for countertop space, the Ninja Max XL has a nice compact footprint that should make it fit in neatly with whatever else is currently residing there. It boasts a few different settings including roasting, baking, and crisping—so whether you’re whipping up some curly fries or you’re crafting a birthday cake, this gadget can still be useful. Read more about it in ourair fryer buying guide. —Louryn Strampe This little gadget is one ofour favorite air fryers, partially because it’s actually not so little. The 6-quart capacity can make up to six servings of food at once, so it’s great for larger households. You’ll get six cooking modes, including fry, roast, broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. The best part is the large viewing window, which lets you check the progress of your food without having to drop the internal temperature. The air fryer has a wide temperature range, and there are built-in filters that help cut down on any odors. Though I, for one, wouldn’t be mad if my kitchen smelled likesteak bitesall the time. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals Breville Barista Express Our top pick in ourBest Espresso Machines guide, this is the machine to buy if you’re looking for a step up from a Keurig. I have been using mine since 2018 and it has served me well for more than six years. It’s quick to turn on, has a built-in grinder, a tamper that stores magnetically, and there’s a steam wand that can froth milk for a latte, though it takes a while. —Julian Chokkattu The Barista Express Impress (6/10, WIRED Review) is a more feature-rich version ofour favorite espresso machineabove. It has more grind and dosage settings, and it automates some of the more complex parts of brewing espresso, such as getting just the right amount of grounds per shot. Otherwise, it’s largely the same. It’s got a built-in grinder, an adjustable steam wand, and a sturdy construction. We see this deal on a regular basis, but the discount is still good. —Louryn Strampe This very fancily namedespresso machinemade our list of the very best. It’s a two-in-one machine with a built-in grinder and a slim form factor compared to similar machines. It has a couple of quirks—like the stepstool for your mug to prevent splashing—but overall it’s a joy to use and if you’re spending money like crazy on artisan coffee drinks at your local shop, the investment will pay off. We’ve seen it drop as low as $500 before, but it rarely drops below $550, so we still think this is a decent deal. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals Even though we don’t consider the 9th Gen iPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) the best for most people—mainly because it’s three years old and packs an older, A13 Bionic chip—it’s still a solid option if you’re in the market for a budget tablet. It’s affordable and comes with a ton of great features like a physical Touch ID-enabled home button, 64 GB of storage on the base model, a 12-megapixel rear camera (with support for Center Stage), and a True Tone display. It’s also compatible with accessories like the 1st Gen Apple Pencil and Apple’s Smart Keyboard.—Brenda Stolyar This is thelatest iPad Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It now comes in two sizes: 11 inches and 13 inches. The latter is bigger and brighter, making it excellent to use as a secondary display to work off of or watch TV on. It also comes equipped with an M2 processor (the same one that powers the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro from 2022) that delivers smooth performance even with multiple apps running simultaneously. Apple also moved the front-facing 12-megapixel camera to landscape orientation. As with the previous version, it also has a USB-C port, slim bezels, and Touch ID built into the top power button.—Brenda Stolyar The iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite tablet to travel with. The 8.3-inch display is great for watching movies, sketching, notetaking, and reading ebooks. It also has Touch ID built into the power button, a front-facing camera with Center Stage, and an A15 Bionic processor (as seen on the iPhone 13) that can handle taxing apps or games. It’s worth noting this model came out in 2021, and Apple is expected to announce the next-generation version either in November or early 2025. I recommend waiting if you can.—Brenda Stolyar Apple iPad (10th Generation) The iPad (10th Gen)(7/10, WIRED Review)is our favorite iPad for most people. It comes with a large 10.9-inch Liquid Retina (IPS LCD) display, a touch ID sensor integrated into the power button, a USB-C port instead of Lightning, and a 12-megapixel rear camera (an upgrade from the eight megapixels). The 12-MP selfie camera has also been moved to the center of the iPad, so you’ll no longer have to awkwardly stare to the side during video calls. Under the hood is also an A14 Bionic chip, which delivers slightly faster performance and a bump in graphics over its predecessor.—Brenda Stolyar This is the latest and more feature-packed Apple Pencil. It comes with a few noteworthy features including a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (but you can still use double-tap) along with a haptic engine inside that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. There’s a built-in gyroscope sensor too, which allows you to change the orientation of the tools as you twist it for finer control. It also comes with support for Apple’s Find My Network in case you lose it. It’s worth noting, however, thatit only workswith theiPad Air (M2)andiPad Pro (M4). —Brenda Stolyar MacBook Air 13-Inch Laptop Although M4-powered MacBooks are imminent, the MacBook Pro with M3 launched just a year ago—so it’s still an excellent choice. It packs a brighter display with mini LED and a 120-Hz refresh rate, along with a 1080p webcam. It packs plenty of ports too, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, a high-impedance headphone jack, and an SD card slot. We recommend it if you’re looking for a MacBook Pro without spending $2,000 or more. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals Thebest smartwatchfor Samsung fans, the Galaxy Watch7 is a very nice companion for a Galaxy phone. It is packed with features, offers notifications from your phone, and allows you to control your smart home from your wrist. It even boasts artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data. But the battery life could be better and it doesn't add much over the much cheaper, older Watch6. —Simon Hill Discounts on Oura’s biohacking smart rings are rare, but the Oura Ring Gen3 Horizon (6/10, WIRED Review) is currently on sale for Prime Day (no doubt because theOura Ring 4 is about to land). This smart ring isour favorite sleep trackerand does a solid job of tracking your activity and stress levels. It packs three hospital-grade sensors: infrared photoplethysmography sensors for heart rate and respiration, a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) sensor for body temperature, and a 3D accelerometer for movement. The app is easy to use, but you must factor in Oura’s $6-per-month membership, which is essential to get the most from this gadget.—Simon Hill Withings ScanWatch 2 If you prefer a traditional analog-looking watch but want some of the features of a smartwatch, then the Withings ScanWatch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) would like a word. With a classy design, comprehensive health and sleep tracking, and long battery life, this is one of thebest smartwatchesyou can buy. It tracks your temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels, and has an ECG feature. The screen is tiny, so you can’t do much on it, but you can get notifications from your phone ticker-tape-style if you want. —Simon Hill Mobvoi’s Ticwatch smartwatches have long been a bit bland but they also deliver some of the best battery life on a feature-rich smartwatch. That’s because they use two kinds of displays, one low-power screen for when you’re not staring at the watch, and then an OLED for when you’re interacting with it. This watch performs well and lasts four days on a charge, but Mobvoi has a spotty record when it comes to software updates, so just know that you may not get the latest Wear OS features for months, if not a year. —Julian Chokkattu OnePlus’s first Wear OS watch is excellent (7/10, WIRED Recommends). Similar to the Ticwatch, it employs a hybrid architecture running two operating systems and two processors—one handles all the graphics-intensive Wear OS tasks, and the other sips on power for mundane step tracking and the like. I got three days of juice on a single charge, though you can stretch this if you optimize the watch and conserve power. It’s not as well-rounded in the health and fitness tracking department, but it’s adept at controlling smart home devices, notifications, and music playback. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals Samsung 65-inch S95D LG’s C-series OLED models are consistently among our favorite TVs of the year. The C3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is another stunner thanks to its perfect black levels and nearly infinite contrast, bright and naturalistic colors, and excellent clarity and detail. As a 2023 model, the C3 isn’t quite as bright as the current version, but it’s still well worth grabbing on a good sale. Along with its fabulous picture quality, the TV provides four HDMI 2.1 ports for high-end gaming features on any input, a snappy (if a bit stodgy) webOS interface, and a stylish and refined aesthetic. You’ll want to check out the C4’s sale price too, but I wouldn’t hesitate to pick up the C3 on clearance. In fact, that’s exactly what I did when I purchased my year-old LG C1 a few years back, and I haven’t regretted that decision for a second.—Ryan Waniata We like TCL Q Class TVs though we prefer the Q6 which we have namedBest TV overall. But this is a nice savings on a 55-inch one step down.—Martin Cizmar LG’s C4 OLED is one of the prettiest TVs I have ever seen (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It has perfect contrast, a great interface, and a 144hz refresh rate that makes it great even for PC gaming. It’s an OLED TV that is finally bright enough to watch in rooms with lights on, and it supports Dolby Vision high dynamic range, which comparable Samsung models do not. If you’ve been in the market for a high-end TV, this deal makes now a good time to buy.—Parker Hall Hisense’s middle-tier min LED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic value, especially at this price which is the lowest we’ve seen all year. Those after sparkling brightness matched by excellent contrast will find this TV delivers, thanks to rich and deep black levels with very little blooming. You’ll also get expansive quantum dot colors and great gaming features like a dedicated gaming mode and VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) in 4K at up to 144 Hz thanks to HDMI 2.1 support across two of its four HDMI ports. It finishes things off with an inviting Google TV interface for an excellent all-around experience. At this price, it’s honestly hard to go wrong, which is why it’s currently our pick as the best TV for most people.—Ryan Waniata Samsung’s S95DQD-OLED, the third model in the company’s return to OLED displays, is a different animal than its predecessors. It’s the first to offer a new matte screen that reduces direct and indirect reflections with impressive efficacy. That makes it great for those with sunny rooms or lots of reflective lighting, though it can create a slight loss in perceived picture depth for dark content in bright lighting. Still, as one of thebrightest OLED TVsyou can buy, it absolutely sizzles with HDR content day or night, while its excellent picture processing and quantum dot colors burst to life in everything you watch. It’s loaded with extras, including support for the top gaming features across all inputs, but like all Samsung TVs, it doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR. This won’t be the perfect fit for everyone, but if you’re after phenomenal OLED performance that keeps reflections at bay, the S95D is a great buy—especially on sale.—Ryan Waniata Hisense’s 65-inch U8N (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the brightest TVs I’ve ever seen, with only the masterfulBravia 9matching its wattage in our test pile so far. This baby will blow the doors off your last TV, but just as important as those blistering highlights are its fantastic black levels and rich colors for well-rounded spectacle inHDRand even dimmer SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) content. It matches its punchy picture with top-tier gaming features, a solid Google TV interface that’s easy to setup and use, and some features you might not expect like an adjustable optical audio port that automatically lets you control the volume of older audio systems with your TV remote. If you’re after thebest TVexperience you can get for under $1,000, the U8N drops the hammer.—Ryan Waniata Sony’s all-in-one Quad home theater system (8/10, WIRED Recommends) provides the best surround sound immersion I’ve heard in a single-box solution. Even more intriguing, the four fabric-lined cubes and small control box are brilliantly discreet, mounting to the wall and requiring only power outlets and a single HDMI connetion to your TV. That makes the setup great for those who want to bring the theater experience home without all the clutter. You’ll likely want to add one ofSony’s wireless subwoofersso the end cost is certainly steep, but this price drop makes the Quad seriously enticing for those after a stealthy setup that brings the goods. —Ryan Waniata Of the many, many options in theRoku lineup, Roku Ultra is the fanciest. It has the strongest dual-band Wi-Fi you can get in a Roku, plus an Ethernet port if you prefer wireless connections. We don’t really think that’s necessary, but if you care, the option is there. The remote has an option for hands-free voice controls as well as a headphone jack. Roku even throws a free pair of earbuds in, and they’re surprisingly decent—and you won’t wake up your sleeping partner while you binge the newest season ofWhat We Do in the Shadows. Another neat feature is that if you have hands-free voice controls turned on, you can speak into the void and ask your remote to beep. We truly live in the future. —Louryn Strampe The Roku Express 4K+ is similar to the one we recommendin our guide. The main difference is that this slightly cheaper model doesn’t have a Voice Remote Pro, therefore it doesn’t have a headphone jack. If you don’t care about using voice controls or listening to your TV via headphones but want a capable streaming stick with loads of free channels and a dead-simple interface, this is a good model to get to save some cash. We’ve seen this drop to $25 before, but $27 is still a good deal since it usually bounces between that and $40. —Louryn Strampe Roku’s simple and easy-to-use interface is probably my favorite in all of streaming TV land. It has virtually every app you can fathom, excellent voice search, and pumps out surprisingly great video quality from a device the size of a gum packet. I’d still go for a higher-end streamer for my main TV, but if you have an older screen that needs a streaming upgrade or has an interface you hate, this is one of ourfavorite streaming devices. —Parker Hall If you don’t have a 4K TV, you don’t need to pay extra for a 4K streaming stick. The Roku Express is the cheapest in the lineup, but it’sperfectly capable. It’s a bare-bones device that doesn’t have any fancy extra features like voice or TV controls, but you’ll still get the beloved Roku interface and access to all of your usual streaming networks. Lots of other Roku devices are on sale for Prime Day, though, so if you plan on upgrading your TV over the next few years, it might be worthwhile to just spend the extra cash on amore future-proof devicenow. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals This is the first major discount we're seeing on Microsoft's latest Surface Laptop (which is alsoa Copilot+ PC, which we explain in this story). It's a perfectly fine machine (7/10, WIRED Recommends) but was too expensive out of the gate. This price is a little more reasonable, especially since this is the version with the Snapdragon X Elite chipset, 16 GB of RAM, and a 1-terabyte solid state drive. You also get a 14-inch touchscreen with a120-Hz screen refresh rate. Performance is great for everyday tasks with good battery life, just take a grain of salt with all the “AI” features. Also remember that since this is a Qualcomm-powered PC, there may be some app compatibility issues.—Julian Chokkattu Gaming on a Chromebook? It's not something you immediately think of on these machines that revolve around the Google Chrome browser. Still, the 516 GE (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the more powerful Chromebook Plus laptops out there with battery life that will get you through a workday just fine. It's billed as a cloud gaming machine, allowing you to stream games through services likeXbox Cloud Gaming or Nvidia GeForce Now. There's Wi-Fi 6E support or an Ethernet port to maximize internet speeds. Plus you get a 16-inch screen with a 120-Hz refresh rate.—Julian Chokkattu Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals The Ray (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is an intriguing offering from Sonos, a brand that’s helped redefine the soundbar landscape. It doesn’t connect over HDMI ARC like most modern soundbars, using an optical input instead. That means it’s tougher to control it with your TV remote, though it’s programmable for many modern TVs which is important since it oddly doesn’t come with its own remote. The tradeoff is advanced networking features like Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay 2, and the ability to connect with other Sonos speakers for a whole-home audio system. Most important, this compact bar sounds very good for its size, with more bass and overall punch than you’d believe when you unpack it. The Ray isn’t for everyone, but if it fits your needs, it's a hot attraction at a cool price.—Ryan Waniata The Sonos Beam Gen 2 sits in the middle of the company’s current lineup, offering a balanced blend of sound quality and features. It’s not particularly punchy in the bass, but its compact size serves up clear dialogue and surprisingly expansive effects sound thanks to acoustic trickery that includes virtual Dolby Atmos support. Like other Sonos speakers, it offers advanced networking features, including a variety of supported streaming services, AirPlay 2, and the ability to connect to other Sonos speakers over Wi-Fi for a multi-room or surround sound setup. Its minimalist design disappears on your console, and the HDMI ARC connection makes it simple to control with your TV remote. Those who want bigger sound may want to step up to the Arc, but the Beam is a solid compact system with loads of features. —Ryan Waniata Dolby Atmos Soundbar systems are frowned upon by the nerds on Reddit, but I actually have found that recent generations do compete pretty well with traditional receiver-and-speakers setups. This one from LG is usually a bit expensive for most buyers, but at under a thousand bucks for a setup with two rear surround speakers with upfiring drivers and a wireless subwoofer, it’s hard to argue with this deal. It even has Dolby Vision and 120hz 4K passthrough, which means you can connect your latest consoles and not worry that it’s throttling the video. —Parker Hall Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) helped change how we think about soundbars. At nearly $900 list, its lack of extras like a subwoofer or surround speakers seemed like a serious hindrance. Instead, the tubular device proved that a single bar is all you need for thrilling home theater audio, with solid bass response and powerful speakers that bounce sound all around your room. Its Dolby Atmos height speakers are particularly impressive, submerging you in sound with supported content. Of course, if you want more, the Arc happily obliges by connecting wirelessly with other Sonos speakers in a multiroom audio system, or a full 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos setup. It’s got plenty of other features, including a built-in microphone for smart commands and the ability to stream over Wi-Fi from multiple services. It doesn’t offer Bluetooth or even a spare HDMI input, but if you’re looking for a topline, all-in-one sound system, it’s one of thebest soundbarsout there.—Ryan Waniata Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals Many of us thought the AirPods Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends) was getting a refresh at the most recent Apple event, but all we got was a USB-C version fit for European consumption. That means this discounted model is still Apple’s top of the pops, and indeed it still stands tall in the noise-canceling headphones lexicon. You’ll get a solid aluminum design that feels posh, great sound, good noise canceling, and transparency mode that brings in the world around you in and incredibly natural way. You’ll also get good Apple-centric features like the ability to seamlessly swap between iCloud devices These headphones are rather heavy and don’t come with a travel case, but otherwise they’re still an excellent buy, especially now that the price has crept down drastically from their original $600 MSRP.—Ryan Waniata The Beats Studio Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are a super solid pair of headphones that cost just a bit too much at full price for them to rise to my exclusive list of top favorites. That’s why they’re so enticing on a great sale. These headphones offer excellent audio performance and noise canceling, natural sounding transparency mode, some good Apple-centric features (since Apple owns the Beats brand), and even trendy tricks like 360 audio with head tracking that puts you in the center of your sound. I wish they had auto-pause, something I expect in a pair of top-tier headphones, and the build is less premium than other headphones in their class but at this price, they’re nothing less than a killer deal.—Ryan Waniata These are our favoriteAirPods alternatives. They have noise cancellation, support for spatial audio, and transparency mode. Although they aren’t the most comfortable earbuds we’ve tested, they’re very easy to use, thanks to the physical buttons on the outside of each earbud. We also like that they’re super stylish and come in colors like ivory, silver, black, and transparent. —Brenda Stolyar The Beats Fit Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is best for the gym, due to its ergonomic design. They have squishy fins for better stability, soft silicone tips, and a fit test to make sure the buds sit properly in your ears. The outside of each bud also has a clicky button used for controls. In terms of sound, they also deliver a detailed and punch sound signature, excellent noise cancelation, and reliable microphones for calls. —Brenda Stolyar Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are the brand’s top wireless pair, offering excellent noise canceling, great sound, and tons of advanced features. Even with a couple of years under their belt, the XM5 do well to fend off fresh rivals like theSonos Ace. They can’t match theBose Ultrawhen it comes to noise canceling, but I generally prefer their sound quality, especially after taming their taut bass with Sony’s multi-band EQ. There’s not a major feature the XM5 don’t offer, from auto pausing when you speak to letting in the world around you with a cupped hand on the right earcup. Perhaps their best feature is usability, with everything from their touch controls to their app working flawlessly. Their 30 hours of battery life is enough for even trips off the grid. Their only real knock is a longer travel case than their predecessor, theWH-1000XM4that’s harder to pack. The XM5 are among thebest wireless headphonesout there, and they’re all the more tempting on a good sale.—Ryan Waniata With so much marketing hype in consumer electronics, it’s nice to seea product that lives up to its name. When Bose says “Ultra” in this case, the company means it. You won’t find a pair of earbuds with noise canceling this powerful or comprehensive anywhere on the market right now. Others may come close, but when it comes to strangling as much of the ambient audio around you as possible, these buds stand alone. They add to their cancellation prowess with clear and vibrant sound performance, solid battery life, and extras like adaptive transparency mode to keep sudden loud noises at bay and 3D audio with head tracking to immerse you in your tunes and videos. If you’ve been waiting for a good sale on the ultimate noise cancellers, now is your moment. –Ryan Waniata Sony’s WF-1000XM5 (7/10 WIRED Recommends) are every bit a flagship pair of Sony earbuds. They don’t have the best noise canceling or arguably even the best sound for the money, but their mix of top-tier versions of each alongside a wide suite of useful features and technologies makes them an excellent sonic companion even at their high price. Their design is more compact and ergonomic than many competitors, fitting nimbly in your pocket and your ears. Their touch controls are simple to use, and their 8 hours of battery life per charge (and multiple case recharges) is among the best in class. It all adds up to a well-rounded package that’s especially tempting on sale.—Ryan Waniata This comes with the major caveat that Shokz recently released the update to these longtime favorite headphones, theOpenRun Pro 2, which have, among other things, USB-C charging so you’re not constantly looking for Shokz’s proprietary charger. However, the older version is still great—it’s smaller, the battery life is slightly better, and the sound quality is also just a tiny bit better. There’s alsoa mini versionfor those of us with tiny, tiny necks.—Adrienne So Sony Linkbuds S Sony’s Linkbuds S don’t seem to have much in common with their namesake, the original Linkbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The latter have a hole in the middle to eternally let in the outside world, while the Linkbuds S are more like traditional earbuds, offering both transparency mode and noise canceling, allowing you to let in or suppress environmental sounds respectively. This makes them more of a philosophical follow-up, but they’re still a solid pair of midrange earbuds. Their best feature may be their minuscule size, making them comfy and easy to wear for hours at a time. You’ll also get plenty of features, including a multi-band EQ and a speak-to-chat feature that pauses sound when you talk. It’s a good package, especially at their reduced price, making these a worthy buy for those after Sony quality without shelling out for a flagship pair.—Ryan Waniata If you’re gettingheadphones for your kidsyou should always make sure they are volume-limited to ensure they don’t damage their hearing. This pair from Altec Lansing are limited to 85 decibels but also have active noise cancellation to block out background noise. They come in various fun color combos, are wireless, and work for up to 15 hours when fully charged. My kids tested these and my wife uses them at school (she’s a teacher) and the students find them comfy. They also score an IPX4 rating and wipe clean easily. —Simon Hill Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals Speakers this cute—and cheap!—sound like a recipe for poor performance. Luckily, Creative's pint-sized Pebble V3 speakers can deliver great sound quality for all my gaming and meeting needs. Midrange and bass notes come through nicely, and there's a single gain switch you can flip on too. The speakers connect via USB-C, Bluetooth, or the included 3.5-mm audio cable. All three work great, but the audio cable is my favorite for switching back and forth between my work laptop and gaming computer. Want a subwoofer? Creative also has thePebble Plus 2.1 set on sale for $37which adds a little subwoofer to pump up your sound with the two adorable Pebble speakers. —Nena Farrell Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals The PlayStation 5 Slim is the new smaller version of the popular Sony console. You can read aboutthe differences here. You may want to save for thePS5 Pro coming next month.—Martin Cizmar The Corsair K65 Plus isone of our favorite keyboards, especially if you want to take it on the go. The 75 percent layout keeps the dedicated arrow keys, but cuts off most of the other less-than-necessary keys to help keep it low-profile. It has a stylish volume knob, and connects via Bluetooth, USB-C, or a wireless dongle that you can store in the keyboard itself.—Eric Ravenscraft If you’re looking for an upgrade over the typical Xbox controllers, the Scuf Instinct Pro isour top choice. It has a comfortably grippy matte black finish and a stylish color palette. On the rear, there are four hair-trigger paddles that can be mapped to any button, making it easier to juggle abilities in complex, fast-paced games likeOverwatch 2orDestiny 2.—Eric Ravenscraft Samsung Odyssey G6 OLED Gaming Monitor There’s a lot to love about the Samsung Odyssey G6 (8/10, WIRED Recommends), from its gorgeous OLED panel to its highly accurate DCI-P3 color coverage. But the one feature that stood out to me when I reviewed it was the absolutely ludicrous 360Hz refresh rate. That’s so many frames per second that it effectively ensures your monitor will never be the bottleneck on the road to smooth gameplay.—Eric Ravenscraft Popular with Twitch streamers, this translucent purple deck offers a console of 15 buttons you can program to get things done. We haveElgato Stream Deck tipsif you need ideas about what and how to automate. The faceplate is swappable and there’s a detachable stand. Also on sale, theElgato Stream Deck Plus ($170)switches some buttons for dials. Both are at all-time lows. —Simon Hill Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals With an irresistible cute wee robot face that doubles as a display for charging stats, this is one ofour favorite power banks. It is also a zippy performer with a USB-C port that can deliver up to 100 watts and boasts support for just about every fast charging protocol under the sun. There is also a USB-A that’s good for up to 15 watts. The 12,000 mAh capacity is enough to charge most phones at least twice. —Simon Hill Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals I freaking love thishumble little electric pizza oven, which has zero pretensions but is one of the most versatile additions to my outdoor kitchen. The “woodfire” in the name is a bit of a stretch, given that it just has a tiny trapdoor with which to add pellets to give a smoky flavor to your food. But it’s so easy to use that over the past year, I’ve ended up using it every day. Just punch in what style of pizza you want, let it preheat, and pop it in. I’ve also used it to make muffins, ribs, and macaroni and cheese.—Adrienne So Segway Ninebot E2 Plus The E2 Plus is a 32-pound electric scooter with a range of roughly 10 miles. (I tested it as a 6’4” man—most people will be able to go a little farther.) It’s easy to fold up and carry around, and the 15-mph top speed is beginner-friendly. Don’t expect it to go up steep hills with the 300-watt motor, but it’s a great affordable scooter for grocery runs or quick trips to the deli. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a topic:Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Tech Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Coffee Deals,Best Apple Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals,Best TV Deals,Best Laptop and Tablet Deals,Best Soundbar Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Gaming Deals,Best Charging Deals,Best Outdoor Deals,Best Camera Deals Sony Alpha 7R V Our top pick formax megapixels, Sony’s flagship full-frame mirrorless camera features a 61-megapixel full-frame sensor, which is largely unmatched in its class (if you want more megapixels you’ll need to get a medium-format camera). If that’s not enough, there’s a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding and the autofocus is plenty snappy. —Scott Gilbertson We think this is the best mirrorless camera for most people. Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and the best autofocus system on the market. It's compact and light enough to carry all day without back strain, and the grip is comfortable. The five-axis image stabilization means you can hand-hold it in lower light, and the wide range of 4K video options makes it the best all-around video-and-stills combo on the market. —Scott Gilbertson The newHero 13 Blackbrings interchangeable lenses and other features, but last year's Hero 12 Black (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a great camera, especially at this price. It'sour favorite GoPro on sale, and on sale it is. For $300 you'd be hard-pressed to get a better action camera. There's good, smart stabilization, support for Log video, wireless mic support, and a tripod mount. The one downside is there's no GPS support in the Hero 12 (that's good for battery life, but if you liked GPS, this is not the camera to get). —Scott Gilbertson This isn't a huge deal, but we rarely see Fujifilm's nicer Instax cameras go on sale. We think this isthe best camera that uses the square Instax film. The SQ40 is about as simple as it gets, twist the lens barrel to turn it on, frame your shot, hit the shutter button, and voilà out comes your image, which develops in about 90 seconds. There’s a film counter near the bottom left side of the back to let you know how many images you have left. The only other option is a selfie mode, designed for close-ups.

    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more. You probably shelledout good money fora nice big TVand maybe a streaming gadget. But it doesn’t matter how large your screen is or how much it cost—the speakers in your TV almost definitely sound awful. You’d be surprised how much more you'll enjoy shows and movies with a halfway decent soundbar or surround system hooked up to your primo panel. Explosions pop, dialog sounds far crisper, and you may even notice sonic details in your favorite films that you’ve never picked up on before. There are seemingly a million options, but we've put the time and effort into testing dozens of soundbars over the past few years to help you find the best soundbar at varying budgets. Need more help? We have a guide onhow to find the perfect soundbar, with definitions of many of the terms you'll come across while shopping. Be sure to read ourBest TVs,Best Speakers, andBest Streaming Devicesguides for more ways toupgrade your home theater. Updated October 2024: We’ve added the Sony Bravia Theater Quad, the Vizio 5.1 SE, and updated copy to keep pace with the latest developments. Special offer for Gear readers:GetWIREDfor just $5 ($25 off). This includes unlimited access toWIRED.com, full Gear coverage, and subscriber-only newsletters. Subscriptions help fund the work we do every day. This soundbar is small and light enough to be easily taken from room to room (in case your gaming happens in a different space than your cinema viewing), affordable enough to accompany even the most modestly priced TVs, and more than capable of trouncing the sound your television alone makes. The 100-watt output powers two forward-facing full-range drivers and an upward-firing bass driver, and there are a couple of passive bass radiators on board for good measure. The result is a sound that’s far broader and deeper than the SR-C20A itself, striking a great balance between detail, refinement, and attack. This Yamaha is unobtrusive, but only in the physical sense.—Simon Lucas Inputs: HDMI ARC, optical, 3.5 mm, Bluetooth. ★ Dolby Atmos upgrade:Looking for something with a bit more punch and immersion? Try theTrue X Bar 50A(8/10, WIRED Recommends), which adds a subwoofer and upfiring speakers to provide a height element forDolby AtmosTV shows and movies, pulling you further into the action. Klipsch's Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds way better than it should for the money. Klipsch cut a few corners to lower the cost, namely Wi-Fi support, which leaves out streaming options like AirPlay and Spotify Connect and smart assistants like Alexa. In their place, you'll get notably clear sound, up-firing drivers to provide overhead sound effects with Dolby Atmos content, and surprising gravitas up and down the frequency spectrum for a stand-alone bar. The Flexus lives up to its name with impressive versatility, including the ability to add wireless surround speakers, a wireless subwoofer, or even a third-party sub via a traditional sub output. You'll also get an app for adjusting audio settings, a handy remote, and most importantly, the satisfaction of knowing you scored great sound for far less than many competitors.—Ryan Waniata Inputs: HDMI eARC, optical, USB-C, Bluetooth (subwoofer output) If you or someone you love has a hard time hearing what the voices onscreen are saying, consider this awesome little soundbar from lesser-known (but long-standing) brand Zvox. The company has perfected what it calls “AccuVoice” technology, which uses digital signal processing to make voices sound clearer. It does this better than any soundbar I’ve tested with a similar feature. Inputs: Optical, 3.5 mm (requires its own remote). Samsung's multi-speaker flagship bar has been our favorite Dolby Atmos distributor for multiple iterations. The previous model, theHW-Q990B, was the best we'd ever heard at filling a room with expansive, impactful, and musical sound. The HW-Q990C offers modest improvements, including an upgraded subwoofer for tighter bass response alongside previous extras like the ability to connect wirelessly to select Samsung TVs. This is a pricey system with a more onerous setup than single-piece soundbars, but it's easy to use and offers the best immersion and musicality of any traditional soundbar system I've tested. Samsung has updated this model to theQ990D, which includes upgrades like HDMI 2.1 passthrough for connecting gaming consoles directly. We'll be testing that setup soon, but if you're not connecting gaming systems, I still like the cheaper QN990C while available.—Ryan Waniata Inputs: Three HDMI ports (one for eARC), optical, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Alexa. ★ Also great:LG's S95TR9.1.5-channel soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) doesn't perform as well as Samsung's flagship bar, but it could be a better choice for those with newerLG TVs like the C4, which can connect wirelessly and use its speakers in tandem with the bar for more immersion. It also supports gaming features like 120Hz passthrough, but only includes one spare input. If you’re into console gaming, you know how important it is to detect that opponent creeping behind you in the shadows. This affordable Dolby Atmos soundbar from Vizio (9/10, WIRED Recommends) helps you hear every footstep in real, physical space. Atmos bars fire sound upward, expanding your TV’s soundstage. This means gamers can hear what’s going on above them and have a better shot at avoiding that gun-toting helicopter flying overhead. Two upward-firing rear surround speakers also come in the box. For under $500, it’s one of the most affordable Atmos-enabled soundbar bundles you’ll find with surround speakers, making it a no-brainer for anyone who values fantastic sound. Inputs: Two HDMI ports (one for ARC), 3.5 mm, optical, USB, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. Sonos' second-generation Beam doesn’t look much different from the first generation, but the sonic upgrade is immense. You get immersive Dolby Atmos interpretation thanks to Sonos’ superb onboard audio processing. The bar pairs with both Alexa and Google Assistant so you can do everything from setting alarms to asking it the weather. Sonos connectivity also means you can use it as part of a multiroom audio system, where it is compatible with every major streaming service. If you want to expand your system, you can addother Sonos speakersas surrounds, and aSonos-made subwooferfor bass down the line. Check out ourBest Sonos Speakersguide for other options. Inputs: HDMI eARC, Ethernet, IR receiver for TV remote, Wi-Fi. ★ Better immersion:TheBose Smart Soundbar 600is a great alternative to the Beam, offering true upfiring drivers for more convincing Dolby Atmos effects, alongside surprisingly fun and musical sound. It's only got Alexa built in, but if that's your go-to smart assistant, the 600 is another pint-sized smart bar worth considering. Vizio soundbars have long been known to bend the basic rules of performance for your dollars, and the 5.1 Soundbar SE (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest to personify this reputation. At just around $200, you're getting slick surround sound performance and impressive virtualized Dolby Atmos and DTS:X immersion in a compact bar-and-subwoofer package. The system isn't the best for music (you'd be better off with somebookshelf speakers), and there's no optical input for older TVs. Otherwise, the only real downside is the wired speakers that plug into the subwoofer, limiting placement options. That's a small concession for true surround sound at this meager price, making the Vizio 5.1 SE a great option for movie nuts on a very tight budget.—Ryan Waniata Inputs: HDMI eARC, Bluetooth. Sony's HT-A7000 is no longer Sony's latest flagship, but it's still a Dolby Atmos all-star, offering clear and expansive sound alongside surprisingly potent bass from a single bar. You'll find premium design touches like a glittering glass top and the ability to add a subwoofer or surround speakers later. It's loaded with home theater extras like support for hi-res audio alongside 3D audio formats that rival Dolby Atmos like DTS:X and Sony's 360 Reality Audio. The bar also harbors a secret weapon for gaming in the form of dual HDMI 2.1 inputs with pass-through to support features like variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM). This is especially helpful if you have multiple gaming consoles and limited ports on your 4K TV to connect them. All of this comes at a high cost, but for serious gamers it could be worth the investment.—Ryan Waniata Inputs: Three HDMI ports (one with eARC), Bluetooth, optical, analog, USB, Wi-Fi. The Sonos Arc (9/10 WIRED Recommends) may seem pricey for a single hulking tube, but it rewards your investment with smooth and detailed sound for music and movies, and immersive Dolby Atmos, with more bass than you'd expect. It also offers a nifty feature that lets you swap TV sound with the Sonos Ace(8/10, WIRED Recommends), as well as the ability to sync up with other Sonos speakers, though due to Sonos' recent app issues, we have only gotten the headphones function to work with iPhones so far. The Arc is otherwise still loaded with features, letting you stream content from multiple services and access Alexa or Google Assistant via built-in mics. It isn't cheap, and it's oddly short on inputs for the money, but its versatile design and excellent performance still make it a top option in its class for those after a single bar that does it all.—Ryan Waniata Inputs: HDMI eARC, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, optical (via adapter). Many companies offer basic 2.1 soundbars, but very few pack the soundstage of this Dolby Atmos-enabled bar from Polk (7/10, WIRED Recommends). It’s simple and easy to set up, with a basic, no-frills remote and an HDMI ARC connection to plug into a modern TV. You can choose between Movie, Night, and Music modes, which serve their intended purposes well. Cinema mode works in a simulated 3.1.2 Atmos surround—it’s pretty room-filling! Music mode gives you a more normal stereo image. Night mode limits the subwoofer action so you don’t wake the neighbors. The reason this scores lower than other bars we've reviewed on this list? We prefer a backlit remote control, and we wish it had Wi-Fi. Inputs: HDMI eARC, optical, Bluetooth. Sony's Quad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) isn't a soundbar so much as a discreet audio system for those who hate the fuss and form of traditional setups. The four wireless speakers (just add power outlets) blend with your decor and come complete with mounting bits for setting them on consoles, tables, or walls. Sony's advanced processing lets you futz with placement options, combining digital virtualization with 16 individual drivers for the most immersive Dolby Atmos performance I've heard in an all-in-one solution. The central control box connects over HDMI eARC for playback control with your TV remote, and a spare HDMI input provides console support for advanced gaming features. It all runs smoothly via Sony's Bravia Connect app, which also assists with setup. The Quad extracts a very hefty price, including the need for aSony subwooferfor full-throttle bass, but for those after transformative sound without disrupting the vibe, it could be the perfect pick. Inputs: Two HDMI ports (one with eARC), Bluetooth, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi. This Dolby Atmos soundbar from JBL has a pretty neat party trick: detachable wireless surround speakers. Want more immersion when you're watching a show or movie in your stylishly designed space? Just pop off the two speakers on the side of the main soundbar and place them behind you as wireless surround speakers. That makes them great for those without power outlets or who don't want to hide cable runs to the rear of the room. WIRED staffer Ryan Waniata says the bar sounds excellent (8/10, WIRED Recommends), with some of the best Dolby Atmos immersion he's heard from a soundbar at this price. He also likes that calibration will tune the sound to your room. The downside of wireless surround speakers? They need to be charged between uses (just pop them back on the soundbar between viewing sessions if you want them juiced up and out of the way). Inputs: Three HDMI ports (one for eARC), Bluetooth, optical, USB, Wi-Fi. This dual-subwoofer soundbar system from Japan provides earth-shattering bass, courtesy of two huge subwoofers, while a pair of side speakers and rear speakers offer more lifelike reproduction than soundbars that bounce sound off the walls for side and rear noises. It also features support for all major object-based surround formats, like DTS:X and Dolby Atmos. It’s a super-large system for most spaces, but if you have a big room, the extra bass response helps things feel more cinematic. Those side and rear drivers make it great for playing online video games, where hearing footsteps behind you comes in handy. Because it's been around a while, it's usually on sale for well below its original price. If your budget is flexible, there's also anupgraded versionthat adds even more power alongside HDMI eARC connection for higher-bandwidth audio transmission. Inputs: Three HDMI ports (one for ARC), optical, coaxial, Bluetooth (AptX). Five small speakers and a compact under-couch subwoofer make up this extremely easy-to-use system from Platin Audio (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It usesWiSAtechnology to stream and sync audio from a puck that you place near your screen or projector. It’s among the simplest surround-sound setups I’ve had the pleasure of setting up, requiring just a power source for each speaker and a single HDMI cable to plug into the puck. From there, an app and your TV’s remote control the system. This has come to be among my favorite rigs for testing because I don’t have to move anything other than an HDMI cable between devices. I also like how sleek and well-made the speakers are, with beautiful woven cones and black cases that don’t get in the way visually. You can get the Platin Monaco system with Dolby Atmos rear surround speakers now, a replacement pair that shoots sound effects toward the ceiling from the rear to bounce it down above your head for full immersion. I like the standard system enough to still recommend it over the Atmos option if you're on a budget, but splurge for Atmos if you have the cash. Inputs: HDMI eARC, optical, coaxial, Bluetooth. There are a lot of great soundbars out there, and we don’t have room to feature them all. Here are some others you might want to consider. Samsung HW-Q800C for $598:If Samsung's HW-Q990C everything bar is too rich for your blood, the two-piece HW-Q800C (WIRED Recommends, 8/10) could be a good compromise. This bar offers a similar sound signature as Samsung's flagship bars many of the same features, packed into a smaller bar-and-subwoofer combo for a notable discount–especially since it's now almost always on sale. Sennheiser Ambeo Mini for $700:This pint-sized luxury bar is great for those with money to burn in very small spaces. Sennheiser's built-in Ambeo virtualization technology brilliantly throws sound all around you for exhilarating TV and movies, and offers advanced features like support for Google Assistant and Alexa. Sony HT-X8500 for $300:Sony's HT-X8500 is getting harder to find, but it's still one of our favorite options for those after a single bar with solid bass response and expansive sound, including decent Dolby Atmos virtualization. While it's pricier than our top bar, it's a great alternative for those after a bit more, and worth considering while it's still available. Roku Streambar for $130:If you’re after a soundbar that doubles as a great streaming device, WIRED senior editor Adrienne So swears by the Roku Streambar. After she spent years without one she was so impressed that she shouted it from the rooftops. Setup is easy, and because it includes Roku’s simple streaming interface you can stream movies and shows at up to 4K HDR from just about every streaming service. You can also add a Roku subwoofer or surround-sound speakers down the line. We encouragegetting a sub. Vizio Elevate M-Series for $500:If you want full-featured Dolby Atmos and you like a bit of flair, Vizio's second Elevate bar is worth considering. Drivers pop out of the side and aim toward your ceiling when Atmos content is playing, giving it a nifty party trick to show your pals. Sound quality is solid too, and we like the compact design and easy setup. However, you will have to route some speaker cables for the rear surrounds. The Yamaha SR-C30A for $276: This model SR-C30A soundbar looks very similar indeed to the SR-C20A, and that’s because they’re the same thing where dimensions, specification, and sound quality are all concerned. The difference is that the SR-C30A ships with a compact (335 x 160 x 364mm) wireless subwoofer for some authentic Hollywood-style rumble and punch. —Simon Lucas Sennheiser Ambeo Plus for $1,200: Given the price and the physical dimensions of the soundbar—which doesn't even include a subwoofer—the Ambeo Plus might look like a poor deal. But thanks to its 400 watts of power and its nine carefully developed and even more carefully positioned speaker drivers, this Sennheiser is capable of big, enveloping sound with a strong suggestion of the sonic height that Dolby Atmos soundtracks thrive on. By way of an encore, it turns out to be a hugely capable wireless speaker when you want to listen to some music, too.—Simon Lucas The Polk React for $269:This soundbar works if you want to get surround sound eventually but don’t have the cash right now. The Alexa-enabled soundbar is fine on its own, with surround speakers and subwoofers available from Polk if you want to upgrade. The Vizio Elevate P-Series for $700:This is an awesome-looking soundbar with side speakers that swivel skyward when you’re watching content with object-based audio. It’s a nice-sounding bar, and that gimmick is neat, but there are better options for under $1,000. We have yet to test a new TV that didn’t sound crummy without an audio accessory. That’s mostly due to the way televisions are designed. Great-sounding speakers are bulky, and as TVs have gotten thinner, with shrinking bezels and sleeker designs, manufacturers are having a harder time building good speakers into them. You can spend as little as $150 on a new soundbar with a subwoofer, andit’s essential to getting the most out of your viewing experience. Our list of the best soundbars we’ve tested includes soundbars sold on their own and models that come bundled with a subwoofer at a wide variety of price points. Read on for more advice on building your affordable new home theater setup. We’ve included a list of available connectivity options next to every soundbar on our list. Virtually all soundbars will connect to your TV via optical or HDMI cables—HDMI being preferable in most cases. If your TV and soundbar both have an HDMI-ARC port (the cable port looks like regular HDMI, but it’s labeled ARC or eARC),connect it that way. It will allow you to use the volume buttons on your TV remote to control the soundbar’s volume. Also,make sure CEC is enabled. Use an optical cable only if HDMI isn’t available, as HDMI is also necessary for Dolby Atmos and other 3D audio formats. Finally, check your TV audio menus to make sure your TV’s internal speakers are set to off (so you don’t get any weird audio fluttering) andfind the best spots to place your speakers and sub. Stumble onto any A/V or home theater subreddit or forum and you’ll see a mob of people claiming even the idea of a soundbar matching up to a pair of speakers is heresy. The truth, as far as we’re concerned, is that it all depends on your individual wants and needs. If you’re looking for the most musical bang for your buck, especially when it comes to hi-res audio and vinyl record collections, a great pair of bookshelf speakers is likely your best option. Even if you’re not keen on shopping for an amplifier and running speaker wires, ourbest bookshelf speakers guideoffers plenty of powered/active pairs that include all the inputs and amplification built-in—like a soundbar system for audiophiles. That may not be the best option for everybody, though. If you’re just after something cheap and simple to soup up your TV sound, or on the other end, a convenient way to explore exciting audio formats like surround sound and Dolby Atmos, a soundbar could be the perfect choice. Soundbars are affordable and hassle-free sound solutions, many of which offer sound and features that may match your needs better than a pair of speakers or a traditional home theater setup. We take no sides here, we just love good sound and great features. For many, a soundbar is the best way to get there. This is a question only you can answer, but there are a few points to consider before making a call, starting with your living space. If you live in a smaller apartment or multiplex, a subwoofer may not be the best choice due to both its size and its likelihood of arousing noise complaints. Modern soundbars like the Klipsch Flexus Core 200 have gotten increasingly good at reproducing convincing bass from a single bar, often utilizing multiple speakers in concert to bring more punch to lower frequencies without causing lots of boom and bombast. If you're less concerned about close quarters and looking for more cinematic punch, you should highly consider a soundbar with a subwoofer. Physics can only be stretched so far, and no multi-speaker system we’ve heard can match the punch and potency of a dedicated large driver and acoustic cabinet. Even many affordable soundbar models include a subwoofer. If you want full-throttle sound, we suggest considering going all in for a subwoofer, or at the very least, a bar that allows you to add one later.

    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. Do you everfind yourself wondering, “What is Web3?” You’re not alone. The idea is having a moment, whether you’re measuring byVC funding,lobbying blitzes, orincomprehensible corporate announcements. But it can be hard to tell what all the hype is about. To believers,Web3represents the next phase of the internet and, perhaps, of organizing society. Web 1.0, the story goes, was the era of decentralized, open protocols, in which most online activity involved navigating to individual static webpages. Web 2.0, which we’re living through now, is the era of centralization, in which a huge share of communication and commerce takes place on closed platforms owned by a handful of super-powerful corporations—think Google, Facebook, Amazon—subject to the nominal control of centralized government regulators. Web3 is supposed to break the world free of that monopolistic control. At the most basic level, Web3 refers to a decentralized online ecosystem based on the blockchain. Platforms and apps built on Web3 won’t be owned by a central gatekeeper, but rather by users, who will earn their ownership stake by helping to develop and maintain those services. Gavin Wood coined the term Web3 (originally Web 3.0) in 2014. At the time, he was fresh off of helping develop Ethereum, the cryptocurrency that is second only to Bitcoin in prominence and market size. Today he runs the Web3 Foundation, which supports decentralized technology projects, as well as Parity Technologies, a company focused on building blockchain infrastructure for Web3. Wood, who is based in Switzerland, spoke with me last week over video about where Web 2.0 went wrong, his vision of the future, and why we all need to be less trusting. The following interview is a transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length. WIRED: As I understand it, the idea of Web3 at its most basic level is that the current setup, Web 2.0, is no good. So before we talk about what Web3 would entail, how would you describe the problems with the status quo? Gavin Wood: I think the model for Web 2.0 was much the same as the model for society before the internet existed. If you go back 500 years, people basically just stuck to their little villages and townships. And they traded with people that they knew. And they relied on, broadly speaking, the social fabric, to ensure that expectations were credible, were likely to actually happen: These apples are not rotten, or this horseshoe doesn’t break after three weeks. And that works reasonably well, because it’s difficult and very time-consuming and expensive to move between towns. So you have a reasonably high level of credibility that someone is going to stick around and they don't want to be exiled. But as society moved into something larger-scale, and we have cities and countries and international organizations, we moved on to this weird kind ofbrandreputation thing. We've created these powerful but regulated bodies, and the regulators, in principle, ensure that our expectations are met. There are certain statutory requirements that, to operate in a particular industry, you must fulfill. This is not a great solution, for a few reasons. One of them is, it's very hard to regulate new industries. The government is slow, it takes a while to catch up. Another is that regulators are imperfect. And especially when they work closely with the industry, oftentimes there's a bit of a revolving door relationship between the industry and the regulator. Another is simply a regulatory body has very limited firepower. It's how much money the government puts into it. And so necessarily, regulation is going to be patchy. They will be able to regulate maybe the biggest offenders but they aren’t able to retain a really strong influence all the time everywhere. And of course, the regulators and the laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If you go somewhere in the EU, then Activity X is fine; if you go somewhere else, then it’s not fine. And as we become a very international society, this effectively means that your expectations are still not being met. So we need to move beyond this. But unfortunately, Web 2.0 very much still exists in this very centralized model. Are we really talking about a failure of technology? Or are we talking about a failure of governance and regulation and competition policy? It sounds like you’re saying: Yes, it’s a failure of regulation, but the answer isn’t better regulation; there needs to be a new layer of technology, because regulatory failures are inevitable. Am I characterizing your view correctly? Yeah, absolutely. The model is broken. So let's talk about what should replace it. We've been talking about why Web 2.0 is not working. What's your handy elevator definition of Web3? “Less trust, more truth.” What does “less trust” mean? I have a particular meaning of trust that’s essentially faith. It's the belief that something will happen, that the world will work in a certain way, without any real evidence or rational arguments as to why it will do that. So we want less of that, and we want more truth—which what I really mean is a greater reason to believe that our expectations will be met. It sounds like you're saying “less blind faith, more credible trustworthiness.” Yes and no. I think trust in itself is actually just a bad thing all around. Trust implies that you are you're placing some sort of authority in somebody else, or in some organization, and they will be able to use this authority in some arbitrary way. As soon as it becomescredibletrust, it's not really trust anymore. There is a mechanism, a rationale, an argument, a logical mechanism—whatever— but in my mind, it's not trust. You've written that Web3 will bust platform monopolies like Google and Facebook. Can you explain how it will do that? Yeah, I guess the thing is, I don't know if it's going to—I mean, I think it's a logical improvement. And I think in the grander scheme, it’s inevitable. Either it’s inevitable or society’s going down the pan. But in terms of concrete, it’s a much more difficult question to answer. But, OK. In terms of technology, what do we have? We have cryptography. Cryptography, at its basic level, allows me to talk to my friend but for the communication channel to be public or go through a third party with me still having a good level of expectation, credible expectation, that it will be a private conversation. It will be as private as if we were in a field and chatting to each other and could see there was nobody around. Just taking encrypted communication as an example, that so far seems very compatible with corporate monopoly. Like, WhatsApp offers encrypted communication. There’s some controversy over the degree to which that is truly satisfying your desire for privacy, but I would still argue that that’s an example of encrypted communication that’s controlled by one of the most powerful companies in the world and has billions of users. It's an interesting one, and on the face of it, sure. But there are a few important differences. One of them is, what if WhatsApp introduced into their service a key that allowed them to decrypt all conversations? How do we know that it’s not there? You have totrust. We can't see the code, we can't see how their service runs, we can't see their key structure. So all we have is the blind trust that they are telling the truth. Now, OK, maybe they tell the truth because they're scared that their reputation will take a big hit if they don't. But then, as we saw with some of the Snowden revelations, sometimes companies don't get an opportunity to tell the truth. Sometimes, security services can just install a box in their back office, and they're told, “You don't need to look at this box, you're not allowed to say or do anything about this box, you just have to sit quietly.” It sounds like open source software would accomplish what you’re talking about, but you’re not just describing open source software. When we talk about Web3, we're talking about the blockchain, which is a completely different way of architecting the internet. So how, technologically, do you achieve this lack of dependence on trust? I think a degree of truth is necessary. And by this I mean openness, transparency. Blockchain technology uses both cryptography and certain game theory economics to deliver its service. We need to understand the node infrastructure of the network; is it really peer-to-peer or is it actually run from one data center by a company that manufactures and sells hardware and is required to be consulted before a new node can come online? The details make the difference as to whether it's basically just Web 2.0 in disguise or whether it is actually legitimately open, transparent, decentralized, peer-to-peer. Let's drill down on the idea of “decentralized.” I mean, the internet already is decentralized, right? Internet protocols are not owned by a company. While on a practical level, people tend to route their behavior through gatekeeper platforms, they don't necessarily have to. You don'thaveto message on Facebook, it's just convenient. So when we talk about centralization and decentralization, what does that mean? In essence, it means I personally can become a provider or a co-provider of this overall service just as easily as anybody else in the world. How realistic is that, though? From where I sit, it’s hard to imagine anyone outside of a small subset of people with high technical literacy actually exercising that right to participate in providing the service. And in that scenario, it sounds like you would have a different kind of centralization. Perhaps it would be more than just, you know, a handful of all-powerful CEOs, but it would still be a small subset of people for whom that's a meaningful freedom. There's a big difference between having a right or a freedom that you could execute if you had bothered educating yourself well enough, and the inability at a very basic and fundamental level of doing something because you lack the inclusion in an exclusive group. If I educate myself well enough on material that is freely available, and that's all that is required to become a co-provider of the service, then that is a free service. I went to law school, and I could say, look, anybody could learn the law. Anybody could study, get into law school, and then study for the bar. But in fact, at least in the US, it is a guild with very high barriers to entry, most notably cost. Even if the barriers to entry in the legal profession are higher than in programming, that doesn't necessarily mean that the barriers to entry in the world that you come from are not meaningfully high. I understand the distinction you’re drawing, but I wonder if that's sort of a naive—forgive me—reading of social arrangements to think that everybody just kind of has the choice to go become an expert Web3 programmer? No, of course. In principle, this isn't about being a Web3 programmer. You should be able to enjoy most of the ability to evaluate something without being an in-depth core developer. But there are an awful lot more programmers in the world than there are lawyers. And there's a good reason for that. Programming a machine actually only requires knowledge of a language that is reasonably straightforward to learn. You can be in a random little village in India, that just happens to have an internet point, and you can learn JavaScript in a week. You can't do that with American law. I’m not going to try and persuade you that literally every person in the world could do this. But the point is that the more people that can do this, the lower the barrier, the better. This still feels a little abstract. Someone who's reading this might be thinking, “What would I bedoingin a Web3 world?”Can you sketch out what that might look like? A certain a certain kind of activity or app interface or transaction? I think I think the initial breed of Web3 applications will probably be mostly small iterations on Web 2.0 applications. But one thing that Web3 brings that Web 2.0 cannot easily service is financial obligations or economically strong applications. This is where individuals in a peer to peer fashion can have economic services between themselves. This isn't about sending money per se, but it's about sending things that are or can be credibly rare, or credibly difficult, or credibly expensive in some way. So we can imagine, for example, dating apps where you can send virtual flowers, but we can only send one bunch of virtual flowers per day, regardless of how much you pay. And one could imagine, therefore, that sending a bunch of flowers every day to the same person is a very strong signal that they're into you. And this is a signal that you can’t game—that's the whole point. You can't pay to send more flowers. I don't mean to be a killjoy, but I feel like Tinder could just add that functionality to Tinder. Theycould,right. They sort of do—there’s the star thing that you can only do once per day. But guess what? They're a profit-motivated company. So if you pay Tinder enough, you can just send as many stars as you want. But won’t companies built on Web3 still have the same market incentives as Web 2.0 companies? I could be missing something obvious, but it's hard to think of technological developments throughout history that didn’t allow for more concentration of political or economic power. So why should we expect this blockchain-based, decentralized Web3 to break the mold? I've always been into technology, since being a youth. I learned to code when I was like eight years old. I've never seen a technology that existed to limit one’s power. As you've said, every technology that I can think of has served to make the user more powerful. They can do more stuff. They can be richer, they can fulfill the service that they provide faster or better or to more people. Blockchain doesn't do that. It's fundamentally different. It's effectively a social construct. It's a set of rules. And the only thing that these rules have going for themselves is that there is no one with arbitrary power within the system. You can be reasonably certain, especially if you're a coder, then you can you can look at the code and know that it's doing the right thing. But you can also be reasonably certain just on the basis of the fact that so many people have joined the network on the back of this expectation. And if this expectation were not met, they would just leave the network. A lot of people have gravitated toward crypto because they see it as a way to overthrow the existing political order or the power of central banks. But you've suggested that Web3 will help support the liberal, postwar order. How do you see it doing that? I think the services and the expectations that we have are under threat because of the centralization of power that the technology allows. It's just a fact. There's not much that has come along before Facebook and Google that allowed that level of power for such few people. It's not that I don’t think Facebook and Google and all the rest of it deserve to be displaced, but that's not exactly the crux of Web3. For me, Web3 is actually much more of a larger sociopolitical movement that is moving away from arbitrary authorities into a much more rationally based liberal model. And this is the only way I can see of safeguarding the liberal world, the life that we have come to enjoy over the last 70 years. It's the only way that we can actually keep it going 70 more years into the future. And at the moment, I think we are very much flirting with quite a different direction.

    "news_title": "The 10 Best TVs We’ve Reviewed, Plus Buying Advice (2024) | WIRED",
    "news_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more. Saving up fora new screen? Whether you’re a videophile or a budget shopper looking for your first foray into 4K Ultra HD, the best TVs available right now are bigger, brighter, and cheaper than ever. To help you navigate the dozens of models from Samsung, LG, TCL, Hisense, Sony, and others, we've done intensive testing and watched hundreds of hours of content to grab the standouts from our recent reviews. Below you'll find everything from the very best TV we've tested to the best sets on a tight budget—with plenty of excellent options in between. All of these models have at least 4K Ultra HD resolution (one has 8K), because there's no good reason to buy a standard HDTV beyond a pint-size model for your kitchen or small bedroom. Every TV on our list comes with a wonderful display, but most are bad at sound and can have lackluster interfaces, so you should considerinvesting in a good soundbaror pair ofbookshelf speakersand aTV streaming stick. If you're unfamiliar with TV lingo, check out our tips below and ourHow to Buy a TVguide to study up. Updated September 2024: We've added the Hisense U7N, the Sony Bravia 9, and Vizio's baseline 4K TV. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just$2.50$1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content.Subscribe Today. With gleaming brightness, excellent black levels, and voluminous quantum dot colors, Hisense’s U7N (8/10, WIRED Recommends) looks way better than a TV at this price has a right to. The TV lists at $1,000 for the 65-inch model we tested, but you’ll usually find it on sale for $750 to $800, or as low as $600 for the 55-incher. Even if that’s stretching your budget, this TV is worth the splurge, which is why it’s our current favorite for most buyers. Along with its punchy picture performance, the U7N provides great gaming features like VRR (variable refresh rate) and ALLM (auto low-latency mode), a dedicated game bar, and support for 4K gaming at up to 144 Hz. Other spoils include an intuitive Google TV smart interface and surprising extras like an adjustable audio output that lets you use your TV remote to control the volume for older soundbars and receivers. It still shows some budget tendencies, like middling off-axis performance and minor screen uniformity issues, but for most viewers, especially those new to the world of 4K HDR, this TV is bound to delight. —Ryan Waniata It's no secret that we're fans ofRoku's smart TV interface—that's a big reason TCL TVs with Roku smarts topped our TV list for so long in the midst of worthy adversaries. Now Roku has stepped out and is making its own TVs in-house, and the company's Roku Plus Series TVs serve as a great entry point for those on a budget. I spent a month or so testing the Plus Series and came away pretty darn impressed with its picture. Sure, you don't get a high refresh rate for gaming (this panel is limited to 60 frames per second, which is still fine for most consoles), but you do get excellent color via the quantum-dot-enabled (QLED) panel. Full-array local dimming means solid black levels, and this model is even supported by HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant, making it a great affordable smart TV. ★ Take it up a notch:If you're after Roku smarts but with higher performance, we also like theRoku Pro Series TV, which provides improved picture quality thanks to features like mini LEDs for enhanced contrast and a 120-Hz panel for smoother gaming and better motion handling. —Parker Hall TVs have gotten insanely bright in 2024, and the Hisense U8N (8/10 WIRED Recommends) is among the brightest of the new order. To give you an idea of its potency, the 65-inch model's peak brightness pushes toward twice that of the U8K (8/10, WIRED Recommends), one of 2023's brightest TVs. That kind of spectacle takes some getting used to, but it pairs with the U8N's quantum dot colors for dazzling performance even in rooms flooded with light. An onboard ambient light sensor can help keep the brightness in check when the sun goes down, while the TV's mini LED backlight system allows for fantastic contrast and black levels. The U8N adds good usability thanks to a loaded Google TV interface, a speedy 120-Hz panel, and plenty of gaming features, including dual HDMI 2.1 ports for standards like VRR and ALLM to get the most out of the bestgaming consolesand PCs. The new pedestal stand adds some extra class, too. The U8N's mid-tier pricing equates to some compromises like mediocre off-angle viewing and some over-sharpened images, but few TVs match the U8N's brightness and even fewer top its performance value. —Ryan Waniata LG's C4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best high-end TV for most folks. The slim-bezeled OLED offers eye-watering brightness and color, with support for Dolby Vision that Samsung's rival S90D notably lacks. I love the magic remote, which is like a Wii remote for your TV that lets you point and click at what you want on screen (it's really awesome for logging in to your myriad streaming accounts). Couple that with support for Google Chromecast and Apple Airplay for easy casting from your cell phone, plus the ability to do 4K at up to 144 Hz across all four inputs while gaming, and you have yourself the perfect centerpiece for your fancy modern living room. —Parker Hall You may think your current TV is bright enough, but Sony’s masterful Bravia 9 QLED TV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) begs to differ. Its powerful mini-LED backlighting system is among the brightest we’ve tested, which combines with proprietary dimming technology to serve up incredible contrast and black levels. Add in Sony’s excellent picture processing for vivid detail and vibrant yet restrained quantum dot colors and you get a stunningly realistic viewing experience across content. Restraint is key to the Bravia 9’s success. Its blazing brightness is judiciously distributed for exhilarating highlights and full-picture punch without the eye-blasting overload of cheaper brightness powerhouses. Off-axis viewing is also impressive for an LED TV, though the trade-off is some screen rainbowing with direct reflections. Sony continues to skimp on HDMI 2.1 support, with only two of the flagship's four HDMI ports providing modern features like 4K gaming at 120 Hz. Those knocks aside, this QLED TV is a modern marvel (with a price tag to match). —Ryan Waniata Samsung’s S90D is one of the baddest TVs you can buy (9/10, WIRED Recommends) right now. Its OLED display provides incredible contrast thanks to perfect black levels and impressive brightness, while the use of quantum dots (available in the 55-, 65-, and 77-inch models) brings intense yet marvelously natural colors. Its gaming bona fides include 144-Hz refresh rate support across all four HDMI inputs, VRR, and built-in cloud gaming for Xbox, Luna, and others. Gaming aside, I loved everything I watched on this TV, from 4K HDR Blu-rays to the 2024 Olympics. While it doesn’t offer Dolby Vision HDR support (Samsung opts for HDR10+ instead), the S90D is otherwise fully loaded at a price that comes in below flagship rivals. —Ryan Waniata Sony's A95L (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is simply the best-looking 4K TV I have ever seen, adding quantum dots to an OLED display for fabulous colors and an even brighter picture than its fantastic predecessor,the A95K. Samsung makes these panels, but Sony adds its special XR processing for pristine clarity and color shading that feels at once natural and immersive. From a performance perspective, it's hard to find a flaw. Sony must have thought the A95L was perfect since the brand won't be updating it for 2024, adding twonew mini LED TVsinstead. Apart from its picture, the TV folds in many of the extras you'd expect in a modern flagship display, including top-tier gaming features (though only across two of its four HDMI inputs), an intuitive Google TV interface, and surprisingly good onboard sound. The A95L isn't for the budget shopper, but rest assured it's as stunning to look at as it is costly to bring home. —Ryan Waniata As we've noted in previous coverage, 8K TVs can be a tough sell since 8K content is still scarce and the files are enormous. Luckily, Samsung's 8K TVs do a swell job upscaling 4K video, which is especially handy for larger screen sizes. Samsung's bright and beautiful QN900C (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes in sizes ranging from 65 inches up to an 85-inch monster. The TV's 33 million pixels are matched by fabulous picture processing, potent brightness, and vibrant colors. It all adds up to showy spectacle that's tough to rival. The QN900C is our current go-to model, not because it's the latest from the brand, but because its status as last year's flagship makes it much more affordable. We've only gottena glimpse of 2024's QN900Dthus far, but we once again feel comfortable recommending most 8K adopters save big on last year's model. Along with its sparkling 8K resolution, the QN900C is fully loaded with options like Samsung's pedestal-style floating-screen design, and the latest gaming features for a top-tier experience. —Ryan Waniata Last year's S95C QD-OLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) was Samsung's most impressive display, offering phenomenal brightness for an OLED TV, fabulous colors, and generally incredible picture quality, bolstered by great features and stunning design. For 2024, Samsung takes an even bigger swing with the S95D (8/10, WIRED Recommends), adding an anti-reflective screen coating for incredible glare resistance. Even direct lighting from inches away is dissipated with surprising efficacy. The trade-off is that the S95D tends to lose some perceived depth in direct lighting, as the black backdrop swaps obsidian gloss for a duller matte coating. This is really only noticeable with very dark backgrounds in bright rooms, but it could be a reason for some to consider thesale-priced S95Cwhile still available. Otherwise, the S95D looks fantastic day or night, with brilliant contrast and brightness that beats every OLED we've evaluated so far. Add in the same great features and design from last year, and you've got a killer QD-OLED that can take on even the toughest glare.–Ryan Waniata This cheap TV from Vizio supports Dolby Vision and has an easy-to-use interface that allows flawless app casting from Android and iOS. It's hilariously cheap for these features; a 55-inch model will set you back a little over $300. You can choose from a ton of sizes, ranging from a 48-inch guest-bedroom TV to an 85-incher for the living room. You'll miss out on perfect black levels, because this TV doesn't have the fancy mini-LED or OLED panels you'll find on other picks on this list, but at this price you can't really complain. These TVs look shockingly good and can even game at 120 frames per second in 1080p, which is all that anyone really needs for most consoles. —Parker Hall There are so many wonderful TVs now available, there's a good chance even those that didn't make our top picks could be a fantastic option for you. Here are some of our favorites that just missed the cut. Samsung S95C:As noted above, the S95C (8/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a fantastic choice. It may even be the better option for those who don't want or need the matte screen of the 2024 model, still standing as one of the very best OLED TVs you can buy—especially given its seriously accessible sale pricing. Sony Bravia 7:The Bravia 7 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a gorgeous display, offering brilliant brightness, naturalistic colors, and suave finesse in the subtle details. Its biggest knock is poor off-axis viewing, which could be tough to swallow at its high list price. Otherwise, it's worth consideration for fans of that Sony glow, especially since Sony seems to be uncharacteristically discounting multiple model sizes. Samsung QN90B:Another great deal while still available, Samsung's QN90B (8/10, WIRED Recommends) was long our favorite bright-room TV. It's available in a wide range of sizes and provides a bright and colorful picture and plenty of goodies—especially enticing considering its continuously sinking price tag. If a TV isn't made byLG,Samsung,Sony,Hisense,TCL,Vizio,Roku, orPanasonic(which recently returned to the States) make sure you've done your research. These are our favorite manufacturers at the moment. A cheap set might look enticing for the price, but try to avoid dirt-cheap models from brands like Sceptre, which may not offer good picture quality or a durable build. If your budget doesn’t extend to a new model from the above brands, we recommend looking into last year's TVs sold at steep discounts and often offering only modest differences. You could also look at factory-refurbished options, but these are obviously less reliable. Read ourHow to Buy a TVguide to learn more about the terms you'll come across when shopping for a screen, and other helpful advice. Buying a TV requires navigating a sea of lingo, so let's quickly define a few key terms. You can also read more about these terms in ourHow to Buy a TVguide.
