The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2% in Wednesday'sstock market trading, again hitting resistance at the 21-day line. The S&P 500 index sank 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite gave up 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 edged down 0.1%, still above its 21-day line. Reddit(RDDT) skyrocketed 42%, whileGarmin(GRMN) gapped up 23%, among the many leading stocks soaring on earnings.

Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy Microsoft earnings and revenuebeat fiscal Q1 views, as its Azure cloud-computing revenue growth came in at 33%, above expectations. The Dow tech titan guided slightly below views for fiscal Q2. Microsoft said it plans capital spending of $80 billion in the current fiscal 2025, which started in July. That's up from $49 billion in fiscal 2024. That could weigh on Microsoft earnings, but is good news for AI hardware plays. Microsoft stock fell solidly in extended trade. Shares edged up 0.1% to 433.53 in Wednesday's regular session, in Google's cloud-led earnings beat. MSFT stock has been moving off its 21-day, 50-day and 200-day lines. The traditional consolidation buy point is 468.35, with 441.85 offering an early entry. But Microsoft has been a laggard for much of 2024. Meta earnings easily beat while revenue slightly topped. Daily active users came in slightly below views. The Facebook and Instagram parent guided Q4 revenue slightly higher at the midpoint. Meta guided full-year expenses slightly lower but guided up a fraction on capital spending and forecast \"significant capital expenditures growth in 2025.\" Meta stock fell modestly in overnight action. Shares dipped 0.25% to 591.80 on Wednesday, just below the top of a short consolidation. Microsoft and Meta earnings and guidance are key forNvidia(NVDA) and other AI hardware plays. Nvidia stock declined slightly in late trade. Shares fell 1.4% to 139.34 on Wednesday, just below a 140.76 buy point, following weak AMD sales guidance. Arista Networks(ANET), which boasts Microsoft and Meta as major customers, lost a fraction overnight. Shares fell 1.4% on Wednesday, holding the 21-day line. Crypto-related trading app Robinhood,cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and bitcoin investor MicroStrategyall reported weaker-than-expected Q3 results. MicroStrategy, which has borrowed heavily to buy bitcoin, announced plans to raise $42 billion in equity and debt to buy more of the cryptocurrency. Robinhood stock plunged while Coinbase declined solidly and MicroStrategy fell. COIN stock has been flirting with a buy point. Ryan Specialty stock and GoDaddy were little changed. DoorDash edged higher. Lemonade(LMND) soared on better-than-expected results, while another upstart insurer,Root(ROOT), skyrocketed. Communications software makerTwilio(TWLO) andSprouts Farmers Market(SFM) also jumped overnight. Early Thursday,SharkNinja(SN),Uber Technologies(UBER) andRoblox(RBLX) are on tap to report earnings. So far the stock market rally has handled earnings season just fine, but there's plenty to come. We'll see how markets respond Thursday to Microsoft and Meta, withAmazon.com(AMZN) andApple(AAPL) due Thursday night. Friday's jobs report follows, along with the Nov. 5 Election Day, the Nov. 7 Fed meeting announcement and much more. Aside from earnings gaps, there haven't been many recent buying opportunities, and several of those companies have earnings in the next few days. So aside from incremental buys or portfolio tweaks, investors don't need to do a whole lot. But stay engaged and have your watchlists ready.
