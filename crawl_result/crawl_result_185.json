    "news_title": "Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Says 80-90% Correction Is Over With 100% Jump Imminent",
    "news_content": "The Cardano pricehas faced severe downward pressure compared to other cryptocurrencies in the past few weeks. ADA recentlystarted a fresh drop belowthe $0.3550 zone and is now down by about 15% in the past 30 days. This lackluster performance has kept many ADA holders in the red zone, with unrealized losses mounting as the price continues to struggle. As a result, it is only natural for many to keep selling to reduce their losses, which in turn could cause the ADA price to keep falling, at least in the short term. The current ADA price action is very difficult to deal with, especially for long-term holders who have continued to hold despite the laggard performance. According toan analyst on TradingView, the best way for these ADA holders to keep approaching the ADA price outlook is to keep holding. This is because the drop is already quite advanced and we can say that 80 to 90% of the correction is already over for this pair. To put things in perspective, Cardano is currently trading around 56% below its 2024 high of $0.7742, despite broader market rallies seen in September and October. According to crypto analyst Alan Santana on TradingView, ADA appears to be consolidating around the same price levels seen in November 2023, showing limited upward momentum. In comparison, most other large market cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Solana, and BNB are already on their way to retesting their 2024 highs made in the first quarter. Interestingly, there exists a possibility of Cardano dropping lower in the coming months, especially if Bitcoin were to correct massively. However, as analyst Alan Santana pointed out, Cardano is already almost done with its corrections. As such, a fresh drop in the ADA price wouldn’t be a super strong drop and would last only a few days or maximum a few weeks. According to Santana, selling ADA now may not be the best move, especially for those who have held throughout the corrections. This is because prices are already really low for ADA, and is already in the accumulation zone. As such, a prudent action would be tofocus on the long termand wait until the next bull market enters in full swing. Santana’s price projection for ADA suggests that while another slight drop could occur, it would likely be followed by a gradual recovery from November 2024 to February 2025, with a more significant bullish phase expected to gain momentum by March 2025. By that point, Santana forecasts a potential return for ADA above $0.70, representing a 130% increase from its current price levels. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.3371, having increased by about 1.25% in the past 24 hours.
