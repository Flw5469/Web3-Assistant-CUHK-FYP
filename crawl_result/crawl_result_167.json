Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. Cardano (ADA) is signaling an imminent reversal after a 7-month correction, with a potential parabolic bull run ahead. The ADA/BTC pair is retesting multi-year lows, suggesting a potential altseason opportunity. Despite recent developments, Cardano's on-chain activity remains stagnant, which could limit its upside potential. Cardano is the dark horse of the crypto world! As Bitcoin continues its historic bull run, breaking new price records, the spotlight is shifting towards altcoins, and ADA seems poised to steal the show. Thislarge-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.5 billion and a daily trading volume exceeding $373 million, has surged over 2% in the last 24 hours. As of Tuesday, October 29, it was trading around 34 cents during the early New York session. What is next? After being stuck in a macro correction for the past seven months,Cardano’s priceagainst the US dollar is now indicating a potential turnaround. The layer one (L1) altcoin has gained bullish momentum over the last four months, forming a weekly reversal pattern characterized by a double bottom and a bullish divergence in the weeklyRelative Strength Index (RSI). I believe#Cardano$ADAis following a similar pattern to 2020. If history repeats, we might see a pump around November 18—about two weeks after the US elections—and a potential market top by September 2025.pic.twitter.com/GgKWBqzYXU Crypto analyst Ali Martinez points out that ADA’s price movement resembles a fractal pattern seen during the 2020 bull market. Based on this pattern, Martinez is optimistic that ADA’s price will rally toward a new all-time high as the market enters a parabolic phase in the coming months. Additionally, the ADA/BTC pair is currently retesting multi-year lows, having been trapped in a downward trend since the fourth quarter of 2021. This situation could mark a critical turning point for Cardano as it tries to regain ground against Bitcoin. Despite some positive developments, such as the recent integration with the BOS bridge to access Bitcoin, theCardano networkhas seen stagnant growth in its total value locked (TVL) over the past year. This is in contrast to other emerging L1 networks like Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON), which have experienced more significant progress. Cardano's NVT ratio has surged to its highest level since June, indicating a decrease in on-chain activity relative to price growth.This classic overvaluation signal is notable given$ADA's recent underperformance, suggesting the potential for further downside.Historically,…pic.twitter.com/yTx83exBXM Market data analytics firm IntoTheBlock warns that ADA’s price may face a pullback due to low on-chain activity. For Cardano to succeed, it must reignite the on-chain momentum that has been lacking in recent months. Don’t miss out on the next big crypto opportunity. Keep an eye on Cardano with Coinpedia.
