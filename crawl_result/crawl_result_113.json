    "news_content": "Here is a 2-minute breakdown of everything important that happened in crypto today. Bitcoin just hit an all-time high - in 5 major currencies all around the world… While everyone's eyes were glued to the USD charts waiting for that magical ATH moment, Bitcoin quietly made records across the globe. Just ask Europe - BTC just smashed through €68,000, setting a new all-time high against the euro. And it's not just Europe feeling the heat. The Australian dollar? Record high. Canadian dollar? Same story. Even the Turkish lira can't catch a break against Bitcoin's momentum. But here's the problem - the US dollar chart is still the final boss, sitting just 2% away from uncharted territory. And the market? Cool as a cucumber about it all. So what’s causing this blocker? Let’s make sense of it all! Here is a quick rundown of the top headlines from the past 24 hours: Now, let’s dive in! Bitcoin had everyone on the edge of their seats Tuesday when it climbed to $73,562 - just $175 shy of breaking its all-time high. The interesting part? The crypto community barely blinked. No meme storms, no Twitter craze, no celebration threads. Just business as usual. Maybe it's because the market is growing up. When you've seen Bitcoin range around $70,000+ for weeks, another high number might not get your heart racing like it used to. If no one is really excited, how is the price peaking? Read thefull story! A new stablecoin just hit Solana, and it's doing something different. sUSD isn't just another digital dollar – it's backed by U.S. Treasury bills and automatically pays you interest in USDC. The interesting part? You can get started with just $5. That's right - government bonds, traditionally a playground for the wealthy, are now accessible to anyone with a few dollars to spare. Most stablecoins just sit there, doing nothing. But sUSD works more like a savings account, quietly earning you returns while you hold it. And if you ever need your USDC back? No waiting period - just instant swaps. What’s the APY? And how can you stake it? Read thefull story! Ever had loyalty points expire before you could use them? Or found yourself with a wallet full of rewards you'll never redeem? Circle and HKT are about to change that game in Hong Kong. The company behind USDC just partnered with Hong Kong's tech giant HKT. Their mission? Transform those dusty loyalty programs into something you'll actually want to use. Why only Hong Kong? Will it expand this program worldwide? Read thefull story! Bitcoin's latest rally isn't just making crypto traders happy - it's lighting up the Korean stock market. Companies with even a hint of crypto connection are seeing their stocks shoot up. Take Woori Technology - their shares jumped 14% in a single day. Why? They own a chunk of Upbit, one of Korea's biggest crypto exchanges. Are Korean companies investing that heavily in crypto? Read thefull story! The U.S. Treasury just released its big plan for financial inclusion, and there's something weird about it. Despite crypto's growing role in finance, the Treasury only mentions it as a risk to watch out for. It's an interesting position, especially when you look at what's actually happening in the crypto space. While the Treasury is focusing on traditional banking solutions, millions of people worldwide are already using crypto to access financial services they couldn't before. So what’s going on? Isn’t the US supposed to be pro-crypto already? Read thefull story! Content Editor at CoinMarketCap Join the thousands already learning crypto!",
