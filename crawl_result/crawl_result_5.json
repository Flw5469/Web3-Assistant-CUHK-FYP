This means that the number of Bitcoins can never reach beyond 21 million as its software limits them. No further bitcoins will be generated when the Bitcoin supply meets its upper limit. New bitcoin is created during the process calledmining, as transactions are relayed across the network, they are picked up by miners and packaged into batches called blocks, which are secured by complex cryptographic calculations. These miners receive rewards as compensation for spending their computational resources for every block that they have added to the blockchain. At the time Bitcoin was launched, the reward constituted 50 bitcoins/block. Bitcoin is secured with the SecureHashing Algorithm(SHA) -256, which belongs to the SHA-2 family ofcryptographic hashes. The protocol is also used by its forkBitcoin Cash (BCH), and several other cryptocurrencies.When Bitcoin transactions happen, they undergo security verification and are grouped into a block to be mined. Following this, Bitcoin’sPoW algorithmgenerates a hash for the block. As discussed earlier, Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm – and it always produces hashes with 64 characters. When transacting coins, you typically do it on your personal computer.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Halving 2028 Date & Countdown | CoinGape",
    "news_content": "SIRWIN Bets.io Ybets Est. Time Remaining Predicted Date Remaining Blocks Total Blocks Live Bitcoin Price Market Cap The upcoming Bitcoin Halving event is estimated to take place in April 2028, approximately aftercalculating... Bitcoin halving event holds a special place in the crypto industry.  The event occurs every four years, after every 210,000 blocks are mined, reducing the supply of new coins circulating by half. Halving gradually reduces block rewards for miners, helping manage supply and demand to increase Bitcoin’s value. Halving is a direct reflection of the pseudonymous creator ofBitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision, making it a valuable digital currency with limited supply. To maintain the value of Bitcoin through scarcity, the block rewards given to miners for processing transactions on the blockchain are halved. Nakamoto implemented the process into the Bitcoin code. The process of BTC halving will persist until all 21 million BTCs are mined. Completion is anticipated by the year 2140. To this point, BTC has experienced a total of three halving occurrences, which took place in 2012, 2016, and 2020. The most recent Bitcoin halving occurred on 11 May 2020, reducing mining rewards by 50% from 12.5 to 6.25 new bitcoins per block. The limited availability made Bitcoin bullish as its prices increased from $6877.62 on 11 April, one month before halving, to $8821 during the event. Despite experiencing considerable fluctuations, the price continued to rise throughout the following year and reached $49504 on 11 May 2021. A similar trend happened during the previous halvings in 2012 and 2016, with the most significant increase in value occuring after the event. The block rewards decreased by half to 12.5 BTC in 2016, and 6.25 BTC Despite a substantial decrease in value about 12-17 months later, the price still stayed much higher than before the halving in 2020. In the year 2024, the bitcoin block rewards will decrease to 3.125 BTC. A bitcoin halving is programmed into the foundational blockchain software of the network, controlling the speed at which new bitcoins are generated. The software makes computers in the network compete in a process called ‘mining’ to verify transactions, rewarding them with new bitcoins for proving the validity of selected transactions. Transactions are confirmed in clusters known as ‘blocks’ and the system is programmed to reduce the miner’s reward by half after every 210,000 blocks. Based on the Bitcoin price behavior in regards to the Halving event, there are 5 phases with different price chart patterns. While it is widely known that halving events bring price rally, there is more to its impact on the market price of Bitcoin. If we look at the price chart patterns of Bitcoin close enough, we can divide the impact into the following 5 phases. The Pre-Halving Downside phase occurs before the Bitcoin halving event, during which the cryptocurrency undergoes price decreases or corrections. During this period, there is a drop in the price of Bitcoin as traders expect the approaching halving event. The start of the Pre-Halving Rally phase indicates a change in market sentiment, suggesting Bitcoin may see upward movement before the halving. The Pre-Halving Rally phase usually takes place around 60 days prior to the Bitcoin Halving event. Bitcoin’s price experiences a sharp increase as investors look forward to the halving event. The surge in value is frequently driven by the anticipation of the event, prompting investors to join in on the enthusiasm. Short-term traders and speculators buy Bitcoin before the halving and selling soon after, employing a tactic called “Buy the Hype, Sell the News.” This action results in a Pre-Halving retracement. After the Pre-Halving Rally ends, the Pre-Halving Retrace phase usually occurs a few weeks prior to the Halving event. In this stage, Bitcoin sees a brief decrease in price. This period of retracement may continue for weeks, causing investors to wonder if the Halving event will actually result in a price increase for Bitcoin. Following the Pre-Halving retracement, Bitcoin moves into a stage called Re-Accumulation, marked by a prolonged period of stability or plateauing (consolidation) and horizontal movement. This period can last for as long as 150 days, which is approximately five months. Many investors might be disappointed because of the absence of substantial price changes after the Halving event. Some investors may choose to leave their positions early due to feelings of boredom, impatience, and disappointment. The actual Bitcoin price rally after the Halving event is anticipated to start in the last phase i.e., Parabolic Uptrend. When the price consolidation period ends after several months of Halving, Bitcoin price breaks out to witness a sharp uptrend movement. This phase previously led Bitcoin to record new all-time high prices and is estimated to happen this time as well. All the price predictions of BTC after Halving will hold true during this period with investors regaining optimism in Bitcoin investment. This leads to what we call a bull market since a price surge in BTC will have a positive impact on altcoins and other industry projects. Bitcoin undergo halving as aresult of its software being designed by an unknown individual or group who goes by the pseudonym ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’. Although Satoshi has not provided a clear explanation for halvings, it is believed by many that the purpose was to increase the initial distribution of coins in order to encourage more individuals to participate in the network and engage in block mining. According to this theory, block rewards were designed to decrease by half periodically since it was anticipated that the value of each rewarded coin would rise as the network grew. Another hypothesis suggests that the halvings were implemented to incorporate deflationary tactics in the currency, with a fixed number of new coins distributed per block. Contrary to the fiat money system’s tendency to decrease currency value through central bank overprinting, the fixed supply and predetermined rate of new bitcoin creation minimize this risk. Bitcoin halving has been criticized for promoting saving over spending, as users anticipate the coins’ price will rise. This could have sparked periods of rapid economic growth followed by sharp declines in the past, as individuals held onto coins until reaching certain levels before selling them. Others have made a comparison between bitcoin and a pyramid (Ponzi) scheme, citing that the design of the system has unfairly benefited early users. When the block reward is cut in half, certain users might realize that their mining operations will no longer be cost-effective because of expenses like electricity and equipment. If the price of bitcoin doesn’t increase enough, certain users might choose to completely stop mining, resulting in a decrease in processing power within the network. Regardless of the circumstances, the rate at which blocks are generated should remain constant because the software will adjust the complexity of verifying transactions accordingly. Once all 21 million bitcoins have been mined, users will stop earning new bitcoins for verifying blocks. Nevertheless, they will keep getting transaction fees – provided by those who are making payments – as a reward for verifying transactions. It is estimated that the final bitcoin will be mined by the year 2140. At this stage, the cryptocurrency will turn deflationary as coins can be ‘lost’  accidentally through user mistakes, such as sending them to an incorrect address. There are multiple ways you can trade the upcoming Bitcoin halving. You can either buy the coins onpopular crypto exchange platformsor speculate on its price changes by using derivatives like CFDs. In case you don’t want to interact with Bitcoin by directly buying and selling the coins on exchanges or wallets, CFD trading is the right option for you. Some of thebest CFD brokershelp you make speculative bets on the future prices of Bitcoin. Trading derivatives such as CFDs has following advantages when compared to trading Bitcoins directly on exchanges. Best CFD Brokers The first Bitcoin halving event took place on November 28, 2012, reducing the initial block reward of 50 BTC to 25 BTC. At the time of the event, the Bitcoin price was trading at around $13. Even though there was no substantial impact on the price right after the halving event, Bitcoin rose in value and reached the $1000 mark after 1 year, in 2013. The rising awareness of Bitcoin and gradually improving adoption are the major reasons behind this price rally, in addition to the halving event. The second Bitcoin halving event occurred on July 9, 2016, further slashed the mining rewards by half. This time, the block reward of Bitcoin was reduced from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. TheBitcoin pricewas trading at the $700 range during the event. Similar to the previous scenario, its price increased significantly and reached a new all-time high value of $20,089 more than one year after the event. The last Bitcoin halving or the third Bitcoin halving event took place on May 11, 2020. This time, the block reward of Bitcoin dropped from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. The Bitcoin price was around $8,000 when the third Bitcoin halving happened. It witnessed an incredible price surge in 2021 and finally reached the new all-time high value of over $68,000 in November 2021. Bitcoin Price has historically followed an upward price movement after halving events. However, we cannot say that it is only because of the halving events. While it is true that Bitcoin halving events reduce the supply and increase the value over the long term, they cannot directly alter price trends of Bitcoin. The price rise of Bitcoin majorly depends on the demand in market and user adoption. And, we cannot say for sure that the demand of Bitcoin will increase, considering the number of cryptocurrencies that exist in the market today. So, we cannot surely say that the upcoming Bitcoin halving will increase its price. What Are The Trending Crypto Coins of The Market Today? XRP Price Is About to Boom, Here Is Why?

Truth Terminal Creators X Hacked: $600,000 Lost In Memecoin Scam Why Is Gamestop (GME) Price Bullish Suddenly? There is a high possibility for Bitcoin reaching $100,000 after the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event in April 2024. Historically, the BTC price has always witnessed a price surge after each halving event. This time, the anticipation of the BTC price surge further increased with the upcoming Bitcoin spot ETF approvals. Though the Bitcoin price has always increased after halving events, there is no reliable metric to forecast when exactly the price rise happens. Sometimes, the Bitcoin price increased several months after the halving event. You should buy Bitcoin while its price is still low to benefit in the next bull run. For every 210,000 mined, which takes around four years, the Bitcoin block reward reduces by half. The mining difficulty gets adjusted to make sure that the Bitcoins are mined at a steady rate. In the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April 2024, the block reward reduces to 3.125 BTC and block height reaches 840,000. You can either directly buy Bitcoin on exchange platforms and wait for its price to increase in the future. Or, you can also enter CFD trading by speculating on the future price trends of Bitcoin. When a Bitcoin halving event takes place, it reduces the mining rewards. The major impact it will have on miners is their rewards will be reduced by 50% for successfully mining blocks. While Bitcoin halving is good for its long term price rise, miners may not appreciate it.

    "news_content": "SIRWIN Bets.io Ybets A cryptocurrency stock is a stock of a publicly traded company that runs operations heavily dependent on the blockchain or the cryptocurrency market. Popular cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency miners, blockchain technology experts, and other businesses with sizable cryptocurrency holdings on their balance sheets are among the companies whose stocks are included in this list. The cryptocurrency stocks can be easily accessed by anyone with an online brokerage account because they all trade on the Nasdaq Composite or NYSE in the United States. The majority of cryptocurrency stocks are expected to see their share prices rise over the long term if cryptocurrency adoption and use continue to grow across the globe, according to analysts and investors in the space. However, not every investor may want to make an investment of this volatility. It depends on your investment profile. If you are a seasoned investor and want to invest in an alternative asset class, crypto is a good option for you. However, if you are a novice trader and still learning the market dynamics, you might consider crypto investment a short term option. Cryptocurrencies are considered a comparatively volatile investment option. However, stocks have become a go-to investment alternative for the seasoned investors due to their less risky and less volatile nature. Socks have been an abiding and long-established asset class when compared to cryptocurrency. Stocks can yield both short and long-term returns. However, crypto is a recently established asset class with high volatility.

Bone ShibaSwap After extensive analysis, these are the top meme coins that caught our eye. Some of them are new meme coins such as Popcat, while coins like Dogecoin have been around for years. Read on to learn why we chose these coins. Poodlana ($POOD) is a new meme coin that has gained attention in the cryptocurrency market, specifically in the Solana blockchain community. The presale of the coin has seen remarkable success, with around $3.5 million raised, showing significant investor enthusiasm. Poodlana is a luxurious dog-themed token, dubbed the Hermes of crypto. It has allocated 500 million tokens for sale, with the rest going to marketing, liquidity, partnerships, and rewards. Token holders can trade immediately after the sale, unlike other tokens that remain locked for months. The coin seeks to take advantage of the trend of meme coins, particularly in the Asian market, where it is predicted to succeed because of the cultural love for poodles and the high trading volume during Asian trading hours.  Memeinator is the new top meme coin. It is powered by a profound mission and possesses technology comparable to that of Skynet. It aims to revolutionize with strong marketing, innovative products, and an engaging action game. Memeinator is a well-made product to take over the meme coin market. With a 5-6% increase in the token’s cryptocurrency value guaranteed during each phase, thememeinator whitepapershowcases how the ICO structure has been carefully designed.  It is an initiative by Telegram founders to showcase the optimum utility of the Telegram channel by leveraging the meme coins community. Dogs Coin is thenewest meme coincreated to build a strong community of people in love with dogs and develop the welfare of dogs globally. It is designed on TON Blockchain. It seeks to foster a disruption of a community for those with similar interests in dogs, a platform to share one’s passion, and support organizations that support the welfare of dogs.

People who hold DOGS coins have the opportunity to invest in a worthy cause while profiting from the cryptocurrency. With rising interest in cryptocurrency and dog-related initiatives, Dogs Coin’s market position may shift in the future making it one of thebest dog-themed meme coins to buy. All stars crypto is finally here after all the buzz and hype. The reason why this coin was enjoying the internet frenzy is clear. Within the three days since the presale announcement, All Stars has raised $382,225. All Stars meme coin is an innovative cryptocurrency that features meme vault for staking smart contracts.  As per thewhitepaper,  roadmap is primarily divided into three stages: memevault deployment, All Stars token launch, and presale. To participate in the presale, users will have to create a wallet, acquire cryptocurrency, and connect wallet. They will be able to stake the tokens and get benefits. It allows users to significantly stake All Stars by reserving 25% of the total supply for staking rewards. Staking is going to increase user earnings from the project. Dogecoin, the OG memecoin that started the meme revolution in the crypto industry. It is ‘the best memecoin’ that is ever created in the history. It is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency supported by a vast community consisting of tech behemoth, Elon Musk. While theDogecoin Whitepaperdid not have a significant roadmap, its community has carried it along. Investment in dogecoin is something that does involves risk but also a hope for a big jump. Coming from a crypto enthusiastic community, Dogecoin has a reputation of showing unimaginable chart spikes.  Meme coins with a dog theme are always creative and incredibly entertaining. This is one of those. The Shiba Inu dog wearing a hat is the focal point of this coin, which runs on the Solana blockchain. Shiba Inus do not require an introduction. In the cryptocurrency world, it is one of the popular meme coins that is created a lot of buzz. In 2020, SHIB, best meme coin, entered this market with a wave of meme coins. Due to its decentralized structure and vibrant community, it attracted millions of viewers. Despite being nothing more than a meme at first, this token soon embraced a massive developer community that created a decentralized ecosystem around it. As per thewhitepaperEthereum-based SHIB token has become a global phenomenon by 2024 and is even accepted as payment on a number of platforms. Shiba Inus gained enormous popularity very fast because of the entertainment value they offered. SHIB’s price jumped from as low as $0.000000000056 to an all-time high of $0.000084.  Pikamoon is a recently launched, highly prospective memecoin. It is a blockchain-based gaming project. The “Pikaverse,” the project’s native metaverse, is explored by players as they engage in combat and search for gems. In this play-to-earn game, players advance through the four unique Pikaverse regions and receive rewards for completing tasks. According to thePikamoon Whitepaper, PIKA is used to redeem rewards. PIKA tokens can be exchanged for other tokens or used to buy in-game boosters like spells and potions. Additionally, holders of PIKA tokens will be qualified for a complimentary NFT. Pikamoon is anticipated to be the pepe coin of the meme world. As Pepe created a huge buzz and helped many recover losses, PIKA is likely to do the same. The coin is currently listed on popular exchanges like Bitget and MEXC. Pika is currently dealing at $0.001813. The marketcap of Pikamoon is $14.62M.  Another dog themed meme coin developed onERC-20. Floki Inu strives to be user-friendly and have a vibrant meme scene. It has three major features, namely, the meme, utility, and charitability. One could accurately refer to it as a cryptocurrency created by supporters and members of the Shiba Inu community. Floki whitepapermentions the intention behind introduction of $FLOKI was to give users interacting within the Floki Ecosystem a simple and safe way to settle disputes and make payments without the need for middlemen like centralized third-party entities, institutions, or credit.  Pepe Coin is a decentralized meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain, inspired by the popular internet meme “Pepe the Frog.” It was launched in 2023 and quickly gained popularity due to its association with the iconic meme. This cryptocurrency focuses on using the image of Pepe the Frog to develop a community and a viral marketing model. The meme coin trend can be explained by the fact that the more people hear about the meme, the more investors it can attract to participate in the coin. The Pepe Coin has a mechanism to increase the amount of supply that is being burned, thus decreasing the number of coins in circulation. This deflationary characteristic can lead to the ever-higher price of the tokens due to the constantly rising demand.  Dogwifhat is a new meme coin operating on the Solana network. It evolved from the Shiba Inu’s craze and is essentially an enlarged version of it in terms of appearance. Dogwifhat appears to be nothing more than a Shiba INU dog with a pink knit cap on. Dogwifhat, which is frequently referred to as a successful coin, has the potential to increase in value and provide investors with significant returns in the future. Experts predict that following the halving of Bitcoin, Dogwifhat will hit $9.9. So, make sure to keep an eye on this coin. Imagine that in a single day, your investment increased by 182%. This was only possible if you showed your money on Dogwifhat. In 2023, thissolana meme tokensaw an 182% increase in value on the first day of launch. This meme coin features a dog wearing a hat creating a massive community that has more than 50,000 members. This coin is now actively partnered with exchanges like Binance, realizing its enormous potential, and it functions well as a part of the Solana ecosystem.  Bone ShibaSwap is a shibaarmy token that helps the community cast their vote on the upcoming proposals in the domain. It is a governance token for the Shibaswap ecosystem. The value of your vote increases with the number of Bone tokens. While the Shiba token is already popular and priced by the market, we expect other coins in its ecosystem like $BONE to surge next. In terms of the number of tokens in circulation, BONE, which has 250,000,000, is perfectly positioned in the market.  A meme coin is a type of cryptocurrency that derives its identity from a meme, animal, or comical character. These depictions are often humorous and easily recognizable, which helps to attract a dedicated community. Meme coins rely heavily on community support and social media campaigns to gain popularity and increase in value. The community-driven nature of these coins means that their value is often influenced by social media trends, celebrity endorsements, and overall market sentiment. Dogecoin is the meme coin with the largest market cap and utility. It is a utility meme coin and has a strong ecosystem. Dogecoin is both a means of payment and a store of value. Furthermore, Elon Musk’s support for Dogecoin also adds to its appeal. So, from an investment perspective, it makes sense to hold DOGE. This makes Dogecoin one of the best meme coins to invest in. However, most of the coins on this list were well-researched and good options if you want to get into meme coins. Here are the top meme coins by their market cap: The price was last updated on 15th October 2024. If you’re looking to find new meme coins, you must consider what drives their value. Here are some common factors that drive the price of the top meme coins: A meme coin is considered successful if it can secure social media hype. Think of some of the most successful meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe. Social media played a huge role in the growth of these coins. Social media creates hype and FOMO. Once the project secures social media visibility, its prices soars as well as trading volume. A project’s community plays a huge role. Top meme coins like Dogecoin have solid community support. Active communities can create value for a project through coordinated buying, social media campaigns and other marketing efforts. Elon Musk’s public endorsement of Dogecoin was one of the milestone moments for meme coin. Celebrity endorsement often influences the prices of the top meme coins as they can sway public opinion about the coin and drive interest. Listing on prominent exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, and OKX often affects the prices of meme coins. These listings often lead to increased visibility and create a sense of credibility about the project. Predicting which meme coin will reach $1 is challenging due to the volatile and speculative nature of these assets. However, several factors can influence their potential to reach this milestone including community support and social media presence. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Floki are the most likely meme coins to reach $1 thanks to their large market caps and community support. There are several factors to consider when getting a meme coin. This includes the exchange you’d like to use. There are lots of exchanges to pick from. But we advise that you pick reputable exchanges like Binance, OKX, Kucoin, eToro, Kraen, and Bitget. It is also important to consider if the exchange supports users from your country. Some exchanges are best suited The following are the steps you’d need to follow to make your first meme coin purchase: Step 1:Pick an exchange/Create an account Step 2:Select your funding method. There are different options to make your purchase. Some exchanges support debit/credit card purchases  or direct crypto deposits. Step 3:head to the exchange’s trading pairs and search for your meme coin Step 4:Choose an amount Step 5:Confirm purchase Step 6:Transfer to a hard wallet for better security While this is the general process, the steps to buy meme coins will change depending on the exchange of your choice. Most meme coins have become popular due to their popularity and virality on social media platforms such as X and Reddit. Dogecoin took off when Elon Musk started joking about it and started posting memes on X. Similarly, early Shiba Inu investors banded together to form the “Shib Army.” They were an enthusiastic community promoting $SHIB on every social media platform through memes and engaging with new users. Eventually, it worked. They were able to bring in more new users into the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which led to a price increase of $SHIB and created an even larger community. See below for a 1-year growth chart of $SHIB.  While Meme coins are often highly  speculative, they have provent to be beneficial in other aspects. It is without a doubt, that most investors are looking to invest in meme coins for their returns. Some meme coins like Doge and Shiba have given multi-fold returns in the past and new meme coins could do just that. Most meme coins explicitly don’t have any utility. Investors are attracted towards them for their community. For example, cat-lovers and people who love cat-themed memes are drawn towards MEW and their community. The social aspect of meme coins can be interesting for investors. Meme coins usually have a huge supply and are priced very low. So they’re easy to buy and have fun with, instead of considering them as serious assets. A lot of meme coins are there purely to have fun and provide a source of entertainment for their investors. The now purpose, light-hearted nature of these coins make them fun for their investors. Buying meme coins isn’t always a walk in the park. There are certain risks a user might encounter: Meme coins are cryptocurrencies, and cryptocurrencies are volatile assets. The price swing of meme coins can be highly unpredictable. While prices can move upwards in reaction to certain events, they can also crash and cause users huge losses. meme coins are speculative assets. Their values are mostly drawn from social media trends, celebrity endorsement and community support. Most meme coins lack fundamental financial value. So, investors must be cautious in this high risk asset. Most meme coins lack clear use cases aside from their speculative nature. meme coins mostly rely on hype and community interest for value unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that are used for payment, fees, or powering applications. The meme coin market is largely unregulated, which can be a huge risk for investors. The lack of regulation means users  have little support against market manipulation, fraud and other market frauds. Most meme coins are new projects with no track record or financial support. So, the possibility of rug pulls and other scams are common with meme coins. Investors must thoroughly research projects they are interested in to avoid falling victim to scams. Meme coins can sometimes face liquidity issues, making it hard for investors to buy or sell their holdings at preferred prices. Liquidity problems often occur when a meme coin loses popularity, leaving holders with assets that are hard to liquidate. The future of meme coins is still under the shadows, as they are highly unpredictable and a relatively new asset class. While some meme coins have created a huge buzz and gained significant popularity and value, a bunch have failed to gain traction. However, with multiple projects like PEPE, POOH, and others coming into the scene, meme coins seem to have a brighter future. Meme coins are expected to explode once market sentiments improve. And if you are looking for a good way to get as much as 100x on your investments, meme coins are a good way to get that since most of them are low cap projects with plenty of room for growth.However, meme coins are high risk-high potential assets with no intrinsic value.

A crypto presale allows investors to buy tokens ofnew cryptocurrenciesand blockchain projects before they are listed on exchanges. These presales often involve multiple stages with varying token prices and incentives. Tokens acquired during presales are usually priced lower, offering early supporters a discount, but they cannot be traded until the project launches on exchanges successfully. Understanding how crypto presale pricing works is essential. Each project may utilize a unique pricing mechanism, which can significantly impact investment outcomes and project funding. In this section, we explore the various pricing models used in crypto presales which are tiered pricing and fixed pricing. Tiered Pricing is a prevalent model in crypto presales. This approach involves selling tokens at incrementally increasing prices across multiple stages.Here’s a breakdown:  The number of stages in a tiered pricing structure can vary widely and is solely dependent on the project’s specific needs and goals. There is no standard answer to how many stages a project might have—it could range from 5 to 15 or even more. This flexibility allows projects to tailor their presale strategies to optimize funding and attract a diverse group of investors. Tiered pricing offers several advantages. It incentivizes early investment by offering lower prices initially, creates a sense of urgency as prices rise, and helps projects generate steady funding momentum. This structured approach can attract a wide range of investors and ensure sustained interest throughout the presale period. The second pricing model is, fixed price. Fixed pricing in crypto presales offer tokens at a constant price throughout the presale period. Overall, fixed pricing simplifies the buying process by providing a streamlined purchasing experience and reduces potential confusion by avoiding the complexities associated with fluctuating prices. In a fixed price crypto presale, tokens are offered at a constant price throughout the entire sale period. For instance, consider a presale where each token is consistently priced at $0.03. This stable pricing strategy continues without any fluctuations, allowing the project to raise a total of $1,500,000.

Crypto presales present high risks due to the potential for tokens to fail or projects to disappear upon listing. Similar toICOs, presales are vulnerable to scams and low-quality ventures, with even legitimate projects facing long paths to success or outright failure. Despite the risks, presales offer opportunities to acquire tokens at low prices that could appreciate significantly upon exchange listing and project success. Early investment provides backers with access to innovative projects and the potential to support ventures aligned with their interests. Buying tokens at discounted prices during presales provides early investors with the potential for significant returns once the token is publicly listed. This early entry not only maximizes profit potential but also allows investors to engage with and influence the project’s development from the ground up. Furthermore, presales often include additional perks such as bonus tokens or exclusive access to features, which can enhance the overall value of the investment. Despite their potential benefits, crypto presales come with notable risks. Projects can underperform or fail to meet their promises, leading to financial losses. The possibility of scams is also significant; fraudulent schemes may exploit the high-return allure of presales to deceive investors. Additionally, vesting periods can restrict the sale or transfer of tokens for a set time, limiting the ability to capitalize on short-term market movements. Therefore, while presales can be lucrative, they necessitate thorough research and prudent risk management to avoid pitfalls and make informed investment decisions. In this section, we outline a clear, step-by-step guide to help you navigate the presale purchasing process. Our five-step approach simplifies the investment process, ensuring you understand each critical stage. Each step is accompanied by visual aids to enhance your understanding and provide a straightforward roadmap. Firstly, find a promising project that aligns with your investment goals from the list above. When you have a project you like, you can simply click on the Visit link that will take you directly to the project’s official website.  Once you landed on the official website, you can review the project’s terms, conditions, and tokenomics to fully understand the investment’s implications and potential returns.  Next step is to connect your wallet. Ensure you have a cryptocurrency wallet with the necessary funds. Connect your wallet to the project’s presale platform, following the instructions provided.  Choose your preferred payment method and specify the amount of the presale token you wish to purchase. Confirm that you have enough funds in your wallet to cover both the purchase amount and any associated transaction fees.  Complete the transaction by following the prompts on the presale platform. Double-check all details before confirming the payment. Be prepared to pay network fees, which are required for processing the transaction on the blockchain.

An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is the launch of a new cryptocurrency and the sector’s equivalent to an initial public offering (IPO). ICOs are crowdfunding methods of crypto projects, where interested investors can support aupcoming ICOproject by buying its native crypto tokens. ICOs are a way for new crypto projects to gain funding and attention or launch a coin, token, app, or service. As well as the data in our top ICO list, there are a number of characteristics to look for to identify the best ICOs. First, find out the potential return you could gain on the project, then balance any risks. Here’s a quick list to get you started. A founding team and any visible backers or advisors should be visible on a top ICOs website. You can then research this team’s reputation by checking Google or LinkedIn. Just like checking out a project’s founders, take a look at the developers; sometimes this is one and the same. What’s their experience? What successful projects have they already completed? The core of the ICO is the whitepaper. Whitepapers should be clear, well-written, and understandable and detail the project’s achievable aspirations, ICO terms, technical aspects, and any prudent information for investors. Top ICO roadmaps are clear and achievable and should allow investors to check a project is on track. Above all, a good ICO should demonstrate transparency for investors. If you are struggling to find information to answer any of your prudent questions, it could be a sign of a problem. This has two facets: review the technology the ICO will use for its development, network, and coin, and if the ICO is funding new technology, then is that technology viable? It’s always wise to take a look at an ICO’s social media channels, take a look at the social media accounts of the founders and team, and see what other people are saying about the project on social media and in forums. The chances are a good ICO has already been reviewed by a number of analysts who are usually unbiased and will give an open opinion on the project’s aspirations and the potential return. Finally, make sure you can find and review in detail any terms and conditions relating to your investment, including how the coin will be issued, governed, and managed in the future Investing in ICOs requires careful selection and thorough research to mitigate risks and maximize potential returns. Begin by identifying promising ICOs, then delve into detailed analysis to determine the best fit for your investment goals and risk tolerance. Further, understanding the risks involved in ICO investments is crucial. That is why we have listed some of the common risks with ICOs. Investing in ICOs carries significant regulatory uncertainty, as many jurisdictions have yet to establish clear guidelines or laws governing these investments. This lack of regulation increases the risk of potential legal challenges or regulatory changes affecting your investment. Unlike traditional investments, ICOs often lack investor protections such as disclosure requirements and regulatory oversight. This absence of safeguards increases the risk of fraud, market manipulation, and loss of funds due to unforeseen circumstances. The cryptocurrency market, including ICOs, is highly volatile and prone to speculative trading. Fluctuations in market sentiment and external factors can lead to rapid price changes, posing substantial risk to investors who may experience significant gains or losses in short periods. Many ICO projects are early-stage ventures with unproven concepts and business models. Investing in these projects carries the risk of technical failures, project delays, or even abandonment, impacting the project’s ability to deliver on its promises and affecting investor returns. On the whole, people buy ICOs with the expectation that the coins they buy will gain in value when they become listed on exchanges and/or when the project is fully completed. ICOs can see new cryptocurrencies sold at low prices, and cryptocurrencies can gain value quickly when they are released to the open market, but they can also quickly depreciate in value. The other reason to invest in an ICO is to support the technology, product, or service that is being developed. ICOs have funded some of the most important technological developments in the blockchain space, like the Ethereum smart contract blockchain and other third-generation blockchains answering problems that will help crypto reach mainstream adoption. Once you have completed your thorough research into a top ICO you want to buy, the next part of your investment is to buy the ICO tokens. The likely steps you’ll take are as follows: You’ll either have a compatible wallet already or need to download and set up a wallet. Always make sure you use a reputable product and follow the maximum security options to ensure your transfers and balances are safe. Most ICOs will specify the crypto they accept in return for the ICO tokens; usually, this will be a coin like Ethereum or Tether. Each ICO will outline specific “How to Buy” instructions. Often, this consists of connecting your wallet and making the transfer of the cryptocurrency you will be paying with. The ICO you are investing in will have outlined how and when you will receive your ICO tokens. Selecting the best ICOs to invest in requires a strategic approach with thorough research and analysis. From blockchain innovations to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, these ICOs offer promising opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on emerging technologies. Projects like Mbxau,All Stars, FortifiedX stand out for their innovative solutions and strong market potential, backed by robust teams and effective use cases. These crypto ICOs not only promise disruptive advancements in sectors such as technology, AI, DeFi, etc. but also aim to address real-world challenges through blockchain technology. Table of content An ICO works by allowing early investors to buy tokens with cryptocurrencies like ETH or BNB, by sending funds to a provided wallet address, with token prices set based on demand. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are widely unregulated but can be legal if they comply with SEC regulations. Buy ICOs directly through crypto exchange platforms like Binance, Coinbase, OKX or others. You can also follow the steps on this page to make a direct buy of New ICOs. A few ICOs, such as Ethereum, have yielded significant returns for investors. However, many others have been fraudulent or performed poorly, making it crucial to thoroughly research each project before investing.

Admiral Markets can be considered a good option for the traders who need a quality broker that offers many opportunities to trade in the financial markets, offering many assets and materials to learn from.

A crypto broker is a company that acts as an intermediary for users who wants to trade crypto assets. It has a simple design and offers its users a way to purchase and sell a variety of digital currency, suitable for novices and professionals. Crypto brokers provide a larger number of cryptocurrencies than traditional crypto exchanges, and they also may include exotic tokens and altcoins. Such a broader choice allows for choosing less liquid and more promising securities and reaping a profit from forming trends. Besides, most cryptocurrency brokers offer other financial services that can be useful for cryptocurrency trading and increase the profitability of operations, including leveraged trading, borrowing, and even exchange traded funds. However, it must be understood that crypto brokers may not be as flexible and handy as any decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. While you can easily purchase and trade in cryptocurrencies from these platforms, you may not be able to fully control your trades or avail of some of the enhanced trading features. Crypto exchanges are online markets where you can directly engage another party and sell/buy crypto assets from/to them. While thebest crypto exchangeshave larger selections of coins compared to crypto brokers, they serve a multitude of users with different requirements and tolerance for risk when trading crypto. Especially, they can offer a greater number of crypto assets, including many altcoins, pumps and dumps tokens, and exotic coins. Additionally, crypto exchanges may also offer other features that include staking, margin trading, and derivatives, andfutures tradingwhich give better trading opportunities. Crypto exchanges can be even more difficult to navigate than crypto brokers, a user will require more technical prowess and know-how. They may offer better trading platforms, more products to trade, better types of orders, and higher customization levels. But, this adds the extra profitable layer of flexibility for you and your trades along with the overall results. The following elements should be taken into account when selecting a cryptocurrency broker: When selecting the best cryptocurrency broker, it is of essence to consider the reputation of the broker because this attribute determines the trust and reliability of the broker. Choose trustworthy broker who have been providing their services for a few years and who are popular among users and other top crypto brokers. Such brokers tend to be more experienced and are rated highly based on performance, reliability, and the exercise of ethical practices in the business. Also, prefer working with traditional online brokers supervised by other reputable financial markets like the FCA of the United Kingdom or the SEC of the United States. Looking at a reputable cryptocurrency broker, it would be clearly illustrated that the provider has little to no negative feedback from users, has strong security measures in place, and few to no scandals or legal problems. The review section, checking of their regulatory status, and searching for any past scandals would help in identifying an adequate broker. The cost factors include the fees charged by traditional brokers who provide cryptocurrency trading services, which affect profits. Some of the aspects that need to be considered include the fee charged by the broker for trading, deposit and withdrawal fees, and other charges. Some brokers demand the trader to pay them via a commission or through the spread when trading. Alow-fee crypto platformcould provide tiny spreads in the sense that they may charge a smaller difference between the buying and selling price of the crypto assets. Further, some brokers may also charge inactivity fees or fees for using certain services, for instance, withdrawing funds and/or engaging in other premium services. It is also prudent to understand the costs you need to fully identify with every transaction you make since high charges can reduce your returns, especially if you are planning to frequently trade cryptocurrencies. For this reason, identifying brokers’ fee structures will assist you in finding affordable brokers. Security is paramount when dealing with cryptocurrency trading, given the rise in cyberattacks and hacking incidents in the industry. Choose a right crypto broker that implements stringent security measures to protect your assets and personal information. These measures should include two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of protection, cold storage for funds (where the majority of assets are stored offline), and encryption protocols to safeguard transactions and sensitive data. Reputable brokers often undergo regular security audits and are transparent about their security practices. Additionally, a good broker will have insurance coverage for digital assets, providing you with a safety net in case of breaches or hacking incidents. Look for brokers who are known for quickly addressing security concerns and who have not been involved in significant breaches. Prioritizing security helps mitigate risks, ensuring your investments remain safe in an unpredictable environment. Customer service is an essential component in facilitating efficient trading of products and services, particularly in the swiftly dynamic cryptocurrency market. Customer support should be available and dependable to assist in both technical concerns and account issues. It is recommended to work with the brokers who provide customer support round the clock since the cryptocurrency markets are open round the clock and problems can occur at any moment. The availability of support can be measured by the time taken to reply to a customer’s complaint, the courtesy of the support representatives, and the number of ways customers can contact the support team either through live chat, mailing, or calling. Some of the advantages of a good broker are also the presence of educational material and tutorials for both a beginners and an experienced trader, giving the customer a more complex experience. Heartwarming stories or positive words said about a broker’s customer support team can at times point to a broker’s loyalty to its clients. Timely customer service helps to solve problems when they appear and makes the trading process uninterrupted. Portfolio diversification is important to traders and investors who need a range of digital assets to meet the various opportunities in the market. Brokers who have many cryptocurrencies on offer allow the client to buy a more diverse portfolio, which may lead to generating more money. In addition to the leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the broker should offer a variety of other coins, including Solana, Chainlink, Polkadot, and some other new tokens that might have a better potential for growth. It enables traders to operate in several ways, from long-term investment to the speculative manner of trading. Also, the diversification of the offered cryptocurrencies might help the company access newer forms of cryptocurrency investments before they go viral. Still, it is also a good idea to know that the broker has adequate amounts of such assets to buy or sell them at your convenience. A broad spectrum of products is also believed to be a sign that the broker applies efforts toward meeting the demands of market evolution and offering its clients more options. Deciding on the ‘best’ crypto broker is relative, and it depends on what is most suitable for the user’s requirements and inclination. They include the number and varieties of cryptocurrencies available on the platform, the cost of transactions, the simplicity of the platform, security measures, responses to clients’ inquiries, and other services such as leverage and staking. It is impossible to conclusively determine that there is the best broker, but some excellent choices have emerged in the cryptocurrency market. On examples of companies, it is possible to name Coinbase as one of the leaders in the market thanks to its simple navigation, availability of many cryptocurrencies, and enhanced security. One popular platform is Robinhood, which offers hassle-free cryptocurrency trading without commissions and finds a lot of demand among inexperienced investors. Here’s why you’d want to use a crypto broker: The best cryptocurrency brokers have been developed with simplicity, and this aspect makes them suitable for both new and professional crypto traders. They have simple layouts, auto-generated order forms, and basic trading mechanisms that help you begin trading immediately. Cryptocurrency brokers usually demand lower commissions in comparison with other crypto exchanges, which is beneficial for small-scale operations. It can assist you in achieving your goal of enhancing your revenues and reducing your trading costs. Crypto brokers generally have a wider range of cryptocurrencies for trading crypto, and this includes new coins and different types of tokens. This means that you are offered a wider choice of investments, and you can choose from a greater number of stocks, bonds, etc. Some brokers provide other financial services apart from trading in cryptocurrencies and tokens. Some of these services might be like margin funding, a service that provides you with funds to open a larger trading position, and lending, where you can earn interest from your digital assets. As with any product, even the best cryptocurrency broker have their own set of limitations to deal with. Crypto brokers are not necessarily going to allow you the same amount of control of trading crypto that you have over your trades in crypto exchanges. You may have limited choices for modifying your orders, using sophisticated cryptocurrency trading platforms, or engaging in margin trading. Crypto brokers provide a rather broader base of cryptocurrencies than the cryptocurrency exchanges may provide but may generally not accommodate the exhaustive list as the exchanges. This could hamper investment opportunities and may reduce the freedom with which one could diversify his/her portfolio. Even the best cryptocurrency brokers, like any other online platform, do experience security threats. Although they usually do this to secure your money, it is not out of the question for breaches and hacks to happen. One must also avoid these risks by working with a reliable broker who has excellent security measures in place. The brokers dealing in cryptocurrency provide easy-to-use platforms where anyone can easily trade in cryptocurrencies thus making investment in cryptocurrencies easy. They can offer more cryptocurrencies than a standard cryptocurrency exchange and may have more services to help you trade and manage your money. However, it is imperative to give much consideration to the various brokers and choose the best that suits one’s investment needs and risk appetite. Please note that trading in cryptocurrencies is considered high-risk, and with that in mind, trading should not be done without ample research and knowledge of the risks involved. Table of content Yes, leverage trading is possible with cryptocurrency brokerage firms. This helps traders to amplify their positions. However, the leverage limit supported varies based on the chosen brokerage. Crypto trading brokers are not a necessity. If you only want to trade crypto coins, a dedicated crypto exchange might be well suited.  However, some crypto brokers help simplify trading processes and offer guidance on market prices, enhancing the overall trading experience.  Crypto brokers secure funds using different measures like cold storage, 2-factor authentication (2FA) for account access, encryption protocols to protect data and other regulatory measures such as funds segregation. Fund segregation reduces the risk of misuse or misappropriation. Other security tools include constant audits to identify and resolve possible vulnerabilities. These measures help create a sense of safety as users interact with these brokers. CoinGape prepared areview methodologyto rate crypto exchanges, tools, and apps.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are gateways for diverse financial interaction between cryptocurrency enthusiasts. They are platforms that enable cryptocurrency investors to buy and sell cryptocurrencies through different trading models. Cryptocurrency exchanges can be simple asset swap platforms like Changelly, or advanced trading platforms with support for spot and derivatives trading like Binance and Coinbase. Cryptocurrency exchanges pool traders together, providing an inclusive platform that supports concurrent trading by a large number of investors. They create an interface that enables users to create trade requests, these requests are handled by underlying protocols that connect buyers to sellers according to the trading model. Advanced trading operations on exchanges include crypto-to-fiat trading, OTC moderation, and derivative trading models. Exchanges hope to serve users according to their preferred mode of crypto trading. In addition to regular trading of crypto assets, some crypto exchanges offer additional services such as incentivized staking programs, promotional activities, and enterprise solutions like IEOs, IDOs, and market making. Cryptocurrency exchanges are similar to mainstream digital asset trading platforms. The mode of operation for certain exchanges could differ, however, the main idea is to create a platform where buyers and sellers can securely exchange assets. The primary roles of exchanges are user account management and handling trade requests. Exchanges use order books to keep a transparent record of the buy and sell orders. Through the platform’s interface, users set the parameters for their orders. This includes the price at which they wish to buy or sell the asset and the amount they wish to buy. If these parameters are different from the current price of the asset, they are added to the order book. The orderbook executes matching buy and sell orders. If the set prices are the same but the amounts differ, the remaining portion of the trade is re-added to the order and completed when another matching order is made.  Exchanges partner with third-party banking institutions to enable users to buy and sell crypto assets using their traditional finance institutions. On-ramp trade requests connect automatically to the partner platform that handles the crypto-fiat trade. The exchange handles the crypto part of the transaction while the bank handles the fiat side of the transaction. Exchanges charge fees for some operations. For regular trading, a set percentage of the traded amount is deducted once the trade is finalized. Exchanges also charge fees for crypto and fiat withdrawals. Crypto deposits are usually free of charge, but fees might apply to fiat deposits. Crypto exchanges are categorized according to their primary structure. They include; Centralized exchanges are permission-based trading platforms. They are also known as custodial exchanges, they hold funds on behalf of their users while they use the platform. Centralized exchanges require users to create accounts and provide basic personal ID information before they are allowed to trade on the platform. Most centralized exchanges use an order book to record orders and match trade requests. Benefits: Users can trade several assets from different blockchain networks simultaneously. Orderbook technology is faster than AMM used on decentralized exchanges. Drawbacks: The platforms keep custody of users’ assets and can lose them in case of a hack. Centralized exchanges also keep a store of personal information of users and can restrict investors from selected regions. Decentralized exchanges are self-custody trading platforms. They are permissionless (no restrictions and central control) and allow users to trade cryptocurrencies from their personal wallets. Most decentralized exchanges use the AMM (Automated Market Maker) technology to serve trade requests from users. AMMs useliquidity poolsas a store of crypto assets and match traders’ orders by exchanging the assets in the pools. Certain decentralized exchanges are also developing decentralized orderbook technology as a more efficient alternative to the AMM. Examples ofdecentralized exchangesinclude Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Raydium, and MinSwap. Benefits: They are relatively more secure as users retain custody of their assets throughout the trading process. Users also maintain their privacy, as user account creation and KYC verifications are not required to trade on decentralized exchanges. Drawbacks: Due to a lack of interoperability, decentralized exchanges are restricted to single blockchain networks. They also have significant additional fees in case of network congestion, and users are also vulnerable to front-running. Hybrid exchanges combine the strengths of decentralized and centralized exchanges to develop an ideal trading environment for crypto traders. They allow self-custody of assets and feature centralized orderbooks. As a self-custody platform, users’ funds are more secure while the centralized orderbook ensures faster trading and more transparent liquidity. Examples of Hybrid Exchanges include BinanceDEX, Nash Exchange, and Onomy protocol. Benefits: Hybrid exchanges combine the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges; users manage to maintain their privacy and asset custody while using a faster trading platform. Drawbacks: They are an emerging technology and could undergo significant changes, some of which might not appeal to users. The regulatory status and strength of the technology are not fully known yet. To ensure a smooth running of your trading activities, it is important to select an exchange that suits your needs. Here are some factors to keep in mind while selecting an exchange; The first thing to ascertain before creating an account on an exchange is the availability of financial services that apply to you. Most modern exchanges offer spot and derivatives trading of crypto assets. Ensure that the exchange supports your method of trading and the assets you wish to trade. Also, ensure that these services are available in your region as there could be restrictions for certain services. Review the additional financial services on the platform that apply to you. Funds held on centralized exchanges are vulnerable to hacks and mismanagement by the platform. In each case, users are left with tangible losses. It is therefore important that you understand how the platform handles funds left in their custody and the security practices. Most centralized exchanges practice offshore custody of assets in cold wallets, many other top-tier exchanges employ advanced security practices. Ensure that the exchange has a reliable security system for the funds in their custody. An insurance policy for customer deposits is also a good have. Check if your exchange has an existing insurance policy. Also, inquire about theProof Of Reserves (POR)for the exchange you wish to use. Review the provided data as they apply to you.  Ensure that the exchange is a registered financial service provider in your region. Genuine exchanges usually have proof of approval from the government of the region they operate. Inquire for this information as part of your due research. Using an unregistered exchange may have financial and security implications for you. To avoid significant slippages while trading on an exchange, it is advised to select a richly liquid exchange. The liquidity on a centralized crypto trading platform can be estimated using the orderbook. Parameters like orderbook spread, the total value of orders in each price level, and the daily trading volume give valuable insights into the liquidity of an exchange. On decentralized exchanges, the liquidity for each pair is simply the value of the asset locked in the liquidity pool (for that pair). Even for the most experienced trader, issues might arise while trading. Therefore, it is important to consider the available customer support system on an exchange before creating your account. Evaluate the responsiveness of the support team using reviews by existing users. Also, ensure that the exchange has sufficient platform guides and a 24/7 customer support system for quick responses. Signing up for a crypto exchange is a straightforward process. For this example, we’re using KuCoin. However, the process should be similar for any exchange that you choose from our list. Step 1:Visit the exchange’s website  Step 2:Click on Sign Up from the page to start the account creation process.   Step 3:Enter your Email, phone number, or any other detail required by the platform.  Step 4:Follow the email verification process to verify your email. (This process might differ for the exchange you are using. You might be required to create your account password before the email verification.)  Step 5:Enter your password to complete.  Step 6:Now your account is created, most centralized exchanges require proper KYC verification before you can trade on the platform. Step 7:Proceed to verify your identity to enable your trade. After KYC verification, you can now deposit to the exchange and start trading. The article provides a comprehensive comparison of various cryptocurrency exchanges for general purposes.

While there is no shortage of popular cryptocurrencies launching every day, it can be hard to keep track of them and find new tokens. Here are some of the best places that we use to find new tokens during our research: Presales are a great opportunity to buy cryptocurrency before they’re even launched. Some of thebest crypto presaleshave made investors incredibly wealthy by just getting in early. By checking outupcoming ICOs, you can get an idea of which new projects are available to invest in. Based on that, you can dig deeper into the projects you’re interesxted in. X (formerly known as Twitter) is the most popular space where the crypto community hangs out. So its the perfect place to discover new coins. Cryptocurrencies such as Doge have soared due to its popularity on X. However, you must also be aware that X also has loads of misleading information. Projects have engaged with bots to create an illusion of a vibrant community. Do not trust everything you see on X to be true. After X, Discord and Telegram are the two main platforms where the communities from popular cryptocurrencies interacts. There is a lot of useful information on some of thebest crypto telegram channels, and the same applies for Discord too. Keep a close tabs on the major exchanges and the coins they’re listing on a regular basis. At times, the news of a new coin’s listing alone sends its price soaring. Finally, you can also try to find new tokens on Reddit and YouTube. However, due to the restrictive nature of those platforms, you might not always be able to find good information early before everyone else. One reason investors are drawn to new cryptos is their potential for high returns. As an early investor, you might see substantial gains in a short time, especially compared to well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even these household names began as with uncertain futures. Chances are, you could be one of the very few investors in the project, giving you a voice. Some projects even have DAOs where your tokens are powerful and you can steer the project in the direction you like. Most cryptocurrencies see a surge in pricing when they’re listed on popular crypto exchanges. You get to capitalize on those as an early investor. Investing in early-stage crypto projects is an important strategy for most crypto investors. While well-established projects like Bitcoin can give safe returns, it is not going to be high. The price of Bitcoin is already high and it cannot 10x in a short period of time. So newer cryptocurrencies are used to balance out trading strategies. New cryptocurrencies gain value primarily through increased demand, practical utility, and scarcity. As a cryptocurrency gains popularity and is adopted for real-world use, its demand rises, which can drive up its value. Scarcity, often achieved through mechanisms like fixed supply limits, further contributes to value appreciation. Technological innovation and positive market sentiment, influenced by news, endorsements, or successful partnerships, also play significant roles in enhancing a cryptocurrency’s value. When Ethereum launched its ICO (Initial Coin Offering) in July 2014, theprice of ETHwas approximately $0.30. By the end of its first year, Ethereum’s price had risen to about $1.00. As the platform’s smart contract functionality and decentralized applications gained traction, the price continued to climb.  By December 2017, Ethereum’s price had surged to over $700, and it reached an all-time high of around $4,800 in November 2021. This dramatic increase in value was driven by growing adoption, technological advancements, and market interest, illustrating how new cryptocurrencies can appreciate significantly. Investing in new cryptocurrencies isn’t without its challenges, as they come with their own set of risks. The crypto market has seen an abundant number of scams. Some projects have raised money through ICOs or presales, only to fake project activity while investors lose their money. The market cap of new coins is usually very low and there is not enough liquidity on exchanges. So they’re prone to high price swings in both directions. Some new coins are not even listed on centralized exchanges. Thus, you have to learn to trade them on decentralized exchanges with slippage and other factors. They also often have very low liquidity.

We recommend diversifying your investments across various assets and thoroughly analyzing each one to manage risks and maximize potential returns. While Bitcoin has been a major player in the market for over a decade and the opportunity for early investment has passed, new projects like Blast, Dogwifhat, and Starknet are currently gaining traction.

We also considered the exchanges supported for these crypto trading bots. Read on to understand why we chose these to be the best crypto trading bots as the top options in 2024. 5 Dominate bull or bear markets with tireless bots tailored to hunt success with Short, Long, and Futures positions, powered by professional-grade signals from TradingView and the 3Commas marketplace. 3Commas is a multifaceted automated crypto trading platform offering a range of crypto trading bots, including Dollar Cost Averaging, GRID, and Signal trading bot that can execute highly complex crypto trading strategies to match any traders goals, from a beginner to a professional funds manager.  5 Touted as the “world’s most customizable crypto trading software,” CryptoHopper is known for working closely with exchanges and regulators to maintain their members’ trust. Accounts are also guarded by industry-leading security protocols, and no user data is shared without permission. The highlight of Cryptohopper is its easy-to-use and customizable grid trading bot. CryptoHopper is also considered thebest AI Trading Botfor crypto with its AI strategy designer. The AI trading bot is designed to help all levels of traders to get started with crypto bot trading. Besides offering a safe environment, you can also look forward to several benefits. The site’s automated crypto trading bot outperforms humans, allowing you to trade like a professional without actually being one. You can also leverage pro tools, connect to the world’s top exchanges, and win prizes during crypto trading tournaments.  4.9 ArbitrageScanner.iois the best crypto trading bot according to the editorial staff and all users who already earn from 5-50% of capital per month using the service. It is the only scanner in the world that supports DEX, and most importantly – it supports Spot + Futures, Futures + Futures, Futures + Spot arbitrage – the lowest risk and most profitable crypto trading strategies, where the most money is now. What is the advantage of the strategy and how do you work with the Arbitrage Perpetuals tool? You know that the price of futures changes faster than the price of spot – so you make money by equalizing the price between spot and futures, or futures and futures, as well as by charging a funding rate. The simplest strategy: go short with isolated leverage 1x more expensive → buy on the spot cheaper → earn upto $100000+ in a month like the clients of the service. This is one of the easiest options you can use. Let’s show the case of ArbitrageScanner.io client where he made over $1,700 on STRK token using Spot + Features strategy. He followed the spreads on STRK coin and was informed that the spread was 1.5% between OKX spot and OKX futures on Bybit. The client then bought the STRK token on the spot → opened a 1x short on the same volume → waited for the spot and futures prices to converge. The profit was $1500 in 40 minutes and further the client received income from funding every 8 hours (funding rate is more than 0.2%). This is the most stable way of earning, where if you follow certain rules you will not have any losses. Arbitrage Scanner also offers free training using specific cases. Users also get access to a private chat room with a strong crypto community where participants share their working strategies, cases and market insights. These are not high-risk automated trading bots – with Arbitrage Scanner you get access to working arbitrage tools, on-chain analysis, free training, profitable cases, strong community – thanks to which clients choose this service and have already multiplied their capital.  4.8 In the trading bot crypto scene, Pionex stands out because it offers free crypto trading bots. You also don’t need any prior knowledge of crypto or automated trading to get started. Among Asia’s fastest-growing crypto platforms, it offers custom automated tactics for beginners and experienced traders alike.

Other perks include low fees, high security, large-volume trading, support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, and no minimum deposit for the free trading bot.  4.6 Bitget makes it easier for experienced quant traders to connect their own trading algorithms by integrating APIs with specific data feeds. With Bitget trading bots, you can use an intuitive user interface (UI) that abstracts away technical complexity to program trading bots to respond to various indicators such as volume metrics, price movements, RSI, and more. Template trading bots for common trade automation strategies such as Grid trading bot, Dollar Cost Averaging, and TWAP are readily available for quick live deployment and basic customization.  4.5 Etoro is slightly different as it doesn’t have a bot trading program. You also cannot use trading bots on the platform.

Market making bots provide liquidity by placing limit orders, while arbitrage trading bots exploit price discrepancies across multiple exchanges. Technical analysis bots execute trades based on predefined indicators, and AI-powered trading bots use machine learning to adapt strategies based on market conditions.

Performance metrics and trading strategies customization options are also critical factors. Always look for the bots that offer backtesting capabilities, allowing you to test trading strategies with historical data. Evaluate the flexibility of the bot’s trading strategies and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. One of the most important considerations is the price structure of the bot, such as subscription plans, transaction fees, and any additional costs.

Essentially, they are giveaways from cryptocurrency projects to their loyal and engaged audience.Upcoming crypto airdropsbenefit both users, who receive free digital assets, and projects, which gain increased visibility and user engagement. We have compiled an extensive list of over 40+ upcomingbest airdrops to invest in. These projects invite new users to join their communities, rewarding them with free tokens in exchange for completing simple tasks. Finding the top upcoming airdrops is tricky. Projects often release drip-fed information to create a buzz, while social media is a wildfire of misinformation. Below, we’ve researched, collated, and confirmed the best airdrops coming up. You’ll find details about each project, the status of the drop, and how to qualify for the free coins. Etherfi is disrupting the Ethereum staking landscape with its approach to non-custodial liquid staking. Its $23 million series A funding, coupled with strong community support and fast expansion, is making the DeFi world sit up and take notice. One unique feature is its use of NFTs for validators participating in the staking mechanism to strengthen the independence and safety of stakers. Adding to this, the project is integrated with EigenLayer to improve yield for staking rewards. This gives users extra investment flexibility with staking to avoid locking up their assets. The platform operates two cryptocurrencies – eETH for the use of restaking and the $ETHFI governance token, the latter of which is regularly airdropped. EtherFi regularly runs airdrop rounds known as Seasons. Season 3 kicked off in mid-September 2024 and is likely to be followed by a season 4 in 2025 after the huge success of previous airdrops. EtherFI is proposing to run seasondrops every 4 months. If this retains community support then the next EtherFI airdrop looks set to start in January 2025. To be eligible for Etherfi, you must: TapSwap is a viral Telegram game running on the Ton Blockchain. The mini-app rewards users for their gameplay and interaction with the platform. The game has so far logged over 68 million users and 4+ trillion taps since its February 2024 launch! Its simple and engaging mechanics allow anyone with a phone to start earning real rewards. You don’t need to be a ‘crypto tech wizard’ to enjoy this project. Following in the footsteps of the much-hyped Hamster Kombat, TapSwap is the next GameFi platform set to launch and distribute its native token. Expected to drop in late October 2024, $TAPS has a predicted initial valuation of $0.03 – $0.06 that could put its market valuation at around $800 million. $TAPS is the next hot ticket on the blockchain. Although the exact date is being kept secret, all the hype and excitement right now is pointing towards the end of October. So, the race is on for gamers to collect coins in the game in the hope of being rewarded for their early participation. Along with handing out free TAPs, it is expected to launch on major cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously with the airdrop. It’s certainly one to watch. Founder Naz Ventura has confirmed the TapSwap airdrop with announcements that it will likely occur before October 30, 2024. Although, the exact date is being kept secret. A recent tweet from the officialTapSwap X account teased,“We know you’re eagerly waiting for the DATE.” What exactly is TapSwap cooking up for the drop? We don’t know exactly, but something’s bubbling away. TapSwap will likely reward its historical users, particularly those who have already built up the biggest coin rewards within the platform. So, if you want to earn free TAPS from the drop, it’s best to start playing the game as soon as possible. SupraOracles works to bridge gaps between blockchain and real-world data. This is an important function for the development of the way smart contracts and dApps work. SupraOracles opens up a new world of opportunities for developers to build blockchain applications that interact with real-world events. With improved Oracle infrastructure industries such as supply chain management and finance could be revolutionized. The project has raised more than $24 million in investment, including prominent VCs such as Coinbase Ventures. The Oracles are already in operation with major blockchains like Aptos, Ethereum, Avalanche, and dozens more. GameFi airdrops seem to be all the rage right now, but SupraOracles is gearing up for something altogether more serious. As a potential build-block of the DeFi industry for years to come, getting hold of the $SUPRA coin through its likely 2024 airdrop is a wise move. It will be used to facilitate payments for data and uses for staking. So there’s room for future passive earnings on this one. The $SUPRA supply is set at 10 billion – 21.65% of which is reserved for community incentives. The $SUPRA airdrop isopen right nowwith no set deadlines. With no set finish date, it is unclear when the airdrop will close. Here’s how to qualify for the SupraOracles airdrop: You can join the‘Countdown to Blast Off‘ on the official website and start completing tasks to earn $SUPRA including a 1000 instant bonus. If there are two things the crypto world loves it’s meme coins and airdrops. So it’s unsurprising that a project named MemeFi is another mouthwatering 2024 airdrop. MemeFi is another growing Telegram play-to-earn (P2E) game fusing DeFi and meme culture together. The game pits players in meme-themed battles to earn coins, along with bonuses for daily activity, social media challenges, and video codes. The official MemeFi coin is preparing for launch on October 30, 2024. $MEMEFI is going live in its Token Generation Event (TGE) when it will be listed on 6 major crypto exchanges. Simultaneously, it will be dropped to eligible users. The development team is working to build tokenomics with longevity and engagement in mind. So users can expect the following distribution: News of the $MEMEFI launch and airdrop date was confirmed via the MemeFi CommunityTelegram channel. Plus, news on the eligibility and launch has also been reported bymajor trading exchange KuCoin. Here’s how to be eligible for MemeFi: GameFi is dominating the airdrop cryptocurrency scene right now and X Empire is another top airdrop of 2024. It’s an innovative financial strategy game, formerly called Musk Empire. It’s an ‘Elon Musk-themed’ tap-to-earn game that is similar to the massively popular Hamster Kombat. It’s simple to play, requiring the user to tap on in-game images to earn coins and build their empire. Then players can invest their earnings to build passive income when not playing. A unique feature of the game is a battle function where you Rock, Paper, and Scissors against other players. Plus, you can invest in in-game stock each day in the hopes of growing further rewards. During the X Empire airdrop, the team plans to distribute 75% of the total supply. This will be around 517.5 billion $X out of the 690 billion total supply. While the rest is reserved for future game phases and new users. Distribution is linked to player engagement in several tasks, including referrals, profits generated, and quest completions. The developers are promising fair distribution so that the users contributing to the community and investing their time are “generously rewarded”. Theofficial telegram channel announcedthat the X Empire launch was set for October, which has since been confirmed as October 24 2024. This has since beenconfirmed by multiple sources,including leading crypto exchange Bitget. Here’s how to be eligible for the X Empire airdrop: Following the steps above will help you prepare and maximize your $X airdropped tokens. Berachain is a high-performance, innovative blockchain using proof-of-liquidity PoL) to separate gas from governance tokens, plus calculate rewards based on liquidity provided. It aims to encourage use to provide liquidity to DeFi apps and build unity between project ecosystems and validators. The developers launched the public Testnet in June 2024 with the mainnet expected to launch by the end of 2024. It is one of the most hyped crypto projects of the year, with some wondering if $BERA could one day challenge Ether and Solana’s dominance. The PoL consensus mechanism could be an enhancement for rewarding validators compared to traditional PoS methods, especially when paired with high scalability and a multi-token ecosystem. While EVM compatibility with the current Ethereum application will make it easy for developers to make the jump. If it did become a significant competitor to the likes of Ethereum and Solana, then getting on the airdrop is a huge incentive for investors. Concrete news of a Berachain airdrop is yet to appear, although if the mainnet does launch late in 2024, then we could be gearing up for a drop in 2025. Adding to this, there are rumors of leaked criteria to get ahead of any future eligibility requirements. Here’s how to improve the chance of eligibility for the Berachain airdrop: Blum is taking a unique approach to building a user base for its DeFi platform. What started as a P2E game has now shifted into plans for a DEX with every coin you need in one place. From classic coins to meme coins, L2 cryptos. To help distribute $BLUM and make an enjoyable experience, the team has integrated a GameFi platform. To get the most out of the airdrop, users need to start participating in the Blum Telegram app to earn B points. Points can be earned through completing tasks, playing the ‘Drop game’, and inviting friends. Of course, the more you earn, the more you’ll be dropped when the time comes for the official launch. Early participants receive 1 $BLUM for every 3.5 Blum points. Price predictions have estimated the $BLUM to be valued anywhere between $0.15 and $0.60. The app initially launched in June 2024, but the precise airdrop date is yet to be revealed. Many believe it will be towards the end of 2024. For date confirmations keep a close eye on the officialTelegram channel. Here’s how to be eligible for the Blum airdrop: Following the steps above will help you prepare and maximize your $BLUM during the initial airdrop. Did you know Sony has developed a blockchain called Soneium? It’s a layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum to provide developers with a cost-effective and fast environment. It is working to bring Web 3 use into everyday life with leverage from Sony’s diverse $1.7 billion annual business operations. Soneium has made some notable Web3 partnerships, including Astar Network, Alchemy, Circle, Optimism, Chainlink, and The Graph, for its development and launch. Those are serious operators in the blockchain world so there are a lot of eyes on this project right now. The network is suitable for finance, entertainment, and gaming which has recently launched its Minato Testnet in September 2024. With the testnet live, this is sparking a buzz around a possible $SONY airdrop for adopters and testers. Plus, the Soneium Spark program is incentivizing developers with funding upto $100,000. There hasn’t been any official word on airdrops, but many airdrop farmers are hedging their bets anyway. If there is a future $SONY airdrop, then it’s not one you want to miss out on. So you help your chances by being an early adopter. Here’s how to start using the Testnet in the hope of an airdrop: Speculation about Major Coin has been growing rapidly in recent weeks, particularly as the game is gaining traction with Telegram users. The P2E game requires players to collect stars while engaging in the community for potential distribution. It is designed to be fun, social, and competitive gameplay as users compete to become the Major. The native $MAJOR coin is designed to support and reward players along with ensuring the growth of the game. 80% of the supply is reserved for the community as a commitment to player satisfaction and engagement. 60% of that is for current player rewards and the other 20% for future community incentives. The final 20% is for marketing and development funds along with liquidity. Competitive gameplay coupled with a strong outline for incentive-led tokenomics is exciting for many players. Exchange listing dates have yet to be announced, but this airdrop could well be coming late in 2024, so it’s worth participating in the game as soon as possible to get your share. Confirmation of when the airdrop will occur is still missing. The development team continues torelease more information on the tokenomicsand dev plans. The airdrop is tipped by many to occur in November 2024. Key activities to be eligible for the Major airdrop include: Since 2022, there have been constant whispers about a potential Metamask airdrop. Metamask is the most popular Ethereum wallet and dApp browser extension. It has more than 100 million users and 30 million active monthly users. Given its user base and status in the crypto landscape, the prospect of an airdrop commands serious attention. Metamask doesn’t yet have a native cryptocurrency or blockchain. Consensys is the development company behind MetaMask. In 2022, the founder, Joe Lubic, announced plans to release a native coin that would come in tandem with a MetaMask DAO. The lead of operations at the firm echoed this news. So a coin launch appears to be in the development roadmap but the community is still awaiting further updates. If it does, then there is a clear possibility an airdrop could be used to distribute the supply to the most loyal, long-term users of MetaMask. If you needed a reason to start using a MetaMask wallet, then this could be it! The MetaMask airdrop is purely speculative currently. Confirmation of $MASK developmentcame in 2022 from Consensys,but there have been no updates since then. To give yourself the best opportunity to be eligible for a $MASK airdrop, you should: A crypto airdrop is a process where a cryptocurrency project gives away free coins to active community members. Early adopters and investors in a project are sent cryptocurrency directly into their wallets as a reward for supporting the project. Airdrops serve several reasons, including distributing tokens, marketing and awareness, and encouraging usage. Multiple styles of airdrop now exist, but generally, to be eligible, you must complete a set of actions or be a historical user of the project. Here are the airdrop variations you can expect to find: You might be wondering why on earth companies would just give away free cryptocurrency, especially when you hear numbers like Uniswap airdropping more than $6 billion worth of UNI. It sounds like a strange move but there are strategic reasons for projects to reward users in this way. Everybody loves free stuff, especially free money, even if it’s the crypto kind. So a giveaway is a quick and easy way to generate excitement and buzz around a new project. For new cryptocurrencies, it’s an efficient and cost-effective way to get people talking about your project. Companies leverage this further by using the airdrop to incentivize people to share the information and invite friends to join in. Airdrops enable the distribution of a new cryptocurrency to thousands or millions of users instantly. An example of this is Hamster Kombat, which became the largest-ever airdrop in 2024. It distributed 6 billion free tokens to 50 million users which instantly gave the cryptocurrency a $500 million market cap. Distributing crypto between a wide user base helps to ensure decentralization. This makes sure the controlling power is distributed between a broad array of users. This is particularly important for governance and Proof-of-stake networks where protocol decisions and security are directly in the hands of coin holders. Airdrops help build community and engagement with a project. Often, to be eligible, users must learn educational material and be active members of a community. This helps get more people involved and build a robust following for a project. Giving away free cryptocurrency rewards users for their commitment to a project. This incentivizes users to be loyal, engage regularly, and participate in the ecosystem. Without an incentive, it can be hard for projects to attract users in such a competitive crypto landscape. This is important as early users are crucial for product testing, feedback, and development alongside community building and marketing efforts. Before you get started chasing down project drops, let’s quickly run through how it all works so understand the steps usually required to be eligible. If you fancy becoming a regular ‘airdrop hunter’ then you need to know the best places to look for the next airdrop. Some projects announce details widely while others like to keep details secret among community members. Crypto airdrops are an innovative marketing strategy that works to grow a new project and reward users directly. Marketing strategy is no longer a one-sided affair where a company simply looks to extract value from customers. Instead, the crypto community has found a way to generate buzz about a product or platform while also giving tangible value to customers. They are also recognized as a way to quickly create decentralization of a cryptocurrency and distribute a token to stimulate its wide use and acceptance. Finding the best airdrops can take a little patience. Often, details are kept secret, or projects are distributed with little notice to ensure long-term loyal users are rewarded most heavily. Crypto projects of all shapes and sizes use this distribution method, especially when it comes to GameFi, where developers need to build a large user base to ensure the longevity of play to earn gaming. Plus, many of the biggest crypto airdrops like Uniswap have delivered huge giveaways in the past. Many hope that wallet pioneers MetaMask will follow suit in the coming years. If you’re ready to start hunting down upcoming airdrops then start using community and forum apps like Telegram and Discord. Plus, set up alerts and check this page regularly for the top picks. Table of content The majority of cryptocurrencies now do airdrops but they happen quickly and change regularly. You should look for new projects in development that are set to launch in the upcoming months. Users are rewarded for being loyal users of a platform, so to get airdrop, you’ll need to register your wallet with a project and perform a predetermined set of tasks, including sharing on social media, inviting friends, and holding tokens. You can find upcoming potential airdrops on project social accounts and related community forums. Plus, check major crypto news sources and specialist airdrop alert websites. Hamster Kombat is thought to be the biggest ever airdrop. In September 2024, it distributed 60 billion HMSTR tokens to 131 million users. In terms of real-world value, Uniswap holds the record for distributing $6.43 billion in free money with $UNI in September 2020. Yes, airdrops do really work. They are an instant way to distribute a cryptocurrency to thousands or millions of users. In return, users are happy to engage in a platform, use the coin or token, and spread buzz around a new project. CoinGape prepared areview methodologyto rate crypto exchanges, tools, and apps.

    "news_content": "SIRWIN Bets.io Ybets A type of digital asset known as cryptocurrency relies on a network that is dispersed among numerous computers. They are able to exist independently of governments and other central authorities thanks to their decentralized nature. Many industries, including finance and law, are expected to be disrupted by blockchain technology, according to some experts. Cheaper and quicker money transactions, as well as decentralized systems that do not have a single point of failure, are two benefits of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies’ drawbacks include their unstable prices, high energy requirements for mining, and use in illegal activities. The digital currency known as cryptocurrency is decentralized, based onblockchain technology, and encrypted. Blockchain, decentralization, and cryptography are the first three concepts that one must comprehend in order to understand cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that only authorized users have access to in the context of cryptocurrencies. This ledger contains transactions involving a variety of assets, including cash, real estate, and even intellectual property. Each user has equal access, and all information exchanged is immediate, transparent, and “immutable.” Anything that is recorded on a blockchain that is immutable cannot be changed or tampered with, not even by the administrator. The term “centralized money” refers to the conventional currency we employ and is controlled by institutions like the Reserve Bank of India. Because cryptocurrencies are decentralized, no similar organization can be held accountable for monitoring the growth and decline of a specific cryptocurrency. Comparing this to centralized money has several advantages. Data is protected from unauthorized access using encryption techniques incryptography. Cryptography enables the majority of blockchain’s claims, including immutability and anonymity. The creation of a “blinding algorithm” in the 1980s is credited with giving cryptocurrency technology its beginnings. Digital transactions that are secure and unchangeable are the core of the algorithm. It continues to be crucial to the contemporary digital currency. The founding ideas ofBitcoin, the first and most popular cryptocurrency on the market today, were developed in 2008 by a group of individuals who are now known only by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was introduced to the globe in 2009. But it would take years before it was legally accepted as a payment method by well-known retailers, with WordPress being the first to do so in 2012. Currently, banks, insurance, and other corporate sectors employ the underlying blockchain technology. The market for cryptocurrencies is expected to reach $4.94 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 12.8% since 2021 because of the need to strengthen the effectiveness of current payment systems, the rise in international remittances, and the rising requirement to secure data.  Understanding the different types of cryptocurrencies is crucial because there are so many of them available. A cryptocurrency without a purpose is likely to be riskier than one with utility, so finding out if the coin you’re looking at has a purpose will help you decide whether it’s worth investing in. When you hear about different types of cryptocurrencies, you typically hear the coin’s name. Coin kinds are distinct from coin names, though. With some of the tokens in that category, you might encounter the following types: Governments and other central regulatory bodies do not have jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency, as a concept, operates outside of the banking system using several brands or types of coins, with Bitcoin serving as the main participant. Cryptocurrencies are devised through a process known as “mining,” which is entirely digital. This procedure is intricate. In essence, miners get paid with bitcoins in exchange for using specialized computer systems to solve specific mathematical riddles. In an ideal environment, mining one bitcoin would take just ten minutes, but in practice, it typically takes about thirty days. Today, users can sell cryptocurrencies to them or purchase them via brokers, exchanges, and private currency owners. The simplest ways to purchase or sell cryptocurrencies are through exchanges or online marketplaces like Coinbase. Cryptocurrencies can be kept in digital wallets after purchase. You can have “hot wallet” or “cold” digital wallets. Hot refers to a wallet that is online-connected, making transactions simple but leaving it open to fraud and theft. On the other side, cold storage is safer but makes transactions more difficult. The transfer of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins between digital wallets is simple and requires only a smartphone. Once you have them, you have the option to: a) Spend them on products or services b) Sell them. b) Sell them for cash. The simplest way to make purchases with Bitcoin is throughCrypto debit-cardtransactions. These debit cards allow you to make cash withdrawals just like at an ATM. Using banking accounts or peer-to-peer transactions, it is also feasible to convert cryptocurrencies to cash. Due to significant investment losses as a consequence of frauds, hacks, and vulnerabilities, cryptocurrencies have developed a reputation as unstable investments. Although the underlying encryption is typically secure, new users may be seriously endangered by the technical difficulties of utilizing and holding crypto assets. Investors in cryptocurrencies should be aware of the following risks in addition to the market risks connected with speculative assets: Despite these dangers, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has increased to more than $1 trillion. Despite the asset’s speculative nature, individuals have made significant fortunes by accepting the risk of investing in nascent cryptocurrencies. In recent years, Tesla and other major corporations have considered embracing Bitcoin. Major brands, on the other hand, frequently abandon the idea after a short while. It is difficult to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a practical, day-to-day manner because of their inherent value instability. El Salvador’s government became the first to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021. As a result, taxpayers ought to be able to pay taxes and other governmental services using Bitcoin.

    "news_content": "SIRWIN Bets.io Ybets There is rarely anyone who is not familiar with the name of the world’s richest person Elon Musk. The 51-year-old business magnate and the CEO of Tesla were recently in the news after he proposed his desire to acquire microblogging and social networking platform Twitter. However, later Musk reversed his decision and is currently fighting a lawsuit with Twitter owner Jack Dorsey on that deal. Regarding cryptocurrencies, Elon Musk has shown his support for various digital coins such as Dogecoin and others. Musk has too many followers on social media platforms, and a single tweet by him gets widespread coverage in media channels distributed across the world. With a net worth of approximately $228 billion, Elon Musk has held the title of the world’s richest person since January 2021. Past precedents show that a single tweet by a billionaire on cryptocurrencies can push up the price of those crypto coins. For example, at some point last year, the cost of Shiba Inu appeared to jump after Musk constantly posted pictures of his Shiba Inu puppy on Twitter. To get the latest updates about Elon Musk’s price-sensitive tweets, stay tuned on Coingape.

    "news_content": "SIRWIN Bets.io Ybets El Salvador, the smallest country in Central America, became the first country in the world to use Bitcoin as a legal tender after being adopted by the El Salvador Legislative Assembly in 2021. El Salvador’s congress approved President Nayib Bukele’s resolution to make Bitcoin a legal currency in June last year. Nayib Bukele, a tech-savvy millennial who had been a proponent of the digital currency’s adoption, believed that cryptocurrency would make it faster and cheaper to get remittances from abroad. He also argued thatcryptocurrencycould free the indebted nation from the grip of the traditional global financial system. The acceptance of Bitcoin as a legal tender in the country will allow the usage of digital currency in any transaction, from buying a pizza to paying taxes. Reaction to El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender: The aggressive move, primarily supported and celebrated by the global Bitcoin community, has attracted more skepticism at home and in the traditional financial world amidst concerns that it could invite instability and undue risk to the country’s fragile economy. Meanwhile, in El Salvador, many viewed the decision with distrust and confusion. They were scared that the volatility inherent to virtual tokens could be dangerous for the economy — and their savings. Moreover, international financial bodies, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), maintained that adopting Bitcoin could make the country vulnerable to money laundering and other illicit financial activity. A year after the bitcoin’s adoption, economic surveys have revealed that cryptocurrency was not used widely in El Salvador, mainly due to a lack of digital literacy. A study by the US National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) revealed that 20% of people who downloaded Chivo (a digital wallet that the government launched to promote Bitcoin) did not use their $30 sign-on bonus, while 61% of Chivo users stopped using the Chivo app after spending their reward. Besides, only an estimated 20% of businesses accept payment in bitcoin.

    "news_content": "SIRWIN Bets.io Ybets TRENDING TODAY Highlights The spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to hit new milestones every passing day as they surpass 1 million BTC holdings within just 10 days of launch. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has delivered formidable performance and has been at the forefront of the majority of inflows happening over the past few weeks. On Wednesday, October 30, the spot Bitcoin ETF inflows stood at a staggering $893 million, thereby making it the second-largest daily inflow ever since inception in January 2024. However, if we see,BlackRock’s IBITalone saw more than $ 870 million in inflows while taking its total inflows to more than $25.5 billion since inception. Yesterday was also the biggest-ever daily inflow for IBIT. Following yesterday’s development, the total number of Bitcoins held across all nine US spot ETFs surged past the 1 million milestone. Pretty apropos that the biggest daily inflow ever for$IBITis what pushed the US spot ETFs over the 1 million bitcoin held mark..https://t.co/6RuTzdacIs — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas)October 31, 2024  Nate Geraci, a prominent ETF analyst, shared an impressive update on the momentum behind the iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). Geraci noted that IBIT gathered more capital in a single day than all but seven of the 590+ ETFs launched in 2024 have accumulated throughout the entire year. The inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs show that institutional players are already building huge positions. Bloomberg ETF strategist Eric Balchunas said that both retail and institutional players have been buying the BTC ETFs in recent times. He wrote: “it started mostly retail but increasingly advisors institutions, which hold like 20% of shares out now but prob reach 40% within a year”. The recent developments happen when theUS election resultsare less than a week from now with prediction markets betting on a Donald Trump victory. On the other hand, big players like MicroStrategy have been turning bullish while disclosing their plans to buy additionalBitcoins worth $42 billion. Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets said: “We see the $42 billion as ambitious but not unattainable. Ultimately, if Bitcoin goes higher, it’ll work out for them.” Also, theBitcoin priceis pretty close to hitting fresh all-time high levels and is currently trading around $72,200 levels. As the market gets more clarity about the US elections, it could propel BTC to fresh all-time highs in November while leading to further rallies ahead.
