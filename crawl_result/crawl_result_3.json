Characteristics include: For updated information on our index announcements, methodologies, index policies, index catalogues, reconstitution calendars and consultations, please visit ourGovernance page. Q&A View more The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) measures the performance of top digital assets. Characteristics include: The CoinDesk 20 Index launched on January 12, 2024 with a base date of October 4, 2022.  As the new digital asset class emerges, market participants and observers will need a new reference index to measure performance, invest, and trade. The CoinDesk 20 Index has been designed with liquidity, diversification benefits, and implementation in mind. This index is the reference for crypto and the new building block for investment products. Whatâs different about the CoinDesk 20 Index? The CoinDesk 20 Index is built for trading. The weighting caps promote diversification across all constituents, a feature investors can appreciate. CoinDesk Indices constructed the CoinDesk 20 to be the liquid, investable âunit of exposureâ to the digital asset class.  CoinDesk Indices has the longest digital asset index track record and powers the worldâs largest digital asset products. We serve class-leading asset managers, ETP issuers, exchanges, market-makers, custodians, and service providers. Our products include singletoken price references, multi-token broad-market and sector products, and systematic strategies. Our team has experience in traditional finance indexing, financial markets, derivatives, and, of course, crypto. The CoinDesk 20 index is built on our market-leading DACS taxonomy and is drawn from our broad CoinDesk Market Index, and is aimed at what the market needs for the next chapter: a reference and benchmark index of the top digital assets, designed for implementation at scale. The index is reconstituted and rebalanced quarterly based on a published schedule.  Once bitcoin becomes more traditionally accessible, we believe many investors will turn their attention from just bitcoin to seeking more diversified digital asset exposures with a certain balance between established constituents that may otherwise dominate returns with alternative sources that are liquid and robust. Accordingly, the intention behind the CoinDesk 20 is to have a 50/50 portfolio split with 50% bitcoin/ether (30% bitcoin and 20% ether) and then 50% in alts i.e., the other 18 assets.

Significant Downtrend  Neutral  Significant Uptrend The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) provides a USD-denominated reference rate for the spot price of Bitcoin (BTC). The index leverages real-time prices from multiple constituent exchanges to provide a representative spot price. Each constituent exchange is weighted proportionally to its trailing 24-hour liquidity with adjustments for price variance and inactivity. Given the potential for anomalies or manipulation at individual exchanges, constituent weights may dynamically adjust using CoinDesk Indices proprietary Constituent Weighting Adjustment Algorithm (CWAA). The algorithm is designed to calculate a real-time index that is an accurate and reliable reflection of the market price of each digital asset, using multi-sourced spot prices and dynamically reduce the weights of individual exchanges with lower liquidity, inactivity, and higher price variance.

The report touts strategies to connect people with financial tools, but the only mention of crypto refers to its risks â a contrast to Kamala Harris' positive tone on the camp... Better Markets is using Polymarket's \"French connection\" as ammo against the prediction market's regulated competitor. The U.S. SEC chair has arguably been the individual with the greatest influence over the direction of America's crypto policies, but his days atop the agency are numbered. Chris Larsen has donated more than $11 million to the vice president's election effort, sending millions worth of the crypto token to the Democratic super PAC Future Forward,... A note from Kalshi's market research team suggests the prediction market - polls gap can be explained by Harris' sliding popularity with key demographics. The former president deserves credit for making crypto a campaign issue. We wish his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would say more about it. The WLFI token sale will be open for everyone who has been qualified through the project's whitelist. His odds of winning the U.S. presidential election have soared to a more than two-month high. With a month to go before Election Day, Kalshi and Interactive Brokers have listed prediction markets on the race for the White House. The former minister called on Beijing to study the industry in light of Republican candidate Donald Trump's comments on crypto. The latest Harris Poll look at U.S. voters shows more than half want crypto-informed candidates, and a separate analysis argues crypto voters could be a force in 2024. Crypto-fan candidate Bernie Moreno has caught up in Ohio polls as the industry's cash outpaces other PACs in one of the key U.S. Senate races that may decide the majority. Senior campaign officials are meeting with a select group of crypto insiders to hash out policy concerns, but those in the discussions aren't expecting a big splash before the... The Democratic nominee promises she'll be a tech-friendly president in remarks to donors. A federal appeals court will consider the CFTC's ongoing efforts to keep political prediction markets from launching. The agency appealed a lower court's decision to let the firm offer prediction markets on which party will control each house of Congress. Crypto firms are watching the case. The U.S. derivatives regulator's legal battle with the prediction markets is currently winding its way through an appeals court. Trumpâs new DeFi project may fail, as many do, but its launch, coming in the midst of a presidential campaign, is further proof that crypto has entered the mainstream, says Gr... While the industry was not mentioned in the party's manifesto or on the campaign trail, Labour has said it will support tokenization and a central bank digital currency. The U.K. is set to hold its first election in five years on Thursday and crypto is not a campaign-trail issue. The election results are not expected to have much of an impact on South Africa's crypto industry. A U.K. election is expected to happen this year, but it likely won't change the trajectory of the country's crypto policy efforts. Any plans for comprehensive crypto legislation could be kicked further down the road after a weaker-than-forecast showing for the governing party. Expectations were low for a change in the stiff taxes on crypto transactions: a 30% tax on profits and a 1% TDS on all transactions. Cryptoâs significance as an election issue remains non-existent or at best negligible. France, Austria, Germany and other countries are expected to have elections soon, following this month's European Parliament contest. Centrist parties hold power, but a right-wing majority is active on polarizing issues. The crypto industry needs to choose what it stands for, and with whom it wants to work,... Among the MEPs retaining their seats is Stefan Berger, who steered the landmark MiCA legislation. The French president called a snap election after an unexpectedly poor showing in voting for the European Parliament. As much as a third of the prediction market's volume is inflated by traders acting as the buyer and seller â an illegal practice in TradFi â on the same trades, Fortune report... âThe crypto voter is already a force to be reckoned with, but it will continue to grow,â CEO Brian Armstrong said. The report touts strategies to connect people with financial tools, but the only mention of crypto refers to its risks â a contrast to Kamala Harris' positive tone on the camp... Bitcoin's \"bullish setup\" into the U.S. election next week mirrors late 2020, which preceded a 120% rally in two months, Matthew Sigel of VanEck said. Elections in Georgia were more focused on whether or not the country should align further with the European Union or Russia. Better Markets is using Polymarket's \"French connection\" as ammo against the prediction market's regulated competitor. The former president's probability of retaking the White House slid to 59% Wednesday before rebounding. The Kentucky lawmaker is running to succeed crypto-advocate Patrick McHenry as chair of the powerful U.S. House Financial Services Committee. The U.S. SEC chair has arguably been the individual with the greatest influence over the direction of America's crypto policies, but his days atop the agency are numbered. Chris Larsen has donated more than $11 million to the vice president's election effort, sending millions worth of the crypto token to the Democratic super PAC Future Forward,... Several prospective issuers have filed to launch exchange-traded funds tracking smaller coins like Ripple's XRP or Solana (SOL), but the trajectory of those applications may l... If you think the Trump bulls are wrong, bet against them. In just three weeks, Kalshi's presidential prediction market has passed $30M in volume. It still trails the $2 billion traded on Polymarket since January. Republican control of the Senate would be key to passing bills such as FIT21 and appointing pro-crypto agency leaders, and digital asset reform would likely happen sooner with... The regulator filed its opening brief in its appeals case to tamp down on political event contracts. A note from Kalshi's market research team suggests the prediction market - polls gap can be explained by Harris' sliding popularity with key demographics. The former president deserves credit for making crypto a campaign issue. We wish his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would say more about it. The vice president touted her \"opportunity agenda\" but did not drill down on what it would mean for digital assets during an appearance in Erie, Pa.

    "news_title": "Why the SEC Lawsuit Against Consensys May Hold Little Ground - Unchained",
    "news_content": "Past rulings, such as the Coinbase and Binance cases, undermine the allegations made by Gary Genslerâs agency in its lawsuit against Consensys. Listen to the episode onApple Podcasts,Spotify,Pods,Fountain,Overcast,Podcast Addict,Pocket Casts,Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform. In this episode, crypto lawyers Kayvan Sadeghi and Sam Enzer delve into the SECâs lawsuit against Consensys, which focuses on MetaMaskâs swaps and staking services, and explore the implications of the SECâs stance on MetaMask acting as a broker-dealer, and the classification of its staking product as a security. They discuss how recent rulings on Coinbase and Binance challenge the SECâs claims, and whether differing judicial opinions could lead to the Supreme Court. Also, they talk about the potential impact of the Supreme Court striking down Chevron deference for crypto regulation.

    "news_content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $72,277.68 today, as of Oct 31 06:35 a.m., with a 24-hour trading volume of $42.41B. Over the last 24 hours, the price has decreased by -0.17%. Bitcoin currently has a circulating supply of 19.78M and a market cap of $1.43T. Bitcoin (BTC) is the worldâs first decentralized cryptocurrency â a type of digital asset that usespublic-key cryptographyto record, sign and send transactions over the Bitcoinblockchainâ all done without the oversight of a central authority. TheBitcoinnetwork (with an upper-case âBâ) was launched in January 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym âSatoshi Nakamoto.â The network is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that uses a cryptocurrency called bitcoin (lower case âbâ) to transfer value over the internet or act as a store of value like gold and silver. Each bitcoin is made up of 100 millionsatoshis(the smallest units of bitcoin), making individual bitcoin divisible up to eight decimal places. That means anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar. Bitcoin (BTC) price Bitcoinâs price is renowned for being highly volatile, but despite that, it has become thetop performing assetof any class (including stocks, commodities and bonds) over the past decade â climbing a staggering 9,000,000% between 2010 and 2020. When the cryptocurrency was launched at the beginning of 2009, as Satoshi Nakamoto mined the bitcoin genesis block (the first-ever block on the Bitcoin blockchain), 50 BTC entered circulation at a price of $0.00. Fifty bitcoin continued to enter circulation every block (created once every 10 minutes) until the first halving event took place in November 2012 (see below). Halvings refer to bitcoinâs issuance system, which was programmed into Bitcoinâs code by Satoshi Nakamoto. It essentially involves automatically halving the number of new BTC entering circulation every 210,000 blocks. In February 2011, BTCâs price reached parity with the U.S dollar for the first time. The milestone encouraged new investors into the market, and over the next four months, bitcoinâs price in USD continued to rise â peaking at over $30. By early 2013, the leading cryptocurrency had recovered from a prolonged bearish episode and rose above $1,000, albeit only briefly. But with the infamousMt Gox hack, China announcing its first ban on crypto and other situations, it took a further four years for the BTC price to return to above $1,000 again. Once that level was passed, however, bitcoinâs price continued to surge dramatically throughout 2017 until BTC peaked at its previouslong-standing all-time high of $19,850. Over 2018, the entire crypto market plunged into what is now known as the âcrypto winterâ â a yearlong bear market. It wasnât until December 2020, when bitcoin returned to test the previous all-time high, that it eventually surpassed that historical level and rose a further 239% over the next 119 days to a new all-time high of $64,799.

    "news_title": "Ethereum Price | ETH Price and Live Chart - CoinDesk",
    "news_content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) is $2,647.44 today, as of Oct 31 06:35 a.m., with a 24-hour trading volume of $22.04B. Over the last 24 hours, the price has decreased by -0.90%. Ethereum currently has a circulating supply of 120.41M and a market cap of $318.77B. Ethereumis a blockchain-based software platform that can be used for sending and receiving value globally with its native cryptocurrency, ether, without any third-party interference. But it can also do much more than that. First proposed in 2013 by Russian-Canadian computer programmerVitalik Buterin, Ethereum was designed to expand the utility of cryptocurrencies by allowing developers to create their own special applications. Unlike traditional apps, these Ethereum-based applications, called âdecentralized applications,â or dapps, are self-executing thanks to the use of smart contracts. Smart contracts are code-based programs that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain and automatically carry out certain functions when predetermined conditions are met. That can be anything from sending a transaction when a certain event takes place or loaning funds once collateral is deposited into a designated wallet. The smart contracts form the basis of all dapps built on Ethereum, as well as all other dapps created across other blockchain platforms. Ether price In August 2014, Ethereum launched its native token, ether, through aninitial coin offering(ICO). Some 50 million ETHs were sold at a price of $0.31 per coin, raising over $16 million for the project. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereumâs cryptocurrency has an unbounded supply, meaning there is no limit to how many ether can enter circulation. According to the projectâsofficial website,the annual inflation rate of ether is about 4.5%. Block rewards have been reduced two times since the first ever Ethereum block was mined. That block is known as the genesis block. The reductions in block rewards arenât programmed into Ethereumâs code like Bitcoinâs halving events are. Instead, members of the community propose changes, called âEthereum Improvement Proposals,â or EIPs, and the rest of the community votes on whether to include the proposals in updates to Ethereumâs software code. Here is a breakdown of etherâs issuance schedule to date. The issuance rate is also affected by a feature known as the âdifficulty bomb.â This refers to a mechanism that increases the difficulty of mining on the original Ethereum blockchain (prior to the transition to the proof-of-stake Ethereum 2.0 blockchain. See below). Increasing mining difficulty lengthens the time it takes for miners to discover new blocks. That means less ether enters circulation in the form of block rewards, which in turn tapers overall issuance. This mechanism was activated, reset and delayed several times between 2017 and 2020, mainly because Ethereum developers needed more time to work on key updates ahead of the2.0 upgrade. From etherâs official launch date in 2014 to March 2017, the tokenâs price remained rangebound between $0.70 and $21. It wasnât until the 2017 bull crypto market started to pick up in May of that year that ETH price went above $100 for the first time. From there, ether skyrocketed to a peak of $414 in June 2017 before correcting. It took another five months for bullish momentum to regain strength. By that point, the entire crypto market was starting to experience huge buying pressure, which elevated almost every crypto token to new highs. By January 2018, ETHâs price peaked at $1,418 before it fell sharply. It took about three years for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap (behind bitcoin) to retest its previous all-time high price. Between February and May 2021, ethâs price more than tripled to set a new all-time high of $4,379.

    "news_title": "Price | BNB Price and Live Chart",
    "news_content": "The price of BNB (BNB) is $592.14 today, as of Oct 31 06:35 a.m., with a 24-hour trading volume of $803.06M. Over the last 24 hours, the price has decreased by -1.62%. BNB currently has a circulating supply of 145.89M and a market cap of $86.39B. Binance coin (BNB) is the exchange token of the Binance cryptoexchange. It was launched originally on theEthereumblockchain but later migrated to the Binance Smart Chain, now called BNB Chain.Holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange. That means demand for the token is linked to demand for the exchangeâs services. Therefore, buying BNB can be seen as a bet on the success of the exchange, in a similar way to buying a share in a company, except that owning the token comes with no ownership rights in the exchange. BNB price As of May 2022, BNBâs all-time highest price was $686.31, recorded on May 10, 2021, according to CoinGecko. The rally was likely to do with the surging popularity ofdecentralized applications(dapps), includingdecentralized finance(DeFi), on the Binance Smart Chain.Binance Smart Chain (later rebranded BNB Chain) is a layer 1 network, meaning other applications can be built on top of it. That makes it a competitor to the Ethereum network. It offers faster transactions and cheaper transaction speeds than Ethereum, but it is more centralized.The success of the BNB Chain contributes to rallies in the price of BNB because the token is needed to pay transaction fees on the chain. Anyone wanting to do business on the chain needs BNB tokens. In addition to its core centralized exchange, Binance has also built adecentralized exchangeon the BNB Chain.BNB spent much of 2021-22 as the third or fourth largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization. As of May 2022, it is the fourth largest afterbitcoin(BTC),ethereum(ETH) andtether(USDT).Binance originally created the tokens in order to raise capital through aninitial coin offering(ICO). The coins were sold in the first week of the ICO in July 2017 at a price of 2,700 BNB for 1 ETH. The offering included 100 million BNB, meaning at the top end it could have raised around 37,000 ETH, which would have been worth nearly $10 million at the time.The founding team and angel investors held another 100 million BNB between them. Binance proposed in its original whitepaper to spend 20% of its profits every quarter buying and removing BNB from circulation, until the volume was brought down to 100 million. As of May 2022, the volume in circulation is around 168 million BNB, according to CoinGecko.The process of removing tokens from circulation or âburningâ tends to support the price of a token, all else being equal.BNB tokens are burned in âreal time,â meaning all the time. A certain portion of transaction fees is burned whenever a block is validated. At the time of writing, the total burned in this way was just over 76,600 BNB. However, most BNB burning is done on a regular quarterly basis, with the amount calculated according to a formula based on the BNB price and the total number of blocks so far validated in the chain. In the first quarterly burn of 2022, more than 1.8 million BNB were burned. How does BNB work? Key events and management ABOUT CONTACT POLICIES",

    "news_content": "The price of Solana (SOL) is $175.03 today, as of Oct 31 06:35 a.m., with a 24-hour trading volume of $3.62B. Over the last 24 hours, the price has decreased by -2.65%. Solana currently has a circulating supply of 470.40M and a market cap of $82.33B. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain, a platform that has fast transaction times and inexpensive fees. What is Solana? Solana is ablockchainplatform designed to facilitatedecentralized app (dApp)development and support crypto-currency transactions. What sets Solana apart is its hybrid protocol system and unique timestamp technology, which is centered around a mechanism calledProof-of-History (PoH). This system creates a verifiable and secure timestamp for each transaction, which allows nodes to process transactions without needing to communicate with one another, significantly speeding up the transaction processing time. Solana utilizes a unique model, where PoH works in tandem with aProof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. PoH allows for the recording of the order of events and the time that has passed between them, which mitigates the need for traditional consensus-building processes. The PoS mechanism then finalizes these transactions and secures the network by allowing validators with a stake (investment) in the system to propose and vote on the validity of new blocks. \"The goal of Solana is to carry transactions as fast as news travels around the world,\" according toAnatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs. With its architectural design, Solana has the capability to handlethousands of transactions per second, positioning it among the faster blockchain networks. This focus on transaction speed is in line with Yakovenko's stated vision for the blockchain. In addition, Solana's fee model, which emphasizes lower transaction costs, may be seen as an appealing feature for both businesses and individual users.

    "news_title": "XRP Ripple Price | XRP Price and Live Chart - CoinDesk",
    "news_content": "The price of XRP (XRP) is $0.52011241 today, as of Oct 31 06:35 a.m., with a 24-hour trading volume of $913.48M. Over the last 24 hours, the price has decreased by -1.09%. XRP currently has a circulating supply of 56.81B and a market cap of $29.55B. XRP is the native cryptocurrency of XRP Ledger, which is an open-source, public blockchain designed to facilitate faster and cheaper payments. Sending payments overseas using the legacy financial system typically takes one to four business days and can be expensive. If a person uses XRP as a bridging currency, itâs possible to settle cross-border transactions in less than five seconds on the open-source XRP Ledger blockchain at a fraction of the cost of the more traditional methods. XRP price The original founders pre-mined (created at the time of the ledgerâs launch) 100 billion XRP tokens in 2012. This is all the XRP in existence, and no more XRP can be created. The founders provided Ripple with 80 billion tokens to fund future operations and development, while the founders divided the remaining XRP among themselves. Unlike bitcoin and other mined cryptocurrencies, where new coins enter the market in the form of block rewards, XRP enters circulation whenever Ripple decides to sell coins from its pre-mined stash on the secondary market. In 2017, the company transferred 55 billion of its 80 billion XRP tokens into anescrow accountfrom which it could sell a maximum of 1 billion tokens per month on the secondary market. Ripple did that to improve the transparency and predictability of XRP sales. XRP held in escrow are âundistributedâ whereas the rest (including XRP held by Ripple in wallets) is distributed (i.e. circulating supply). At the end of each month, unsold tokens are returned to escrow and re-distributed at a later period. Over the last 32 months, 32 billion XRPs have been released from escrow, and 26.7 billion have been returned. As of January 2022, theescrow accountholds 46.5 billion XRP tokens. Ripple publishes the data on itswebsite. In the three and a half years following the launch of XRP in 2012, its price experienced two significant jumps, including in December 2013 when XRPâs price surged almost 11-fold in 15 days and then one year later, when the price soared 454% in 33 days. After that, XRPâs price remained under $0.01 until the crypto market began to build momentum in early 2017. Between March 22, 2017, and Jan. 8, 2018, XRPâs price went parabolic in line with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at the time, rising by more than 51,000% from under one cent to a height of $3.40. XRP failed to maintain its momentum above the $3 level, and in a few months, the price fell to $0.10. XRP price remained beneath that level until April 2021, when the broader crypto market began to rise again. That month, XRP price reached a year-to-date high of $1.98. The surge, however, was short-lived, and the price tumbled to less than $1. How XRP works XRP transactions Key events and management ABOUT CONTACT POLICIES",

    "news_title": "Dogecoin Price | DOGE Price Index and Live Chart - CoinDesk",
    "news_content": "The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) is $0.17093488 today, as of Oct 31 06:35 a.m., with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.37B. Over the last 24 hours, the price has decreased by -3.49%. Dogecoin currently has a circulating supply of 146.58B and a market cap of $25.06B. Doge is the native cryptocurrency of dogecoin, a parody cryptocurrency based on a viral internet meme of a Shiba Inu dog. At first, the crypto project was created purely as a mockery of other cryptocurrency projects that were being launched at the time. The cryptocurrency is essentially a direct copy of Litecoinâs code and can be used to transfer value over the internet like all other digital assets. Doge was never designed to have any real-world utility beyond being a simple blockchain-based payment system; however, it quickly amassed a diehard community of fans who found and developed new use cases for it. Those included a third-party online tipping service, which led to doge becoming a leading tipping coin on social media platform Reddit and crowdfunding charitable causes using dogecoin. Doge price Unlike the case with many other cryptocurrencies, the founders of dogecoin didnât launch a public sale or âpremineâ coins prior to the tokenâs launch. Instead, a total supply limit of 100 billion coins was set and anyone with a laptop or smartphone could begin mining doge immediately. What was also unique about dogecoin was its block reward schedule. Copying another projectâs schedule called LuckyCoin, doge block rewards were completely random, meaning miners could receive anything from 0 to 1 million doge for mining a single block. The range of coins available for block rewards was tapered every 100,000 blocks until 2014 when the projectâs founders decided to change the block reward system to a fixed schedule. After that point, successful miners received 10,000 doge per block for their efforts. Despite dogecoinâs immediate popularity among early crypto users, it experienced only two short-lived big price jumps during its first almost four years in the market. The first took place almost immediately after the token went live, when its price soared 1,061% in 15 days from $0.0002 to $0.0023. The second big hike took place in March 2017 during the early stages of a crypto bull market. Dogeâs price rose by 1,494% to a peak of $0.004 â the highest price it had been since launching. While many other digital assets continued to rise through the second quarter of 2017, doge prices fell below $0.001. It wasnât until November 2017, when dogeâs price found support again from bullish investors. By January 2018, dogeâs price reached a peak of $0.018. It took over three years for doge to reach that level again, after it experienced a prolonged period of low trading activity as hype for the token waned. Renewed interest spurred by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other celebrity supporters at the start of 2021 sent dogeâs price surging past its previous all-time high. The coin posted a 9,884% gain between January and May. By the end of the rally, doge had peaked at a new all-time high of $0.74.

    "news_title": "Cardano Price | ADA Price Index and Live Chart- CoinDesk",
    "news_content": "The price of Cardano (ADA) is $0.35630912 today, as of Oct 31 06:35 a.m., with a 24-hour trading volume of $328.86M. Over the last 24 hours, the price has decreased by -0.49%. Cardano currently has a circulating supply of 35.74B and a market cap of $12.73B. Launched in 2017, Cardano is billed as a third-generation blockchain, following Bitcoin and Ethereum, which were the first- and second-generation blockchains. Cardano aims to compete directly with Ethereum and other decentralized application platforms, saying that it is a more scalable, secure and efficient alternative. Decentralized applications, or dapps, are similar to applications on a smartphone. The main difference is dapps run autonomously without a third party operating in the background. They achieve that autonomy by using smart contracts, which are computer programs designed specifically to perform a function when certain predetermined conditions are met. For example, you could create a collateralized borrowing dapp that loaned money to anyone if they deposited a certain amount of collateral in a wallet beforehand. The smart contract, in this instance, would be programmed to send a transaction (the loan) to the borrower immediately after the collateral wallet received the right amount of funds. The smart contract could also be programmed to liquidate the collateral (keep the locked-up funds) if the borrower failed to make repayments on time. Cardano also touts itself as being the only extensively peer-reviewed blockchain platform in the industry, and it routinely publishes academicresearch paperson its website. ADA price Cardanoâs native cryptocurrency, ADA, was launched in 2017 following a public sale of 25.9 billion ADA tokens, which began in September 2015. A further 5.2 billion tokens were issued and shared among the three separate entities that market and develop the Cardano protocol. They are Input Output Global (IOG), Emurgo and the Cardano Foundation. IOG was issued 2.46 billion tokens, Emurgo 2.06 billion and the foundation 648 million. When the token became publicly tradable, ADAâs price was $0.02. Within 96 days, prices skyrocketed to their previous all-time high of $1.31 in tune with the rest of the crypto market during the 2017 crypto bull run. Like the prices of most crypto assets in 2018, ADAâs price fell sharply that year. By November 2018, it had fallen back to $0.02. It took more than two years before ADA returned to above $1.31. Spurred by a new bull market cycle in early 2021, ADA continued to climb, and it hit $2.46 in mid-May 2021. A brief correction occurred between May and July before prices shot up even further. This time, ADA reached a new all-time high of $3.10 in early September 2021. How does Cardano work? Cardano development Key events and management ABOUT CONTACT POLICIES",

    "news_title": "Blockchain Technology Explained: What Is a Blockchain and How Does it Work?",
    "news_content": "Election 2024 coverage presented by Blockchain is a type of ledger technology that stores and records data. Blockchain is the buzzword that seems to dominate any conversation about the future of technology, from the power ofcryptocurrenciesto new forms of cybersecurity. While the applications for blockchain technology seem endless, not many people are entirely sure what it is. In the old days, transactions were tracked in written ledgers and stored in financial institutions. Traditional ledgers could be audited, but only by those with privileged access. Blockchain took these concepts and democratized them by removing the secrecy around how information â namely transaction data â was handled. In its simplest form, a blockchain is a distributed list of transactions that is constantly updated and reviewed. Also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), it can be programmed to record and track anything of value across a network spread around multiple locations and entities. This creates a sort of worldwide spider web of connected computers. While often associated with cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is not exclusive to the digital asset market. Thanks to its unique ability to add and store data, it can serve many other functions across a range of industries. See Also:What Are the Four Kinds of Blockchains? A blockchain can be broken down into two components: theblockand thechain. Ablockis a collection of data that is linked to other blocks chronologically in a virtual chain. You can think of a blockchain as a train consisting of multiple carriages connected in a line, where each carriage contains an amount of data. Just like with passengers in a real-life train carriage, blocks can fit only a certain amount of data before theyâre full. Each block also contains a timestamp, and so itâs clear when the data was recorded and stored â something thatâs vital for things like transaction or supply chain data where knowing exactly when a payment or package was processed is important. Read More:How Blocks Are Added to a Blockchain, Explained Simply There is not a single master copy of a blockchain. Instead, every person who runs a computer that contributes to the network â also known as a ânodeâ â maintains their own copy of the blockchain, and constantly checks with other nodes to make sure everyone has the same record of data. By having each individual contributor store their own copy, it means there is no single point of failure. This impressive layer of security also means itâs virtually impossible for malicious agents to tamper with the data stored on blockchains. If a hacker group wanted to manipulate any transaction on a blockchain, they would have to break into the device of every single network contributor around the world and change all records to show the same thing. Unlike a database of financial records stored by traditional institutions, the blockchain is completely transparent and aims to be distributed, shared across networks, and in many cases, fully public. By prioritizing transparency around transactions and how the information is stored, the blockchain can act as a single source of truth. Beyond being transparent with data, the blockchain is also a secure way to store it. Using Bitcoin as an example, hereâs how a transaction is added to a new block: When a bitcoin user sends a transaction, a message is created with both the senderâs and the receiverâs public addresses and the amount being transacted. The sender takes this data, adds their private key to the mix and then creates a hash of it (turns it into a fixed-length code.) This creates a digital signature to confirm the person who owns the amount of bitcoin intends to send it to the receiver. See Also:Private Keys vs. Public Keys The sender then packages this digital signature with the message and their own public key and broadcasts it to the network. Itâs kind of like saying, âHey, everyone! I want to send this person bitcoin.â (Note: For most wallets and other applications, all this happens âunder the hoodâ and users donât have to actually deal with the processes themselves.) The packaged transaction joins a waiting room filled with other unconfirmed transactions looking to be added to the blockchain, known as a âmempool.â In the case of the Bitcoin network, miners who have successfully discovered new blocks throughproof-of-workthen take a batch of transactions from the mempool (usually based on which ones have the highest fees attached), verify each transaction to make sure each sender actually has the amount of bitcoin in their wallets they want to send, run it through software to make sure the packaged data (digital signatures, messages and public keys) are legitimate, add it to the new block and finally broadcast the proposed new block to the network so that other miners can double-check everything is correct. This is similar to the process used inproof-of-stakeblockchains, except instead of mining nodes discovering and verifying transactions, users who have locked away an amount of cryptocurrency â known as âstakersâ or âvalidatorsâ â carry out the process. Nodes can perform a variety of tasks. These include keeping a historical record of all transaction data, verifying transactions, and, in the case of mining nodes or validator nodes, adding new blocks to the blockchain. Once a transaction has been approved and added, the information cannot be altered or rewritten. That is why data stored on a blockchain network is described as âimmutable.â The blockchain simply records every transaction that has ever taken place on its network. For example, the Ethereum blockchain is a record of all ether transactions that have ever taken place. So if there are updates that need to be made around a previous transaction, rather than going back to the initial data, a new record is made about the change. The blockchain removes the need for intermediaries like banks. The peer-to-peer network cuts out the middleman and allows transactions to be secure, cutting down on costs, and can be reviewed by anyone. Beyond being used for finances, blockchain technology has many other functions. Hospitals are integrating the blockchain to help track medical record data and improve their accuracy. Agricultural firms use it logistically to track the supply chain of food. Smart contracts rely on it to keep a record of all agreements and state changes. More recently, it has become a means to trade, sell and authenticate original digital pieces of art. Blockchains are becoming an increasingly important part of how we live, work and interact with our digital information. Like with every other new, revolutionary technology, there is no one set of standards, and the overall impact is still being discovered. But thereâs no doubt it is here to stay.

    "news_title": "What Is Web3?",
    "news_content": "Election 2024 coverage presented by Web3 â also known as âWeb3â³ or âWeb 3.0â³ â is a term you may of heard thrown around a lot lately. It simply refers to the next iteration of the internet that promotes decentralized protocols and aims to reduce dependency on large tech companies like Youtube, Netflix and Amazon. But what is it, and why is it on everyoneâs minds? To understand Web3, it makes sense to understand what came before. The first version of the Internet â known as Web1 â arrived in the late 1990s and comprised a collection of links and homepages. Websites werenât particularly interactive. You couldnât do much apart from read things and publish basic content for others to read. Brian Brooks, the CEO of Bitfury, put it smartly in aspeech to the U.S. Congressin December 2021: âIf people remember their original AOL account, it was an ability to look in a curated âwalled gardenâ at a set of content that was not interactive, but was presented to you on AOL, the way that Time Magazine used to show you the articles they wanted you to see inside of their magazine, just you could see it on a screen.â Web2 came next. Some people call this the âread/writeâ version of the internet, in reference to a computer code that lets you both open and edit files rather than just view them. This version of the Internet allowed people to not only consume content, but create their own and publish it on blogs like Tumblr, Internet forums and marketplaces like Craigslist. Later, the emergence of social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram took content sharing to new heights. After a while, the general public became cognizant about the way their personal data was beingharvested by tech giantsand used to create tailored advertisements and marketing campaigns. Facebook, in particular, has had the spotlight shone on it innumerable times for breaching data privacy laws and was hit with a $5 billion fine in 2019 â thelargest penalty ever issuedby the Federal Trade Commission (FTC.) Although Web2 has brought the world amazing free services, a lot of people have grown tired of the new âwalled gardensâ these huge tech companies have created and want to have more control over their data and content. This is where Web3 comes in. Web3 can be understood as the âread/write/ownâ phase of the Internet. Rather than just using free tech platforms in exchange for our data, users can participate in the governance and operation of the protocols themselves. This means people can become participants and shareholders, not just customers or products. In Web3, these shares are called tokens or cryptocurrencies, and they represent ownership of decentralized networks known as blockchains. If you hold enough of these tokens, you have a say over the network. Holders of governance tokens can spend their assets to vote on the future of, say, adecentralizedlending protocol. Again, hereâs Brooks: âThe real message here is that what happens on the decentralized internet is decided by the investors versus what happens on the main internet is decided by Twitter, Facebook, Google and a small number of other companies.â Web3 makes the proliferation of cooperative governance structures for once-centralized products possible. Anything at all can be tokenized, whether itâs ameme,a piece of art, apersonâs social media outputor tickets toGary Veeâs conferences. A great example of the paradigm shift is in the gaming industry. Gamers grumble endlessly about the bugs that developers leave in their favorite video game, or how the latest patch has upset the balance of their favorite weapon. With Web3, gamers can invest in the game itself and vote on how things should be run. Large Web2 companies, like Meta and Ubisoft, are creating virtual worlds powered in part by Web3. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will also play a huge role in reshaping the gaming industry by allowing players to become the immutable owners of the items they accrue. Cryptocurrenciesare a key component of the Web3 ecosystem. One of the core ideas of Web3 as laid out by theEthereum Foundationis that âWeb3 has native payments: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors.â Within Web3, the idea of ownership of assets is key, and cryptocurrencies not only serve as a medium of exchange, but also allow for a âtoken economy,â where users can earn cryptocurrencies for contributing to a platform, arguably fostering a more equitable internet. Cryptocurrencies provide the financial infrastructure and incentive mechanisms that underpin Web3. Finally, cryptocurrencies provide a direct, trustless method of payments and exchange and remove the third party control that Web3 strives to eliminate. Read More:What Are Web3 Cryptos? Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)are another key component of Web3. NFTs are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain. Unlike crypto, every NFT has a distinct value and contains specific information that makes it unique. NFTs enable the ownership and exchange of digital goods, such as digital art, music and evenvirtual real estate. NFTs provide a way to prove ownership and authenticity of digital content, which was not possible in the Web2 model. By allowing creators to tokenize their work, NFTs are democratizing the digital economy, arguably giving economic power back to creators and users, which aligns with the principles of Web3. Finally, NFTs can also allow players of games to own their in-game items such as outfits, weapons and other cosmetics, which they can then trade directly with other players without third-party intervention. Read More:What Are NFTs and How Do They Work? Themetaverserefers to a collective virtual shared space, which may or may not have Web3 elements. People often refer to games like Roblox or Minecraft as Web2 metaverses. What separates the Web3 version of these virtual worlds is the inclusion of NFTs and blockchain as an essential part of the world. The inherent decentralization of Web3 enables a metaverse where users have true ownership over virtual assets, identities and data. These virtual assets, often taking the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), can be bought, sold or traded on a blockchain directly. Read More:A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse The main criticism of Web3 technology is that it falls short of its ideals. Ownership over blockchain networks is not equally distributed but concentrated in the hands of early adopters and venture capitalists. Apublic spatrecently erupted on Twitter between Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorseyâ and various venture capitalists over Web3, bringing this debate to the forefront. At the heart of the critiques is the idea of âdecentralization theater,â where blockchain projects are decentralized in name but not in substance. Private blockchains, VC-backed investments, ordecentralized finance(DeFi) protocols where just a few people hold the keys to hundreds of millions of dollars are all examples of decentralization theater. And despite the supposedly leaderless community of protocols, there are clear figureheads. Izabella Kaminska, the outgoing editor of the FT blog Alphaville,pointedto the huge amount of power that Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder ofEthereum, continues to have over the network, even though heâs no longer involved in its development: âVitalik is a funny and contradictory phenomenon in his own right. He operates as the spiritual leader of a de facto headless system, while holding incredible sway and influence over the headless system he created and oversees,â Kaminska told The Crypto Syllabus. Things arenât much better within decentralized finance protocols. Theyâre rife with voter absenteeism, often rely on centralized infrastructure and the barrier to entry in creating them is still high, given that creating blockchains seems to be arcane magic reserved for only the most highly specialized engineers. But despite its problems, Web3 has a lot of potential. Whether itâs too idealistic to put into practice will be something that everyday users will discover over the next decade.

    "news_title": "What Is a Dapp? Decentralized Apps Explained",
    "news_content": "Election 2024 coverage presented by Adecentralized applicationâ or dapp â is like a digital app found on any smartphone or laptop, with the additional feature of employingblockchain technologyto keep usersâ data out of the hands of the organizations behind it. Just likecryptocurrencyis decentralized money, dapps are decentralized apps. The blockchain stores copies of its expanding stack of data on a large number of participating computers, known as ânodes,â all at once. These computers are owned by users, not by the creators of the dapp. A full explanation of how blockchain technology works can be foundhere. Dapps are as varied as conventional apps: They can provide social networks, games, entertainment, productivity tools and so on. Many are designed as tools to help consumers access decentralized financial services, orDeFi. This latter function is so widespread that theEthereumnetwork white paper categorized dapps into \"financial,\" \"semi-financial\" and \"other.\" Ethereum has been the dominant host for dapps so far. At its foundation, one of the primary goals of the network was to make dapps easier to create. Dapp users may feel more secure in the knowledge that the creators of the application cannot control how it is used - at least, not in the conventional way. For example, the creators of a social network dapp are powerless to remove a post or exclude a user. They are also unable to sell usersâ data to other entities because dapps run autonomously once theyâre launched. How is this possible? Itâs all down to the use ofsmart contractsâ computer programs deployed and on a blockchain designed to execute the rules of a contract without human involvement. For example, a smart contract could be coded to issue a loan once a user deposits a sufficient amount of collateral into it. Dapps are also commonly open source, meaning that anyone can view and use the underlying code. Decentralized autonomous organizations, orDAOs, can be seen as a kind of dapp. They aim to use an intricate arrangement of smart contracts to achieve the functions of a traditional organization without the need for corporate executives and hierarchies. They determine policy entirely through a weighted voting system where members who lock away more tokens possess greater voting power. The idea behind this concept is that those who have committed more funds to a DAO will be more likely to participate in it honestly, for the good of the organization.

    "news_title": "Centralized Exchange (CEX) vs. Decentralized Exchange (DEX): Whatâs the Difference?",
    "news_content": "Election 2024 coverage presented by If you are considering buying or selling crypto, your first port of call will probably be an exchange. Most commonly, the first point of entry to trading cryptocurrency is acentralized exchange(CEX), a digital marketplace where crypto trading takes place. You have probably heard of a few:  Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and so on. In Nov. 2022, a CoinDesk scoop led to a stunning turn of events that led to formerly popular exchangeFTX collapsing and filing for bankruptcy. This has led a lot of crypto investors to look for alternatives to centralized exchanges. The obvious alternative are a newer type of exchange that is decentralized such asUniswapandPancakeswap. These decentralized exchanges radically rethink how exchanges can work. See Also:What Is an Exchange Token? Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)have been emerging over the last five years to challenge incumbentCEXs. In brief, DEXs aim to offer lower transaction fees, let users directly hold their own assets and avoid some regulatory burdens. On the other hand, they face the cost of compensating their liquidity providers for a special kind of risk calledâimpermanent loss.â CEXs offer advantages too. Most centralized exchanges use a business model similar to traditional institutions like the New York Stock Exchange, which is a structure traditional investors understand and may feel more comfortable with. Their interfaces and apps tend to be more beginner and user-friendly and generally offer more liquidity and stronger regulatory assurances, which can be especially important for institutional clients. But it also means the central company running the exchange has a lot of power and responsibility for the financial stability and health of the exchange. See Also:How to Get Your Wealth Off an Exchange If the recent drama around FTX has you considering moving to a DEX, here's what you need to know. DEXs aim to complete transactions more quickly and cheaply than their centralized counterparts. They do this by cutting out the intermediary entities that take a cut of transaction fees on CEXs. The 2018whitepaperof the worldâs largest DEX, Uniswap, proclaims \"zero rent extraction.\" It aims to protect its users from the additional costs entailed in generating profit for the intermediaries that run CEXs.Bancor, which launched in 2017 and describes itself as the first DEX, advocates for the decentralized approach like this: âLiquidity on traditional asset exchanges has historically been provided by a small handful of professional trading firms with permissioned access and specialized tools. This concentrates liquidity in the hands of a few actors who can withdraw their assets during periods of volatility and restrict trading of an asset when users need it the most.â In late 2021, the leading DEX Uniswap was charging a 0.05% transaction fee on the $100,000 tradesampled by global accountancy KPMG. CEXs Binance, Coinbase and Kraken were charging 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.2%, respectively. DEXs useâautomated market makerâprotocols to determine the prices of assets without a centralized body orchestrating trades. A common approach is the âconstant productâ mechanism, which determines prices offered as a function of the ratio of the DEXâs total reserves of each of the assets involved. This has the advantage of tending to keep reserves in relative balance: If any asset became scarce, it would become extremely expensive. Nevertheless, DEXs still tend to offer roughly the same prices for assets as CEXs. This is because attentive traders or bots can quickly profit from any discrepancy in prices througharbitrage. If a certain pool contained very little ETH, it would have to let traders sell ETH into the pool at a higher price than the wider market indicated. Traders could easily profit by buying it in the wider market and selling it into the pool. As they did so, the volume in the pool would rise, reducing its offered price until it matched the wider market. Read More:Understanding the Technology Behind Decentralized Exchanges As neat as this system is, it does introduce a risk for the liquidity providers behind the pool. The risk is called impermanent loss. Liquidity providers are entitled to withdraw the portion of the value of the pool they contributed, not the exact number of tokens they put in. It could not promise all providers their exact tokens, because the ratio of different tokens held in the pool changes as trades occur. But as the ratio adjusts to reflect current wider market prices, the pool is going to progressively contain more of whatever token is losing value, and vice versa. This means that a liquidity provider will tend to end up withdrawing more of the token that lost value and less of the one that gained value, compared with their starting assets. Therefore, they will end up poorer than if they had just held onto their assets privately. In practice, DEXs generally compensate liquidity providers through transaction fees. But that means charging higher fees than they would otherwise need. Another part of the trade-off between DEXs and CEXs comes down to whether users would rather hold their own crypto directly or entrust it to the exchange. CEXs typically require that users place assets in their custody before trading. Holding your assets yourself keeps to the ideal of self-reliance that permeates the crypto sector. You have full and exclusive control over them. But on the other hand, without due care,private keyscan get lost or destroyed, rendering the associated assets irretrievable. Welshman James Howells mistakenly threw away a hard drive in 2013 and lost access to 7,500 bitcoins that would be worth well over $100 million as of Nov. 2022. He has repeatedly and unsuccessfullyappealed to the local councilto let him excavate its landfill site. The growing popularity of DEXs may in part reflect their success in dodging some regulatory hurdles. The company that builds a DEX avoids acting as a financial intermediary or counterparty and does not have to meetknow-your-customer (KYC)or anti-money laundering (AML) standards because it operates autonomously. ShapeShift used to be a CEX until its CEO said the company lost 95% of its users as a result of KYC measures it was forced to implement in 2018. In 2021, Shapeshift decidedly pivoted andbecame a DEXto shrug off this problem. DEXs may struggle more than CEXs when working with larger investors. At this time, they cannot yet compete with the largest CEXs in size so they cannot offer as much liquidity. When they meet with insufficient liquidity, large orders can face unplanned additional costs called âslippage.â Furthermore, institutional investors face AML and other regulatory hurdles of their own and may struggle to deal with exchanges that do not submit to similar requirements. Sergej Kunz, the co-founder of liquidity aggregator DEX 1inch Network,noted last yearthat banks and hedge funds had been slow to engage with decentralized finance (DeFi) because of their own regulatory hurdles. Although it is a DEX, his company now plans to launch a compliant product called 1inch Pro, specifically to cater to these clients. New aggregator protocols like 1inch have emerged specifically to help larger investors avoid liquidity problems when using DEXs. 1inch raised $12 million in 2020 in a funding round led by Pantera Capital. The rise of aggregators actually means that users can access liquidity from DEXs and CEXs at the same time. The protocol DiversiFi, which is itself a DEX, aggregates liquidity from both kinds of exchanges in order to help its users conclude larger trades more efficiently. This helps investors to avoid the costs that come with an exchangeâs liquidity proving too small for their order. When it comes to deciding which type of exchange to use, it boils down to two things: If you are you primarily interested in ease of use and are uncomfortable with being in total control of your own wallet then a CEX is probably the best option for you. If lower fees and more control over your own funds are most important to you, then a DEX is the way to go. Whichever way you go, make sure you know how toget your crypto off an exchangeand intocold storageto keep your wealth safe in the long term.

    "news_title": "What Is Cryptocurrency?",
    "news_content": "Election 2024 coverage presented by Cryptocurrency is a relatively new type of money that operates in a completely different way than the traditional currency we all use every day. The most basic difference is that itâs exclusively a virtual currency, meaning there are no physical cryptocurrency coins or notes you can keep in your back pocket. Itâs also issued, or created, in a unique way. Instead of being produced by a central bank or government, like U.S. dollars, euros and other fiat currencies are, new cryptocurrency units typically enter circulation through a technological process that involves the participation of volunteers from all over the world using their computers. That is why cryptocurrency is often described as âdecentralized.â Cryptocurrencies are typically not controlled or operated by any single entity in any single country. It takes an entire network of volunteers from around the world to secure and validate transactions made with cryptocurrency. But it isnât just theyâre digital nature and how theyâre issued that sets cryptocurrencies apart from regular currencies; there are other differences: The word âcryptoâ in cryptocurrency refers to the special system of encrypting and decrypting information â known ascryptographyâ which is used to secure all transactions sent between users. Cryptography plays a vitally important role in allowing users to freely transact tokens and coins between one another without the need for an intermediary like a bank to keep track of each personâs balance and ensure the network remains secure. It also solves a problem that used to make middlemen like banks indispensable â the double-spend issue: when a person attempts to spend the same balance twice with two different parties. Cryptocurrencies use cryptography to encrypt sensitive information, including the private keys â long alphanumeric strings of characters â of crypto holders. Think of private keys as the passwords that determine the ownership of cryptocurrencies. Keep in mind that cryptocurrencies cannot be stored outside of the blockchain. They are permanently based on the blockchain. Hence, when someone says they own X amount of coins, what they really mean is that their password can legitimately claim X amount of coins on the blockchain. These private keys are what crypto holders store on their wallets, which, as you must have guessed, are special kinds of software or devices designed specifically for this purpose. In instances where a crypto holderloses access to his or her private key, the cryptocurrencies associated with such keys could be lost permanently. With the help of a cryptographic technique, private keys are encrypted to create wallet addresses, which can be likened to bank account numbers. In essence, you need your private key to digitally sign transactions. This is essentially like broadcasting to everyone in the network, âI confirm I am sending this amount of X coin to this person.â In contrast, wallet addresses indicate the destination of transactions. The encryptions are executed in only one direction, which makes it impossible to derive private keys from a personâs wallet addresses. While the cryptocurrencies themselves act as a medium for exchanging or for storing value, they all rely on a special type of public ledger technology called âblockchainâ to record data and to keep track of all of the transactions being sent across the network. A blockchain is exactly what it sounds like â a virtual chain of blocks each containing a batch of transactions and other data. Once each block is added to the chain, it becomes immutable, meaning the data stored inside it cannot be changed or removed. Because cryptocurrencies are managed by a network of volunteer contributors known as ânodesâ and not by a single intermediary, a system must be in place that ensures everyone participates honestly when recording and adding new data to the blockchain ledger. The nodes perform a variety of roles on the network, from storing a full archive of all historical transactions to validating new transaction data. By having a distributed group of people all maintaining their own copy of the ledger, blockchain technology has the following advantages over traditional finance where a master copy is maintained by a single institution: The nodes collectively manage the database and confirm new entries are valid transactions. Think of it as having a cluster of computers take up the roles of a bank by consistently updating the balance sheets of users. In the case of distributed ledgers, however, the balance sheets arenât stored in a single server. Instead, there are multiple copies of the balance sheets distributed across several computers, with each node, or computer connected to the network, functioning as a separate server. Therefore, even if one of the computers go offline, it wouldnât be as detrimental as having a single server-based database go offline as can be the case in traditional banking systems. This infrastructural design makes it possible for cryptocurrencies to evade the security mishaps that often plague fiat. It is difficult to attack or manipulate this system because the attackers must gain control of over 50% of computers connected to the blockchain network. Depending on how big the network is, it can be prohibitively expensive to carry out a coordinated attack. If you compare the amount required to attack established cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and what the attacker stands to gain at the end of the day, pursuing such an endeavor wouldnât be viable financially. Also, it is worth mentioning that the distributed nature of these digital assets establishes their censorship-resistant attributes. Unlike the case with banks, which governments regulate, cryptocurrencies have their databases spread across the globe. Therefore, when a government shuts down one of these computers or all the computers within its jurisdiction, the network will continue to function because there are potentially thousands of other nodes in other countries beyond the reach of one government. So far in this guide, we have explained why cryptocurrencies are secure and why they are censorship-resistant. Now, let us take a look at how crypto transactions are vetted. Recall that blockchains are distributed databases where all the transactions executed on a crypto network are recorded permanently. Every block of transactions is linked together chronologically in the order the transactions were validated. Because it is impossible to set up a central authority or bank to manage blockchains, crypto transactions are validated by nodes (computers connected to a blockchain). So the question is: How do these networks ensure that node operators are willing to partake in the validation process? The only way to guarantee there will always be individuals willing to invest their time and computers in a blockchainâs validation system is to introduce incentives to do so. With incentives, validators are encouraged to participate actively and honestly in the validation process to earn rewards in the form of newly minted (created) cryptocurrencies. This incentive system sets the rules that govern the process of picking validators who would, in turn, verify the next batch of transactions. It also ensures that the activities of the validators align with the goal of the network as a whole. Validator nodes found to be involved in actions that undermine the validity of the crypto network can be barred from taking part in subsequent validation processes or punished accordingly. These incentive infrastructures are also known as consensus protocols. There is a wide range of consensus protocols being used by existing blockchain networks. The two most common ones are: Tokens are digital assets issued bydecentralized applicationsbased on blockchains. These are applications similar to the ones you might find on your smartphone, but instead of being operated by a single company, they run completely autonomously. Think of it like a free Uber app where taxi drivers and customers can connect together without having to pay the middleman company a cut of profits. Because these applications depend on the infrastructure of blockchains, transactions involving tokens come with an added fee settled in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain in question. The value of a cryptocurrency usually depends on the utility of its underlying blockchain â though there have been many instances where social media hype and other superficial factors have played a role in pumping up prices. The cryptocurrencies of blockchains perceived to have a wide range of utilities are usually more valuable than those that donât offer much. It all boils down, though, to the demand for the coin relative to its supply and whether the buyer is willing to pay more than the amount the seller initially acquired the coin for. Notably, cryptocurrencies tend to favor a deflationary system, whereby the number of new coins introduced to the market is predictable and graduallyreducesover time. For many cryptocurrencies, another important element is the total number of coins that can ever exist is often fixed. For instance, there will be only 21 million bitcoins created, of which more than 18 million are already in circulation. This deflationary-based system is the complete opposite of what we have in traditional finance, where governments have the license to print an infinite number of fiat notes and inadvertently devalue their currencies. Bitcoin was the first of the many cryptocurrencies that exist today. Following its introduction in 2009, developers began to create other variants of cryptocurrencies based on the technology powering the Bitcoin network. In most cases, the cryptocurrencies were designed to improve upon the standards set by Bitcoin. That is why other cryptocurrencies that came after bitcoin are collectively called âaltcoinsâ from the phrase âalternatives to bitcoin.â Prominent examples are: Initially, cryptocurrency was pushed as an alternative to fiat currency based on the premise that it is portable, censorship-resistant, available globally and an affordable means of executing cross-border transactions. But, other than the digital assets pinned to fiat currencies, the value of cryptocurrencies hasnât been able to replicate the level of stability needed to function effectively as a medium of exchange. As a result, most crypto holders have shifted their attention to the investment potential of cryptocurrencies, which has since birthed the speculative side of the crypto market. Investors seem to be more concerned about the possibility that the price of a cryptocurrency may rise sometime in the future than whether they can use cryptocurrencies to purchase goods and services, and so crypto is now predominantly viewed as an investment.

    "news_title": "As Hong Kong Firms Downsize, Animoca Built a Workspace the Size of 10 Tennis Courts",
    "news_content": "Election 2024 coverage presented by Hong Kong is feeling the ripple effects of aslow mainland Chinese economy, and its financial sector, as well as professional services firms, areslimming downtheir real estate footprint tocope with slowing demand. Then there's Animoca Brands, a Web3 company known for its NFTs and GameFi verticals. It recently opened a new 28,000 square-foot (2,601-meter) office spread across two floors in an up-and-coming tech district on the south side of Hong Kong island. That's about 10 times thesize of a tennis court. âWe went from 7,500 square feet to 28,000 square feet,â said Evan Auyang, president of Animoca Brands, during an interview with CoinDesk. âItâs a renterâs market right now in Hong Kong, and we saw this as the perfect time to create a collaborative space not just for us but for other companies in our portfolio.â While crypto is having something of a bull market, Animoca had a rocky 2023 â like the rest of the crypto sector â battling layoffs and cutting the target size of its metaverse fund from$2 billion to $800 million. \"As a company, we have to experiment. We have to accept failure as part of it,â he said, adding that Animoca, today, has pivoted a few times over the course of its short history. The company's evolution is driven by a culture of experimentation and by bringing on talent that naturally pushes the company in new directions. One thing that's new to Animoca, and different from other Web3 companies, is the amount of gray hair in the building. âOur executive team is fairly experienced. Weâre not kids in our 20s. Most of us are in our 40s and 50s,â Auyang said. âWeâve been through a lot.\" Auyang highlights the importance of government backing in Animoca's decision to stay in Hong Kong, describing it as \"invaluable\" pointing to a pivotal moment when the Financial Services and Treasury Bureauannounced its support for Web3alongside Animocaâs co-founder and executive chairman, Yat Siu. âWhen the [FSTB] announced Hong Kongâs ambitions for Web3, they did it on stage with Yat Siu. That level of partnership is unique,â he said. Hong Kongâs unique creative energy, fueled by its rich heritage in film, music, and art, is something Animoca believes canât be replicated elsewhere. While the company could theoretically operate from anywhere â and Auyang said that Hong Kong's prolonged Covid-19 lockdowns had Animoca on the brink of some tough decisions â it ultimately just couldn't leave the city. âDuring COVID, we thought about relocating. We could be anywhere.â Auyang said. âBut ultimately, we were born here. Hong Kong is part of our DNA.â UPDATE (Oct. 29, 03:50 UTC):Updates Yat Siu's title.

    "news_title": "Aggregation Is the Only Way to Unify Web3",
    "news_content": "Election 2024 coverage presented by In the early days of the Internet, networks were isolated and couldnât communicate with each other. Then TCP/IP came along, connecting everything and changing the game. Today, Web3 faces a similar problem to the early internetâblockchains and platforms are stuck in silos, fragmenting liquidity and making for a clunky user experience. Value canât flow freely between networks, limiting what users and markets can actually do. Butaggregationwould change all that by tearing down the walls and unlocking the full potential of Web3. Marc Boiron is the chief executive officer atPolygon Labs, developer of the eponymous blockchain and, more recently, AggLayer. Web3 needs an aggregation layer that can break down the silos between networks. This wouldnât just fix the issues we see todayâit would kick off a new chapter in the internet's evolution, unlocking new design spaces and possibilities for a truly unified crypto ecosystem. With such a layer, every platform could access more liquidity and users across all connected chains. Any exchange could offer any asset, no matter which network itâs on. No more network integrations necessary to list new tokens. Thatâs the kind of future we should be building toward. Aggregation is the key for Web3 to work like the Internet does todayâeverything is available from one place, with information, assets, and value moving around as easily as sending an email. Users could have a single universal profile and wallet that serves as their gateway to all of Web3, keeping a secure, unchangeable record of their history and credentials. Additionally, a cross-chain settlement layer would unify the developer experience, letting builders create smoother, more powerful apps that are not constrained by bottlenecks of a single chain or fragmentation of the user experience and assets. By simplifying complex cross-chain processes into easy commands, projects could tap into the entire ecosystem, accessing any asset or tool from any chain. While these ideas sound great in theory, it's the real-world applications that will unlock their full potential. Take decentralized finance, for example. Right now, liquidity in and users of DeFi dApps are stuck in \"walled gardens\" across different blockchains. Developers are forced to choose specific chains for deployment based on technical perks or grants, and users are left navigating these silos with limited options. The only current solutionsâbridges and wrapped tokensâare often inefficient, expensive, and risky. A cross-chain settlement layer would change all that, enhancing innovations such as unified yield farming, where users could seamlessly earn returns on their assets across multiple chains without having to rely on any third-party bridges or wrapped tokens. Combine that with cheap, easy token swaps and new opportunities in cross-chain arbitrage, and DeFi would become even more powerful than it is now. An aggregated approach would also benefit tokenized real-world assets. Right now, the biggest hurdle to RWA adoption is the lack of cross-chain settlement between blockchains. Tokenizing an RWA on Ethereum, for example, limits its interaction with networks that are incompatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, fragmenting the assetâs value. This creates isolated pockets rather than a real market, which is why the European Central Bank hascalledfor a shared digital ledger for tokenized assets. Solving this problem would enable true cross-chain markets, where fractional ownership and funds could be backed by a wider variety of assets than ever before. Everything from land and art to stocks and investment funds could exist in a global digital economy, untethered from a physical location. Aggregated networks hold massive potential for Web3 gaming. For years, the promise of digital ownership and open markets in gaming has been on the horizon, but fragmentation has kept it from being fully realized. While ecosystems such as Immutable and Ronin exist, they can't easily move players or content between them. Now, imagine all gaming platforms connecting to a single cross-chain settlement layer. Suddenly, every game would be part of the same ecosystem, like having a Steam account that gives you full access to games across PC, Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation. Developers would gain access to the entire global gamer base as potential users, breaking down the barriers between fragmented ecosystems. This same concept applies to the emerging field of decentralized physical infrastructure networks. DePINs provide decentralized internet services through a network of incentivized physical devices, offering better performance than traditional centralized providers while removing concerns about Big Tech's data harvesting or infrastructure downtime. Right now, DePINs operate in silos, making data sharing and system integration unnecessarily complicated and costly. An aggregation network solves these silos, allowing easy collaboration between different DePIN systems, cutting costs, and removing hurdles to cross-chain settlement. *  *  * These examples are scratching the surface, hinting at a wide range of possibilities in areas such as user data ownership and monetization. Whatâs even more exciting is that this kind of cross-chain settlement will let developers build entirely new projects and services we havenât imagined. The topic of interoperability and aggregation has been rapidly gaining momentum lately, with many well-known blockchain tech leaders working on solutions to unify Web3. Next month, the first-ever event focused on blockchain aggregation, theAggregation Summit, will kick off in Bangkok ahead of theEthereum Foundation'sDevcon 2024conference. A fully connected, fast, affordable, and secure Web3 is within reachâand it's an internet with native value open to everyone. The key is aggregation.

    "news_content": "DeFi, short for decentralized finance, represents a shift in the financial sector by leveragingblockchain technology, primarily Ethereum, to eliminate traditional financial intermediaries. It enables various financial applications, from simple transactions to complex contracts, through smart contracts that execute automatically under specific conditions. Key DeFi applications includedecentralized exchanges (DEXs),stablecoins, lending platforms, and prediction markets. DeFi offers financial services like loans and interest-earning opportunities without traditional identity verification, relying instead on collateral, usually in cryptocurrency. This innovative sector promises increased accessibility and efficiency but comes with risks, such as market volatility and unregulated projects.

    "news_title": "U.K. Gambling Commission Charges Fantasy Sports Firm Sorare With Providing Unlicensed Gambling Facilities",
    "news_content": "Election 2024 coverage presented by Sorare, a fantasy sports company, was charged with providing unlicensed gambling facilities in the U.K. in the Gambling Commission's first action against a blockchain-based platform. The company, based in Saint-Mande, France, operates fantasy soccer, basketball and baseball games that allow participants to buy and sell collectible cards using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It has inkeddeals with the English Premier Leagueand Germany'sBundesliga, among other national sporting associations. NFTsare unique digital tokens used to represent assets. \"Sorare is charged with providing facilities for gamblingwithout holding an operating licence,\" the commission said on its website. The company will have to appear on Oct. 4 in Birmingham Magistratesâ Court. The charges follow an almost three-year inquiry by the regulator. In 2021 the commission said it was looking into whether Sorareneeded a gambling license. The case is the first time it has clamped down on the use of a blockchain-based platform and the outcome could set a precedent for how regulators handle Web3 firms in the future. It is also another sign suggesting U.K. regulators are taking more enforcement action against suspected illicit activity in the crypto space followinga swoop on unregulated crypto ATM's. \"We firmly deny any claims that Sorare is a gambling product under U.K. laws,\" a Sorare spokesperson said. \"The Commission has misunderstood our business and wrongly determined that gambling laws apply to Sorare.\" Read more:Fantasy-Sports Firm Sorare Looks to Increase Appeal by Diluting Crypto Association Edited bySheldon Reback.
