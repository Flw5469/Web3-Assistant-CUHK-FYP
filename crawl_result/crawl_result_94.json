    "news_title": "Ubisoft Finally Launches Its NFT Game, Hoping to Capitalize on the Crypto Grift",
    "news_content": "Ubisoft hasnât yet left its hopes for the inevitable NFT comeback at the door like many other major publishers have these last few years. The publisherâs long-awaited figurine battlerChampions Tactics Grimoria Chronicleswent live last week, and already the game is asking those with deep pockets to drop hundreds or even thousands on digital figurines to battle with players online. The NFTs you can buy with in-game currency or crypto are selling for between $55 and an incredible $63,863. Ubisoft first announced Grimoria Chronicles last year, and the game went through a closed beta over the summer of 2024. Though the game technically launched on Oct. 23, Ubisoft made no peep about the game on any of its main social media accounts (although the developer has been promoting it on its ownTwitter), and you wonât find it featured onits websitealongside major releases likeStar Wars: OutlawsandAssassins Creed Shadows. The game is a turn-based battler where players have the chance to mint NFTs of figurines, all with a standard slate of stats and classic roles like âTankâ or âDamage.â You set up to three figures against an opponent’s slate. Then, each of you performs the classic dance of kicking each otherâs shins until one of you falls down. Your figures gain experience and loot for every battle, and then you rinse and repeat. Itâs like a rudimentary, PVP version ofDarkest Dungeon, but with more nickel and diming. Users are granted a few starter figures, but the game incentivizes you to buy, buy, buy. Want new figures? Youâll need to buy them off other players or âForgeâ them, which also costs crypto. In every way, this is yet another web3 game in the vein of the now-maligned âplay to earnâ gameAxie Infinity.Itâs running on the Oasys blockchain. Worse still, you need to sign into a Ubisoft account to access the game at all. As evidenced bylive gameplay, there are critical hits and other RNGs for damage. Still, Ubisoft claims on its webpage the game isnât based on luck but skill. You need to âpick the best champions to counter your opponentâs lineupâ and âmaster the ever-changing meta.â However, the gameâs NFTmarketplaceis absolutely subsumed with cheap figures with low stats and few abilities. The difference between a $7 and a $150 champion can be between a few points in stats like âVitalityâ or a higher initiative. By that token, the fabled $64,000 âSwift Zealotâ figure doesnât seem anywhere near worth the money, even if all you cared about in this world was winning more matches in the gameâs dull-looking, back-and-forth battles. In a statement, Ubisoft Paris studio director Francois Bodson toldIGNthat it worked with Ubisoftâs Strategic Innovation lab to ensure the blockchain âwas done in service of delivering new and innovative gaming experiences for our players.â He related his game to a âphysical trading card gameâ and said the team plans to keep up work on the title after launch. Each figure is procedurally generated from a host of pre-made assets, which guarantees none are truly that unique or have any real personality. It feels like a cash grab meant to incentivize players to grind long hours in anonymity or buy in for hundreds or thousands of dollars in the vain hope of cashing out later. Itâs a sick, twisted vision of gaming that players have long since rejected. Ubisoft is the only studio that hasnât got the memo on that front. Last year, Segaâs co-COO Shuji Utsumi said the company wasno longer totally soldon the whole NFT thing. Meanwhile,Mojangand Valve have summarily rejected crypto. The few remaining crypto gamesÂthat are still in development include Ready Player Oneâs author Ernest Cline andÂhis âmetaverseâ title, which isÂ based on his geek-culture obsessed universe. Ubisoft has been on the NFT train for the past three years, but it hasnât met with much success on that front. The publisher was widely condemned for attempting to shove NFTs into Ghost Recon: Breakpoint in 2021. Ubisoftâs plan to sell numbered helmets, pants, and gunsreportedlynetted the company just a few hundred dollars through its Quartz platform. Ubisofthaltedits plans for more Quartz items inWildlandsandGhost Recon: Breakpointin 2022. Ubisoft is trying to have its cake and eat it, too. It hopes nobody notices the new crypto game, knowing how the gaming community has largely rejected digital currency. Itâs hoping that crypto might make a comeback or that enough people will buy-in on the backend. Crypto in gaming is nothing more than a more effective monetization scheme than microtransactions.ÂUbisoftâs head of subscriptions, Philippe Tremblay, said earlier this year players would eventuallyget âcomfortableâ not owning their games.If anything is clear, buying a âone of a kindâ digital figurine doesnât supply you with any more ownership than before.
