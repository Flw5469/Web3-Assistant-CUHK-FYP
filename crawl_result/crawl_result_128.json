    "news_title": "Cardano: Analyst Sees Opportunity Despite On-Chain Decline",
    "news_content": "The Cardano market (ADA) is now at a crossroads, going through tough times with the cryptocurrency market heating up. Despite the latest $73,000 mark that Bitcoin had attained today, the Cardano trade is losing its way forward, at the current timetrading at $0.356. That amounts to 12% of lost value compared to what the coin hit just last month. Today, ADA won a minimal 2.2%, but investors see it failing in comparison with newer coins, which now are rapidly growing in prices. For ADA holders, crypto expert Ali Martinez has some encouraging news. He thinks Cardano might behave in line with its spectacular 2020 expansion. Following a protracted consolidation period, ADA surged by almost 4,000% and peaked at $3.10 within 10 months. I believe#Cardano$ADAis following a similar pattern to 2020. If history repeats, we might see a pump around November 18—about two weeks after the US elections—and a potential market top by September 2025.pic.twitter.com/GgKWBqzYXU — Ali (@ali_charts)October 29, 2024 Martinez thinks if history repeats itself, we may see a price jump starting around November 18, 2024–two weeks after the US elections.  As of now, Martinez said ADA has spent 455 days in a range since the last peak, and may hit $6.50 in September 2025 as it is going to skyrocket by 2,288%.  ADA market cap currently at $12.4 billion. Chart:TradingView.com A fresh analysis from IntoTheBlock that showed Cardano’s Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio has surged to its highest level since June adds to the concern. Often preceding price pullbacks, this statistic points to a decrease in on-chain activity relative to price increases. The report underlined that ADA might struggle to keep increasing pace without more on-chain involvement. Cardano’s NVT ratio has surged to its highest level since June, indicating a decrease in on-chain activity relative to price growth. This classic overvaluation signal is notable given$ADA‘s recent underperformance, suggesting the potential for further downside. Historically,…pic.twitter.com/yTx83exBXM — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock)October 29, 2024  Despite these challenges, some analysts are optimistic about Cardano’s long-term horizon. They foresee an estimated 130% growth in the next three months and an impressive 140% increase in the next year. This gap between short-term struggles and long-term optimism would suggest that Cardano has short-term pain ahead but that significant recovery is on the horizon. This is a challenging time for Cardano as investors monitor closely its price movement and the behavior of trading with the token. As long as concerns over further dips linger, there are some individuals that believe this is a good opportunity to enter the ADA market before it takes off. Analysts like Ali Martinez offer hope based on previous tendencies despite Cardano’s recent performance. ADA needs the next several weeks to solidify its position in the fast-changing crypto industry. Investors will monitor to see if Cardano can restore market momentum. Featured image from CoinFlip.tech, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.
