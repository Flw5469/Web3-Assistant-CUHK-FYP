Despite this uptick, the price has dropped by 11.34% in the last month and 26.50% over six months. The nearest resistance level is at $0.39. If ADA breaks above this, it could reach $0.42, representing a potential gain of about 12%. Support levels are at $0.33 and $0.30. The Relative Strength Index is neutral at 47.97. The price is above the 10-day Simple Moving Average of $0.34 and close to the 100-day SMA of $0.35. These indicators suggest that if buying interest grows, ADA’s price might continue to rise towards the resistance levels. Toncoin’s price is trading between $5.18 and $5.45, showing relatively stable movement. The nearest resistance level is at $5.55; breaking through it could push the price toward $5.83. The price has declined by about 9% over the past month. The Relative Strength Index is around 48, indicating a neutral market stance. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is slightly below the current price, suggesting mild upward momentum. If the price falls, the nearest support is at $5.00, with a secondary support at $4.73. Overall, Toncoin’s short-term potential appears balanced, with key levels to watch for possible upward or downward moves.
