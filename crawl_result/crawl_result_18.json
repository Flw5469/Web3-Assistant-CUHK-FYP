    "news_content": "Reddit and Snap beat expectations as users increase, Bitcoin close to a record as U.S. election nears, and more news to start your day. The industry is banking on a friendlier Congress. A win by Donald Trump would be icing on the crypto cake. The large-cap token is trading at its highest level since June as crypto investors gear up for the showdown between Harris and Trump. Investors can get exposure to the cryptocurrency much more cheaply through exchange-traded funds. Barron’s latest Big Money poll finds money managers bullish on earnings, worried about inflation, and buying gold. Some investors in crypto-tied stocks are already partying like the former president is on his way back to the White House. As crypto enters the political stage, the robo-advisor is telling clients that advised accounts will only be able to access crypto through ETFs. Both assets have rallied as central banks cut interest rates and the dollar weakens. Some funds now offer exposure to both assets. The WLFI token has sold less than 5% of its 20 billion token offering since its Tuesday launch. The fake post sent the price of Bitcoin shooting up, only to tumble back. Soaring Bitcoin prices is good news for Bitcoin holder MicroStrategy and other crypto stocks. But the valuations are extremely rich. The large-cap token has flatlined in recent months, and is still trading about $10,000 off its previous record high. Investors are fearing the worst—and it’s driving up the price of assets like gold and Bitcoin, according to a new report from J.P. Morgan. Trump Media shares jumped more than 10% Wednesday morning. The central bank’s decision to slash interest rates by a half point is lifting risk-on assets, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Former President Donald Trump launched his cryptocurrency venture Monday evening and spoke publicly for the first time on the recent apparent assassination attempt. Riot Platforms increased its stake in bitcoin-mining firm Bitfarms, while Cerberus unloaded Frontier stock. Plus, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim bought more shares of oil explorer Talos Energy. The former President said in a post on X on Thursday that his family's crypto project World Liberty Financial will launch next week. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds appear to be losing their shine, with signs of economic weakness spooking cryptocurrency investors.",
