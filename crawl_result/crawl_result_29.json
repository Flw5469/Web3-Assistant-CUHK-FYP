We accept no liability in respect of any material submitted by users and published by us, and we are not responsible for its content and accuracy. The views expressed are the personal opinions of the experts named. They may not represent the views of The Conversation or any other organisation unless specifically stated. The Conversation attempts to provide a range of views from the academic and research community. Users may submit material for publication under the following terms and conditions: You acknowledge that any breach of these conditions may cause us damage or loss. You agree to indemnify us in full and permanently against any third-party liabilities, claims, costs, loss or damage we incur as a result of your breach of conditions (2) to (6) above.

You will be deemed to consent to these guidelines if you choose to post any content or comments to the site. The Conversation is committed to the highest standards of integrity and professional conduct. Authors have a duty to ensure that their work maintains the good name of The Conversation and that of the academic and research community. The Conversation requires authors to disclose any potential conflict of interest. A conflict exists where an individual’s interests diverge from their professional responsibilities such that an independent observer might reasonably conclude that the author has been unduly influenced by their own interest. Publication must include information on the sources of financial and in-kind support for the research, and must reveal actual or potential conflicts of interest. Research, as a general principle, should not be reported before it has been subjected to a recognised process of peer review.

If we wish to bring the agreement to an end, we will do so by emailing you at the address you have registered stating that the agreement has terminated. The agreement will terminate and your email address and password will become invalid on theconversation.com immediately. The Conversation strives to maintain the highest editorial standards at all times. However, we do not always get things right.

Last updated: Feb 2021 In short: if you act with consideration for other users, you should have no problems. Take some responsibility for the quality of the conversations in which you’re participating. Help make this an intelligent place for discussion. All community interaction is subject to some level of moderation to ensure the spirit of the community standards is upheld. What control do authors have on comments? None. Authors can’t moderate comments on their own – or anyone else’s – articles. If an author wants a particular comment removed, he or she should click on the “report abuse” and the comment will be assessed by the moderation team in due course and dealt with accordingly. We reserve the right to take steps or implement measures that we hope will benefit the whole community of participants. Because we are ultimately responsible for everything that appears on this site, all actions and decisions taken by our moderators are final.

    "news_title": "Crypto gains momentum as markets eye Trump election – four things to consider before you invest",
    "news_content": "Director of the Centre for Digital Finance, Associate Professor in Finance, University of Southampton Larisa Yarovaya is affiliated with the British Blockchain Association.  University of Southamptonprovides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Crypto traders are waiting anxiously to see whether it will be the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, or his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, who will be sitting in the White House come January 2025. Harris leads Trump by aslender marginin the national polling averages, but some betting markets have Trump as the favourite to win. According to election gambling sitePolymarket, the chance of Trump winning the election is 67% at the time of writing. These odds will certainly be welcomed by cryptocurrency investors. Trump has previously shown support for crypto, most notably at aBitcoin conference in Nashvillein July, where hevowed to turnthe US into the “crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world”. Indeed, Bitcoin’s price approached athree-month highin October in anticipation of a Trump victory. And cryptocurrency investors believe Bitcoin’s price could surge again, reachinga new highif Trump wins. It may well be an opportune moment to invest in crypto. But cryptocurrency markets are notorious for their volatility and are prone toseveral behavioural anomaliesthat any prospective investor should be aware of. Buying crypto stocks that have recently performed well andshort selling(selling shares that are falling in value, and then buying them back later at a reduced price) those that have performed poorly is often considered a potentially profitable strategy. When buying high-performing stocks, investors anticipate that the positive trend will continue, leading to further price increases. And, in the same vein, investors expect prices to continue declining when short selling those that are performing badly. In crypto circles, as well as in finance more generally, this is called the momentum effect. However,finance theoriessuggest that the complete opposite strategy can, in some instances, yield even better returns. Stocks that are performing well could also be seen as close to exhausting their growth potential, suggesting that a decline is likely to follow. So, some investors may instead buy poorly performing stocks in the expectation that their price will rebound. This strategy, which is called the reversal effect, aims to generate substantial profits as the market corrects itself. By targeting poorly performing cryptocurrencies, large investors in particular can help increaseliquidityfor these assets. Liquidity can be measured simply bytrading volume– the more active traders there are in the market, the easier it is to buy or sell the asset. This should enable greater growth potential. Bitcoin is performing well in anticipation of a Trump victory. But amateur investors should be aware that larger institutional investors may employ different tactics. It is also important to consider that even robust-looking trends can be reversed at any moment. Events like a US presidential election attract the attention of investors, partly due to something called salience bias. Variousstudies suggestthat crypto investors, in particular, tend to focus on a prominent event or a piece of information that is emotionally striking. Rational investment decisions should be based on a balanced assessment of the risk and return of investment assets. But, during an election, crypto investors’ attention is likely to be narrowly focused on polling data or media coverage of the candidates. For newer and less mature markets like cryptocurrency, a reliance on easily accessible information is more common than conducting sophisticated analysis of the underlying financial metrics or economic indicators (fundamentals). This is risky, as all other less prominent yet important information can be easily ignored. The history of cryptocurrency shows numerous collapses, demonstrating thevulnerability of cryptocurrencyas an asset class. In November 2022, for example, thecollapse of FTX, a leading crypto exchange, triggered a major collapse across the entire crypto market. This included a significant decline in Bitcoin’s price. Cryptocurrency markets are subject to significant speculation. Investors hope for big wins, even if the chances are slim. Similar to buying a lottery ticket, investorsmay buy assetsdriven by the illusion of lucrative future profits. This is, of course, also true for some investments in traditional markets. But stories ofBitcoin millionairesand how they quickly made their fortunes create the illusion of the possibility of becoming rich quickly. Such successes are not necessarily replicable in current market conditions. Regardless of the election outcome, cryptocurrency markets will remain highly volatile, speculative and risky. Just because some people win the lottery does not mean that you will. Another behavioural anomaly typical of cryptocurrency markets is theanchoring effect. This is where investors accept and cling to the “anchor” of the first piece of information they receive. For example, if they read an article stating that Bitcoin’s price will rocket after Trump’s victory, they will hold on to this idea regardless of what other sources or information may suggest. This is, again, because the analysis of fundamentals in crypto markets is very challenging. Unlike traditional stocks, which can be evaluated based on factors such as earnings reports and revenue growth, cryptocurrencies often lack similar financial metrics. Hence, crypto investors are particularly susceptible to believing in discussions in the media and various online forums. There have been no details on howTrump’s promiseto make the US the Bitcoin superpower of the world will be delivered. However, it would be hard for crypto investors to change their minds if they are already anchored to this idea. Investing is not gambling. Even if you think your decision is entirely rational, it is essential to triple check to ensure you are not subject to any of the aforementioned behavioural biases. You’ll probably be subject to all of them, as will any other human being. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",

View all partners With technology evolving rapidly, the amount of fraud against seniors is increasing at an alarming rate. Fraud is now theleading crimecommitted against seniors in Canada. Today’s scammers are taking advantage of new technological tools that make their schemes both more credible, and harder to detect. From fraudulent phone calls using voice simulation systems, to sophisticated online hustling, scams are becoming increasingly complex. Despite alerts and warnings, fraud continues to flourish in the age of technology. As an expert in the field of technological fraud, I will try to provide some answers to the following question: Why is fraud against seniors on the risewhen it is so highly publicized?And how can seniors protect themselves? While fraud affects different segments of the population, some specifically targets seniors because of their vulnerability. For example, grandparent fraud, where a fraudster pretends to be a loved one in difficulty, exploits seniors’ trust and encourages them to send money in a hurry. TheCanadian Anti-Fraud Centre(CAFC) has identified 2,494 victims of these schemes, for a total loss of$9.4 million. Romance scam is another common trap. These fraudsters establish an online relationship over an extended period in order to extract money from victims under the pretext of being in financial difficulty, or experiencing a personal emergency. This type of fraud has intensified with modern technology. In 2023 it was responsible for the third-largest financial loss to Canadians, according to theRoyal Canadian Mounted Police. In 2022, Canadians lost more than $59 million to this type of fraud, according toCAFC. Fraudsters also use dating platforms and social networks to create convincing profiles of fictitious identities using stolen photos. Artificial intelligence and image manipulation software are then employed to make these scams all the more realistic, boosting victims’ confidence and making fraud harder to detect. Recent warnings have been issued to alert the Canadian public to romance scams where scammers manipulate their victims into investing infraudulent cryptocurrencies. Phishing, which has also become more sophisticated thanks to new technologies, is another common fraud technique used against seniors, with the CAFC listing losses for Canadians at around$58 millionin 2022. Scammers send e-mails or text messages pretending to be companies or financial institutions and prompt recipients to click on fraudulent links, or divulge personal information. Artificial intelligence and automated systems allow fraudsters to target victims on a massive scale and create a sense of urgency that pushes seniors to act without thinking twice. Fraud targeting seniors is on the rise for a number of reasons. Because seniors often have more free time and are more socially isolated, they are more inclined to respond to calls, e-mails or text messages from strangers. Their solitude also makes fraudulent interactions more credible, while their accessible savings make them attractive targets. Although many seniors use the internet, a large majority are not comfortable with technology. This makes them more vulnerable to online scams. According to one study, while 67 per cent of seniors surf the internet regularly,only 26 per centfeel very confident using computers and smartphones. Seniors continue to fall into these traps despitenumerous awareness campaigns, since fraudsters skilfully exploit seniors’ lack of familiarity with digital technologies and constantly adapt their methods to circumvent warnings. What’s more, the emotional impact of a well-crafted scam can override caution, making warnings less effective in these situations. To protect themselves from fraud, there are a number of essential behaviours seniors must adopt. They should never share personal information, such as PINs or passwords, by telephone, e-mail or text message. It’s also important not to respond to any unsolicited offers whether they are received by e-mail, text or telephone. If a specific case requires action, it’s best to type the financial institution’s web address, rather than click on a link provided. Seniors should never make hasty decisions. If a child or grandchild claims to be in an emergency and is asking for financial assistance, seniors should ask them personal questions to verify their identity. Finally, trusting one’s intuition remains essential: if something seems suspicious, it’s best to heed your gut and take extra precautions. At a time when technology is advancing rapidly, fraudsters have never been better equipped to target the elderly. Although seniors are increasingly connected, being less familiar with digital tools makes them all the more vulnerable. Scams — whether romantic scams, phishing or telephone fraud — exploit their trust and isolation. Because of this threat, it’s crucial to inform and educate seniors so they can protect themselves against these increasingly sophisticated scams. But prevention is not enough: collective awareness is also necessary. By supporting our seniors, we can help reduce fraud and better protect this vulnerable population. Collective awareness means making sure the community is committed to monitoring, alerting and protecting those who are most at risk. This can be achieved through concrete actions carried out on a regular basis to raise awareness among seniors, but also by encouraging seniors’ loved ones to be alert to signs of potential fraud. It would also be a good idea to involve local players, such as financial institutions or community centres, to offer ongoing training and reminders about common frauds. In the long run, it is only by combining prevention, education and solidarity that we will be able to truly limit the impact of this fraud, and offer seniors the protection they deserve in an increasingly digital world.

    "news_title": "Can cryptocurrencies ever be green?",
    "news_content": "Lecturer in Finance, Salford Business School, University of Salford Jean Bessala does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.  University of Salfordprovides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners Cryptocurrencies have been condemned over their environmental record at a time when \ntraditional investments have beenrapidlymoving towards greener environmental, social and governance (ESG) values. So how long will it be until crypto earns its green credentials? Green investments are assets like bonds that pay for projects with positive environmental and social outcomes.Green bondsfor example, contribute to cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, an increase of renewable energy capacity and uptake in clean transport infrastructures. Crypto investments on the other hand are widely seen as environmentally unfriendly, mainly because of crypto mining and the huge energy it demands. Mining in the context of crypto refers to a mechanism called “proof of work”(POW)where crypto “miners” use specialised computers to solve complex mathematical equations to secure transactions and create new coins. This is where the energy use comes in. Agencies and organisations like theInternational Energy Agencyand theUnited Nationshave raised concerns about the effects of crypto mining – particularly Bitcoin, the best-known crypto asset. The United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health estimated that in 2020-2021,Bitcoin networkshad significant carbon, water and land footprints. Bitcoin’s carbon footprint was equivalent to burning 38 billion tonnes of coal, while its water footprint (mainly used for cooling systems) would have met the domestic water needs of more than 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. TheCambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Indexputs the electricity consumption of Bitcoin networks above those of several developed countries, including Norway and Sweden. For investors who are serious about achieving ESG goals, this aspect of crypto would likely be a deal-breaker. It is also made difficult by the lack of regulations around crypto activities. After years of being on the fringes of financial markets and being considered a “get-rich-quick” venture, crypto investments are becoming mainstream. But there is still littleregulationto protect investors and ensure participants adopt practices that are in line with ESG values. Sceptics point out themajor issuesplaguing these markets including the use of cryptocurrencies and platforms for money-laundering, scamming, and price manipulation. So it is certainly hard to make a green case for crypto. But at the same time, it would be misleading to look only at one side of the coin. The fact is that crypto has a challenging but reachable path towards being widely accepted as green. First and foremost, the industry itself has recognised the need to change practices and processes to become more sustainable. In 2021, a significant number of players in the crypto industry signed the crypto climate accord(CCA)with the long-term target of decarbonising the global crypto industry by 2040. The CCA set two interim objectives. The first was the development of standards and technologies to have 100% renewably powered blockchains as soon as 2025. The second aim states that signatories should achieve net-zero emissions from electricity consumption by 2030. Recent developments in technology suggest the industry has started putting plans into action, with the appearance of sustainable tools and infrastructures. Several companies such asMaraandArgoare working on technologies like energy-efficient immersion cooling systems that significantly reduce the energy consumption required for mining. These companies are also developing systems that can recycle heat produced by digital assets and from data centres, andredirect itto provide energy to communities. The implementation of these technologies is facilitated by the relative mobility of crypto miners and the opportunities that some governments andregionsoffer to them. In addition, the crypto industry has seen the emergence of self-proclaimed environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies, such asCardanopublic blockchain andPowerledger. These currencies use a less energy-intensive mechanism called “proof-of-stake” (POS) rather than POW. Unlike POW, POS miners must stake their holdings (the amount of cryptocurrency) when validating and verifying transactions and records. So if a miner tries to falsify records, they could potentially lose their stake. The process removes the need for the complex computer calculations and so cuts the energy use dramatically. In fact, in 2022, the cryptocurrencyEthereumtransitioned from POW to POS, reducing its energy consumption by nearly 100%. The path towards green crypto is being eased by institutions like theFinancial Stability Board, which is taking steps to provide frameworks for understanding, compliance and achievements of ESG goals and values. Together, these elements could open the door to a future where conscious investors can take a chance on cryptocurrencies. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",

University of Adelaideprovides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners We’ve just seen how quickly market turbulence can spread across the world of finance. At the start of the week, fears of a US recession and a Japanese interest rate hike sent shockwaves across equity markets, currency markets (also known as forex markets) and bond markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average – an index that tracks a range of US shares –fellby more than 1,000 points. Japan’s stock market suffered its worst fall in 37 years. But amid all the chaos, some of the largest losses accrued to one of the most volatile of markets – cryptocurrencies. Bitcoinfellby 15% in just 24 hours, and Ethereum by 22%. Many global markets – includingcrypto– have nowrebounded somewhatsince the crash. Whether we’re out of the woods yet remainsunclear. But why is it that seemingly unrelated assets, such as stocks and crypto, seem to crash at the same time? And what does it mean for attempts to diversify risk? Read more:Fear gripped global markets this week – but was it all overblown? Much of the dip we saw in US markets at the start of the week was driven by two things: a weaker-than-expected US job market, andmissed earnings forecastsfor a few large US tech stocks. These factors led US investors to reassess their projections of future cash flows and triggered a selloff in equity markets, especially tech and AI-related sectors. Globally, we also saw anunexpected interest rate hikeby the Bank of Japan against the backdrop of a looming expected rate cut in the United States. This made what’s called the “carry trade” – borrowing in Japanese yen (the low interest rate currency) and lending in US dollars (or other higher-interest-rate currencies) – far less profitable, prompting hedge fund investors to unwind their positions. In crypto markets, investors are used to sharp price fluctuations. Crypto volatility is typically an order of magnitude greater than that of traditional asset classes like stocks. But the single day drop in Bitcoin’s price was large, even by crypto standards. US tech sector investors are in a seemingly different corner of the financial world from the hedge funds engaging in the Japanese yen carry trade. And crypto investors sometimes seem like they are in a different investment universe altogether. But in financial markets, the “butterfly effect” – the idea that seemingly small events can have big consequences – is the rule, rather than the exception. One reason is that large investors who lose money in one market often need cash quickly, which they get by selling in other markets. For example, traders might get “margin calls” on their positions. In simple terms, this means they are forced to come up with cash to cover a losing “bet” on which way a stock price will move. They may have to sell other assets in their portfolio to raise funds quickly. When multiple other assets get sold at the same time, prices go down in tandem. But you have to move serious amounts of money to have this effect on the global stage. So who are these market players large enough to make asset classes move together? In current markets, they tend to be multi-strategy hedge funds, large institutional investors that take huge positions across different types of assets. In the past, especially during the global financial crisis, this group has also included large investment banks. Financial markets now are more interconnected than ever before, meaning market crashes can happen faster and affect a wider range of assets. Amid contagion-prone traditional assets, Bitcoin once seemed to offer something different – true diversification. In the past, we have seen periods ofrelatively low correlationsbetween movements in the price of Bitcoin and shares. But this correlation canvary wildlyand has often been positive. Recentresearchhas found that investors’ risk appetite, as well as interest rates and the idiosyncratic demand for crypto are three key factors driving crypto prices.

This could help explain why Bitcoin and Ethereum crashed when investors’ risk appetite dropped amid fears of a US recession. And the risk appetite factor may be becoming more pronounced, with Bitcoin more plugged into the traditional financial system after the launch of multipleBitcoin “exchange-traded funds” (ETFs). As more and more institutional investors come to hold Bitcoin through instruments like ETFs, we could see crypto and other assets “co-move” – move together –more. A key principle of responsible investment strategy is diversification – in a nutshell, making sure you don’t put all your eggs in one investment basket. Investing in assets that co-move less with the rest of the market can help lower the overall riskiness of a portfolio. Crypto assets used to be considered such an asset. Monday’s crypto crash – which coincided with the bloodbath in global share markets – signals we may need to reassess that idea. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",

View all partners Donald Trump’s recent embrace of cryptocurrencyat the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville marks a significant shift from the former U.S. president’s earlier skepticism. Once a vocal critic, Trump now positions himself as a champion of digital assets, reflecting the broader convergence of politics and crypto in what isincreasingly referred to as “PolitiFi.” But even though Trump’s pivot garnered significant attention, it’s essential to explore how stances on cryptocurrency regulation could influence some voters in the United States leading up to the 2024 presidential election. Historically, President Joe Biden’s administration and prominent Democrats, includingSen. Elizabeth Warren, have expressed concerns about cryptocurrencies, focusing on risks related to consumer protection, financial stability and the potential for money laundering. Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has played a key role in this stance.He’s advocated for treating many crypto assets as securities, thereby subjecting them to strict regulations similar to those governing stocks and bonds. But the rising influence of cryptocurrencies has led to a shift within the Democratic Party. The passage of theFinancial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) in May 2024 — with considerable support from Democrats— indicates a growing recognition of digital assets’ importance. Despite the Biden administration’s initial opposition to FIT21, there is now a willingness to work with regulators to develop a balanced regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee,has not yet taken a definitive stance on crypto policy.But her campaign has engaged with crypto representatives, and there is increasing pressure from pro-crypto Democrats for her to adopt a more favourable approach. This push is part of a broader effort to ensure that Trump does not dominate the crypto issue, which has become increasingly significant in the election due to its potential impact on campaign financing and voter engagement. The Democratic Party is divided on cryptocurrency regulation. While figures like Warren continue to emphasize the dangers of digital assets, others within the party are advocating for a more open approach. Congressman Brad Sherman, for instance, hasexpressed concerns that FIT21could create a competitor to the U.S. dollar that might be exploited by criminals. On the other hand,pro-crypto Democrats are urging Harris to recognize the potential of digital assetsand engage with the industry in a more constructive manner. This internal debate within the Democratic Party reflects the broader tension between innovation and regulation. As cryptocurrencies gain traction, the challenge for the party is to balance these competing interests while safeguarding consumers and the financial system. Harris’s stance on crypto regulation could determine whether wealthy industry leaders contribute to her campaign and could help mobilize younger, tech-savvy voters who are increasingly engaged with digital assets. The establishment ofCrypto4Harris, a group dedicated to enhancing Harris’s appeal on cryptocurrency issues, underscores the importance of this topic in the upcoming election. The group’s efforts, including organizing town hall events with high-profile supporters like billionaire Mark Cuban, aim to counter Trump’s influence on the crypto issue and strengthen Harris’s ties with the digital asset community. Tim Walz, Harris’s running mate, has not yet made a public statement on cryptocurrency, though his past interactions with the industry,including returning donations from FTX executives, suggest a cautious approach. While Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrency has been widely publicized, it is important to consider the context of this shift. Trump’s newfound enthusiasm for digital assets could bemore transactional than ideological, as much of his political activity is driven by opportunism. His pivot to a crypto-friendly stance comes at a time when he is seeking to energize his base and attract campaign contributions from wealthy industry leaders who are heavily invested in the crypto space. This approach highlights the intersection of cryptocurrency regulation and campaign financing, with Trump trying to position himself to capture the financial support of the digital asset community. However, it’s worth noting that Trump isfacing ongoing legal challenges, andhis poll numbers are declining, raising questions about the sustainability of his political strategy. Nonetheless, his focus on cryptocurrency could appeal to younger voters who are engaged with digital assets.  The 2024 election is shaping up to be a pivotal moment for the future of cryptocurrency in the U.S. While Trump’s embrace of digital assets has brought the issue to the forefront, there are broader political dynamics at play. Biden, Harris and other key figures are all grappling with how to approach this rapidly evolving industry. As the lines between technology and politics continue to blur, the decisions made in the coming months will most likely have far-reaching implications for the future of digital assets and their role in the global economy.

    "news_title": "Make Bitcoin great again – what Donald Trump’s backing of crypto could mean for the industry",
    "news_content": "Director of the Centre for Digital Finance, Associate Professor in Finance, University of Southampton Larisa Yarovaya is affiliated with the British Blockchain Association.  University of Southamptonprovides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency infamous for its price volatility andenvironmental impact, has become a focal point of the US presidential campaign. On July 27, the former US president and Republican nominee for the upcoming election, Donald Trump,headlinedthe biggest Bitcoin conference of the year in Nashville. In his speech, Trumpclaimedhe will make the US the “crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world” if returned to the White House after November’s election. His comments were met with rapturous applause from the crowd. Trump’s courting of the crypto industry is almost certainly a political move. The Trump campaign hasraised US$25 million(£19.6 million) from the sector since it startedaccepting cryptocurrency donationsin May, and it is expected to receive even more following the event in Nashville. His public backing of crypto undoubtedly boosted investor optimism. The price of Bitcoinsurgedto almost US$70,000 on July 29, its highest level in more than six weeks, before dropping back to US$62,000 a few days later. But questions remain about thefeasibility of Trump’s promisesif he becomes president. And, even then, it is unclear whether Trump’s pro-crypto agenda will have a sustained effect on the price of Bitcoin in the long term. Bitcoin’s price surged and fell within a week In his speech, Trumppledgedto keep “100% of all the Bitcoin” the US government currently holds or acquires in the future if he is elected. Many countries, including the US,hold Bitcoin. A large part of these holdings are Bitcoin that has been seized from criminals. The question of how to handle this confiscated cryptocurrency is complex. Not selling it may send a conflicting message to victims of cryptocurrency crime. Chinese fraud victims, for example, have previously urged the UK government to return£3 billion in Bitcoinheld by London police. If governments truly want to protect consumers fromfraud and cybercrimein cryptocurrency markets, recovering stolen Bitcoin should be part of their actions. Thus, Trump’s promise to keep all of America’s Bitcoin holdings may not be practical. Besides that, Bitcoin was designed initially as a decentralised currency. Its key attraction was that it would operate independently from any central authority. Since its inception in 2009, the degree of decentralisation has decreased. Alarge amount of Bitcoinis now held by major mining pools – groups of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of successfully “mining” new Bitcoins. Adding significant government holdings in Bitcoin could lead to an even greater concentration of power among large players. This is probably not what most cryptocurrency users desire. The lack of regulatory clarity is another major obstacle to the mass adoption of Bitcoin and other blockchain-based innovations. From this perspective, Trump’s pro-crypto agenda could be welcomed by the crypto community, as he may create a more favourable environment in the US for cryptocurrency miners, startups and other crypto entrepreneurs. At the Nashville conference, Trumpcriticisedunclear and overly strict US laws, promised to fire the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler who is unpopular in crypto circles for his antagonistic stance towards the industry, and warned that the crypto community would be crushed if Kamala Harris is elected. Trumpsaid: “We will have regulations, but from now on the rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” However, the specifics of how these new “crypto-friendly” regulators will achieve their goals if Trump is elected remain unclear. In 2023, the SEC led major investigations into crypto’s main troublemakers. The founder of the now bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried, for instance, wassentenced to 25 years in prisonfor fraud and was ordered to forfeit US$11.2 billion. The US has the power to make the field safer for all stakeholders. But whether these anti-crime measures will continue under a new crypto-friendly government led by Trump remains uncertain. Regardless of uncertainty about who will take office in November, there are other concerns for cryptocurrency users about government Bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin’s volatility is in part driven by governments selling their Bitcoin holdings – the price of Bitcoin hasfallen by 15%since Germany started selling off approximately €2.5 billion of confiscated Bitcoin at the beginning of June. But Bitcoin is also a highly speculative asset that is extremely sensitive to media coverage, news and even social media announcements. The stance of the US government on Bitcoin’s environmental issues, which are the subject of much media criticism, would also affect its price in the long term. Bitcoin mining typically uses vast amounts of computing power to solve various mathematical puzzles and add new tokens to the blockchain. It is a process that consumes anastonishing amountof electricity and water, and produces large quantities of electronic waste. The US government hadlaunchedan initiative in January 2024 aimed at surveying the energy use of mining operations. However, the move wasblockedby a federal judge in Texas who said the industry would suffer“irreparable injury”if the new requirements were imposed. Trump’s promise to support Bitcoin mining in the US may well be received negatively by communities suffering from Bitcoin’s vast resource consumption. In Texas, for example, households are already facinghigher electricity costsin areas where Bitcoin is mined on a large scale. The future of Bitcoin depends on the global political agendas of key countries, including the US. But there are multiple factorsdriving Bitcoin’s priceirrespective of government regulation, so any promises should be interpreted with caution. For Trump’s pledges to affect Bitcoin’s price in the long term, they must be backed by substantial and consistent measures. Otherwise, they will simply cause temporary price fluctuations like those seen over the past week. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",

University of Southamptonprovides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Japan’s stock marketplunged 12% on Monday, August 5 – its worst day in 37 years. The severity of the falltriggered lossesin stock markets around the world. In the US, for example, the Nasdaq index dropped more than 6%, while the S&P 500 dipped by 4.25%. Markets have sincereboundedslightly. The Nasdaq climbed 1.5% on Tuesday, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 10.2% higher than at the start of the day. But there may still bebumpy weeks ahead. A key reason for these bearish markets isfear of a slowdownin the US economy. US job market data published on August 2 reported thehighest unemployment ratesince October 2021 alongside weaker than expected job growth. This has caused pessimism to spread among investors about an impending recession in the world’s biggest economy. The chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, hassuggestedthat an interest rate cut can be expected in September. Lower interest rates typically mean cheaper borrowing and should boost economic growth. However, July’s cooling of the US job market has led to speculation that the Fed haswaited too longto act. The central banks of other developed economies, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, havealready cut interest rates. Shares of tech companies, both in the US and elsewhere,were also down. And cryptocurrency markets went into decline as well. The price of crypto market leader, Bitcoin, dippedbelow US$50,000(£39,000) after trading close to a record US$70,000 just one week ago. Other crypto tokens, such as Solana and Dogecoin, also experienced a drop ofup to 30%in price over the same period. Read more:Make Bitcoin great again – what Donald Trump's backing of crypto could mean for the industry This cryptocurrency sell-off has been largely attributed to the same fears of a US recession that caused the stock market to briefly crash. However, from a financial perspective, this contagion effect is particularly interesting. Cryptocurrency was designed to be independent from any centralised authority. It was intended to offer an alternative form of money and an investment asset immune to the flaws of the traditional financial system. This was true to some extent before 2017, during the early days of crypto adoption. According toresearchpublished in 2018, cryptocurrency markets were relatively isolated and “decoupled” from traditional markets. However, cryptocurrencies have over time become more integrated into the financial system and are no longer immune to volatility spillovers from non-crypto markets. Separateresearchhas analysed Bitcoin’s response to US interest rate announcements and found that the intensity of the response to monetary policy news depends on the type of digital asset. Cryptocurrencies that are closely related to “currency” in their function, such as Bitcoin, should respond strongly to the Fed’s announcements. These cryptocurrencies are used heavily for financial transactions and, therefore, are likely to be sensitive to changes in consumer demand and the overall economic environment. Both of these factors are influenced by monetary policy. On the other hand, so-called crypto protocols like Ethereum primarily serve as platforms upon which a variety of crypto products can be built, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In theory, a protocol’s price should have a slower and less severe response to monetary policy announcements compared to “pure” cryptocurrencies. However, crypto assets across all categories have experienced a unified downfall over the past week. The price ofEthereum, for example, fell to its lowest point of 2024 on August 5, showing that financial panic can transmit quickly and efficiently across all markets. Crypto’s popular appeal of decentralisation and independence from traditional finance simply does not hold. The value of a cryptocurrency is also largely driven by investor sentiment, with news and social media announcements playing a crucial role in shaping this. So, it’s possible that cryptocurrencies respond even more severely to such shocks than stock markets themselves. Crypto assets are volatile, which makes them appealing to some investors who embrace risk. Current prices may be low, but crypto investors are accustomed to volatility and, as with every dip, are evaluating whether now is a good time to buy. The problem is that technical analysis — interpreting up and down price trends — is often highly inaccurate in any market. And prices may still have room to fall further given that cryptocurrencies have only dipped below their all-time highs. Early academicresearchon cryptocurrency bubbles concluded that, as crypto has no fundamental value, Bitcoin’s true price is zero. This idea may seem far-fetched today. But a complete collapse in value remains a plausible scenario in the future for many crypto tokens. Any new information, such as interest rate announcements, political eventslike the US election, or the further adoption of crypto assets by institutional investors, can rapidly alter the direction of crypto prices.

Queensland University of Technology,Griffith University, andUniversity of Queenslandprovide funding as members of The Conversation AU. View all partners Cryptocurrencies and other digital assets have enjoyed an astonishing rise into mainstream consciousness in recent years. Despite all the hype – perhaps partly because of it – investing in them can still expose us to serious risks. Last year, Australians lostA$2.74 billionto scams. Investment scams topped the list of ways we were fleeced, costing us $1.3 billion in total. Within this category, cryptocurrency investment scams are a significant problem. And losses from other types of scam areoften processedthrough cryptocurrency exchanges to make them difficult to trace. Many Australiansstill don’t knowhow to safely purchase cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), let alone how to store them securely. This has presented a huge opportunity for scammers. Read more:Australians lose $5,200 a minute to scammers. There's a simple thing the government could do to reduce this. Why won't they? By engaging with Australian crypto investors themselves, our recently publishedresearchsought to investigate who is vulnerable to such scams, and what vulnerabilities exist across the sector more broadly. We identified two very different groups that are most at risk, and we suggest that targeted education may be needed to reduce these dangers. Wesurveyed745 Australian adults who had purchased cryptocurrencies or NFTs. We recruited participants of various ages (18 and above) and from a wide range of socioeconomic, educational and ethnic backgrounds. Though our survey sample had more female participants, we found no significant gender difference in who was investing in cryptocurrencies. But when it came to NFTs, we found participants from three groups were more likely to purchase the digital assets: non-Indigenous Australians, university-educated Australians, and the full-time employed. Read more:What are NFTs and why are people paying millions for them? Our survey asked 40 questions, three of which focused specifically on the participants’ crypto literacy – regarding how to calculate interest, the tax treatment of selling cryptocurrencies, and the importance of private keys in storing blockchain assets. Our findings revealed that two very different groups were most vulnerable to cryptocurrency investment scams. The first of these groups possessed some features of socioeconomic disadvantage. This included being female, identifying as Indigenous, having only high-school education or lower, working part-time or casual hours, or speaking a language other than English at home. This group was vulnerable because participants were influenced by social media hype surrounding such investments but often lacked sufficient financial or IT literacy to properly navigate the space. There was some other notable findings within this group. Indigenous Australians were the group most vulnerable to losing their cryptocurrency or NFT investments. Alarmingly, female participants were found to be more susceptible to media hype around these investments, but tended not to answer any of the crypto literacy questions correctly. And participants who spoke English as a second language had poorer knowledge about the security of their digital assets and how to calculate interest. Perhaps surprisingly, the other most vulnerable group we identified came from anadvantagedsocioeconomic background. Participants who fell into this group were non-Indigenous, university-educated, employed full-time or owned their home with a mortgage. These participants also had sufficient financial literacy and IT literacy. So why was this group also so prone to scams? It’s likely overconfidence played a role. Many members of this group may assume they are too savvy to fall victim to crypto investment scams, when in fact such ambition and overconfidence can actually expose them to greater risks. In financial literacy literature, overconfidence has been previously shown to put an individual atgreater riskof harm. More generally, we found some of the biggest vulnerabilities for Australians were insufficient financial and technological literacy, security concerns, and the provision of unsolicited advice. But there was also a serious lack of reliable educational resources. Social media was the number-one place where participants learned about cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Schools were the last place. The growing popularity of these investments calls on the education system to engage with the topic and teach basic skills. We recommend students are exposed to what financial literacy researcher Dr Carly Sawatzki refers to as “financial dilemmas” inhigh schools, TAFE and universities settings. This will help them learn and critically unpack what they are hearing and watching about cryptocurrencies and NFTs via social media. Australians need access to better education on storing their crypto and NFTs safely, understanding the tax implications of buying and selling crypto investments, calculating interest for investment decision-making purposes, and the importance of seeking independent professional advice.

    "news_content": "Senior Lecturer, Canberra School of Politics, Economics and Society, University of Canberra John Hawkins was formerly a senior economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank for International Settlements  University of Canberraprovides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners More than 90% of the world’s central banks are looking at introducing acentral bank digital currency(CBDC), to complement existing banknotes. A CBDC isnota new currency. It is a digital representation of an existing national currency. So an Australian CBDC would have exactly the same value as an Australian dollar. It would be legal tender. It could be available in both retail and wholesale formats but usage would be optional and it would not replace hard currency. Retail CBDCs are likely to allow point-of-sale purchases, government payments and transfers between individuals. Central banks are still considering many design features but most think their retail CBDCs won’t pay interest. Like the banknotes in our wallets, the CBDC we could spend using our phones would be issued by the Reserve Bank. But it would enable more sophisticated and innovative types of financial transactions, such as “smart contracts”, than existing forms of electronic money such as credit cards. The wholesale version, by contrast, would only be available to financial institutions. They would be comparable to the deposit (“exchange settlement”) accounts these institutions currently hold with the central bank. The strong interest in CBDCs has been revealed in a recentreportby the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) which surveyed 86 central banks. While the BIS report shows 94% of central banks are considering CBDCs, with about one third running pilot projects, most are being cautious and do not expect to issue their own digital currency in the next few years.  Retail CBDCs are already being used in several countries. The first was the so-called “sand dollar”, launched by the Central Bank of the Bahamas in 2020. The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank also launched a CBDC, called DCash, in 2021. Nigeria and Jamaica also have CBDCs. The major economy most advanced in work on a retail CBDC is China. The digital yuan, ore-CNY, has been widely trialled. A possible Bank of England CBDC, ordigital pound, has been nicknamed a “Britcoin” but no decision has yet been taken about whether it will go ahead. If it does, it will require a vote in parliament and would then take afew yearsto introduce. Central banks might be motivated to adopt CBDCs to preserve the role of central bank money. This would help ensure monetary policy remains an effective tool for managing the economy. CBDCs might also make cross-border payments faster and cheaper. This is especially helpful in countries where many families rely onremittancesfrom members working overseas. Countries where a large proportion of the population don’t have bank accounts may see scope for improving financial inclusion. One concern is that a retail CBDC might replace commercial bank accounts. Bank customers might transfer funds from banks to the absolute safety of a CBDC. This could facilitate illegal activity because, like banknotes, CBDCs may be fully anonymous. But there may be privacy concerns if, to avoid this, people have to register to use a CBDC. A smart contract involves an instant payment made simultaneously with, and conditional on, the transfer of ownership of an asset. Vending machinesprovide a good analogy.  If you insert $2 and press B4, then the machine dispenses the cookies in the B4 slot. In other words, if (and only if) the vending machine receives the required item of value, then it instantly performs the requested action. So far, smart contracts have mainly been used for purchases of digital assets such asNFTs. In principle they could be used for buying shares or houses to ensure that the transfer of ownership happens automatically and simultaneously with the payment being made. If they are to be used for important transactions such as buying shares and homes the payment needs to made using something whose value will not fluctuate between the time a customer decides to buy and when the transaction takes place. Most discussion of smart contracts has suggested they could be based on so-calledstablecoins, such as Tether and USDC. This form of cryptocurrency purports to hold reserves in high quality assets and therefore can maintain parity with a national currency such as the US dollar. In practice, stablecoins are rarely used for payments outside the crypto ecosystem, and one major Australian bank, the National Australia Bank, has justabandoned its stablecoin project. Even Meta/Facebook, with its deep pockets and enormous customer base, gave up on itsLibra/Diem stablecoin project. But a CBDC could provide atrustworthy basis for smart contracts. As the BIS’ chief economist Hyun Song Shinput it, “anything that crypto can do CBDCs can do better”. Australia’s Reserve Bank has so far been cautious about issuing a CBDC. Then governor Philip Lowesaid in 2021“we have not seen a strong public policy case to move in this direction, especially given Australia’s efficient, fast and convenient electronic payments system”. As more than 99% of Australian adultshave a bank account, the financial inclusion motive does not apply here. And few Australian families rely on international remittances. Also, Australia’s payments system has been improved over recent years. There is no sign of stablecoins or other crypto making a meaningful challenge to the use of the Australian dollar for payments. But the Reserve appears to have become more interested of late. Anassistant governorsaid last year a CBDC could “spur innovation” and a study conducted jointly by the Reserve Bank and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre has identifiedpossible uses, including smart contracts, faster settlement of financial transactions and a back-up payments system. The Bank will bereleasing a paper soonsetting out a “roadmap for future work”. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",

    "news_content": "Lecturer, University of Adelaide Marta Khomyn does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.  University of Adelaideprovides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has just seen thelistingof its first bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund – “ETF” for short. Issued by investment management firm VanEck, the new investment product is trading under the ticker symbol “VBTC”. It’s not the first bitcoin ETF to launch in Australia, others have been available for some time on the smaller exchange Cboe Australia. But it is a first for the ASX, our largest stock exchange. If international experience is anything to go by, the ASX’s new bitcoin spot ETF is likely to draw significant interest and could be the first of many similar products. In January, American investment manager BlackRocklauncheda similar product in the US – “IBIT” – which has since grown to manage almostA$30 billionin assets. As Australia braces for a possible flood of new mainstream cryptocurrency investment products, it is important to know more about how they work and what risks they might entail. Read more:What do I need to know before investing in ETFs and what are the risks? ETFs are investment products that track the performance of an underlying asset. Like shares, they can be traded on a public stock exchange. But buying an ETF is like buying a basket of different investments, the contents of which can vary. Bitcoin or gold ETFs, for example, track the price of just one commodity. But equity ETFs can track whole collections of stocks, combined in proportions that reflect a particular index. It is important to understand the difference between “spot” ETFs which actually hold their underlying investments, and “futures” ETFs which invest in derivative securities to approximate the performance of their nominal investments. For example, BlackRock’s IBIT product is aspotETF, because it invests in bitcoin directly. A different ETF – ProShares “BITO” – is afuturesETF, because it invests in bitcoin futures (contracts to buy or sell bitcoin at a future date) in a way that tracks the price of the underlying asset. Bitcoin ETFs are gaining momentum because they allow traditional investors to access a popular asset class that is still largely unregulated. Unlike buying cryptocurrency directly, the transaction is mediated by a large ETF issuer and takes place through a regulated stock exchange. But they also create new costs, including management fees that can significantly impact returns. In the US, the watershed moment for spot bitcoin ETFs came on January 10 this year, when the US Securities and Exchange Commissionapproved11 of them. These funds have sinceaccumulatedmore than A$75 billion in combined assets under management, and BlackRock’s IBIT – the most liquid (easiest to buy and sell) – regularly seesmore than A$1 billion in tradesin a day. In comparison, existing Australian bitcoin ETFs are orders of magnitude smaller in scale. Global X’s “EBTC”, which has traded on Cboe Australia since 2022, manages just overA$100 millionin assets and sees a mere fraction of the trade volume. This means liquidity – the ease with which an asset can be bought, sold and converted to cash – is much higher in the US. The contrast between the US and Australia on this front is driven in large part by the different degree of involvement by institutional investors. Ease of trade means big asset management funds around the world are more likely to trade in the US, further fuelling total assets under management over there. This institutional involvement in bitcoin markets has become substantial. Some 12.5% of the currency’s 21 million coin supply cap is nowheld by just 90 institutional entities, including countries, publicly traded companies and ETFs. For huge institutional investors trading millions or billions of dollars at a time, liquidity is typically the main cost consideration when trading ETFs. Low liquidity can make it harder to buy and sell at a favourable price. But for smaller retail investors it’s management fees. A management fee of 1% per year means that if an investment grows from $100 to $105 over the course of the year, an investor will only end up with $104 in their account. $1 goes to the ETF issuer. It might not seem like a lot, but for a buy-and-hold investor, small differences in management fees can matter a lot. For example, over ten years, a hypothetical starting investment of $10,000 with a constant annual return of 5% would earn $1,178 less by investing in an ETF with a 1% management fee compared to one with a 0.2% management fee. Today’s ASX listing has already ignited a management fees “price war” between VanEck and rival bitcoin ETF provider Global X. Global X will reduce their ETF’s management fee to 0.59% from July, to match VanEck’s new offering. But in the US, many bitcoin ETFs have lower fees, some in the range of0.2%-0.25%. The Australian market for bitcoin ETFs is smaller and – for now – significantly less competitive than its US counterpart. Depending on the success of new launches like today’s, market dynamics will reveal whether the Australian market will eventually see lower fees, more liquidity, and other ETF issuers joining the Australian offerings. That could end up hinging on the uptake of these ETFs by retail investors, as major institutions continue to face fewer hurdles in the US. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",

View all partners As the urgency of climate change ramps up, focus is increasing on digital currencies to address their environmental impact. According to industry forecasts, the global cryptocurrency market is expected to surge toUS$4.94 billion by 2030. But the process of mining digital currencies such asBitcoinrequires immense computational power – causing a significant drain on energy resources. “Miners” use sophisticated hardware to solve complex mathematical puzzles, securing transactions and minting new coins. But this process, known as “proof of work” (PoW), is energy intensive. Imagine a giant lock with a million combinations. Miners are all competing to find the right combination to unlock the block (a group of transactions) and earn rewards. The more computing power you have, the faster you can try different combinations. But this computing power requires a lot of energy, similar to how a powerful car uses more petrol. So, miners are using a massive amount of electricity to run super-powered computers 24/7. In 2021,police in the United Kingdom raided an industrial unitunder suspicion it was housing an indoor marijuana growing operation. They were surprised to discover instead an extensive Bitcoin mining setup which was illegally siphoning electricity from a mains supply. In 2021, Bitcoin mining consumed enough energy to rank 27th among nations, ahead of Pakistan with a population of over 230 million people. Just a year later, Bitcoin’s energy usagesurpassed Finland’s national power consumption. Alternatives have emergedto address the rampant energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining. But the question is, are these green currencies a viable alternative to the traditional options?  Green cryptocurrencies use a less energy-intensive process known as “proof of stake” (PoS). Instead of needing a powerful computer, miners need to have a certain amount of the relevant cryptocurrency – kind of like a deposit. If someone tries to cheat or mess with the system, they could lose some of their own cryptocurrency. This “skin in the game” keeps validators – those validating and verifying transactions – honest and secure. A pivotal moment for those interested in green alternatives was cryptocurrency Ethereum’smigration to PoSin September 2022, through an update dubbed “The Merge”. This shift led to a 99.9% drop in Ethereum’s energy use. Before the transition, Ethereum’s energy consumption was on par with Switzerland. Post-merge, its power usage wascloser to that of a small town. In addition to Ethereum, several other cryptocurrencies are making significant strides in the realm of green finance. Notably,Cardano and Solana are gaining groundin the crypto market. They use significantly less energy, can handle larger numbers of transactions without slowing down, and claim to be secure. Despite the benefits, the shift to green cryptocurrencies is fraught with challenges. Some users worryPoS might be less secure than PoW. And those with more coins have a higher chance of validating transactions. This could lead to a situation wherea few people control the network. Moreover, the initial distribution of coins in cryptocurrencies using PoS can be less democratic, often benefiting early adopters. As a result, early adopters who accumulate a large number of coins can have a disproportionate influence on the network. This can be seen as less democratic because it gives more power to the wealthy, which goes against thedecentralised ethos of cryptocurrencies. PoS is not the only change attempting to address cryptocurrencies’ energy consumption.Shardingis another. Sharding divides the network into smaller sections called “shards”, each handling its own set of transactions. This frees up individual computers on the network (called nodes) from processing everything at once, leading to significantly faster transaction speeds and lower costs. This innovation goes beyond just efficiency. Sharding’s parallel processing approach minimises energy needs, potentially making cryptocurrencies more eco-friendly. Ethereum’s upcoming upgrade,Ethereum 2.0, incorporates sharding to address the network’s current limitations on speed and transaction fees. By implementing sharding in phases, developers hope to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining the network’s security and decentralisation. While sharding seems like a game-changer, it’s not without its own hurdles. Implementing it effectively requires careful planning and rigorous testing to safeguard the network’s integrity. Overall, sharding offers a glimpse into a future where cryptocurrencies can process transactions faster, become more cost-effective and even reduce their environmental impact. Green cryptocurrencies show how technology and finance can support ecological sustainability, providing a model for others to follow. But there is always a risk. And as they develop, green cryptocurrencies need to address concerns over security, network integrity and accessibility. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",

University of East Londonprovides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission isconsidering tightercontrols to combat illegal trading in digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. The Conversation Africa asked Iwa Salami, a researcher in regulatory frameworks for crypto-assets, to explain how best Nigeria can manage cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencyis a digital representation of a value or of a right. It can be transferred and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology. This is technology that allows multiple parties to share and update a common ledger (record) without relying on a central authority. Records of transactions are called blocks and they make up a blockchain. The origin of cryptocurrency can be traced to 1989 whenDigiCash, a company in the Netherlands, launched a digital currency called “eCash”. Although eCash didn’t survive, it influenced blockchain developments. The first and the best known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was launched in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonymSatoshi Nakamoto. Another is Ether, used on theEthereum network. All other cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin are calledAltcoinsand each has unique features. Cryptocurrencies exist outside the control of governments and central authorities. In theory, they are immune to government interference or manipulation. Cryptography ensures secure online payments without intermediaries. Although intangible, cryptocurrencies hold value based on market demand and adoption. The rise of cryptocurrencies can be attributed to: ease of access (compared with cash, foreign currency and traditional financial services through a bank) weak currencies (owing to economic stagnation, debt and political instability) easy and quick mechanisms to transfer funds privacy in transactions. Nigeria’s approach to regulating crypto-asset transactions has been unclear and inconsistent. In February 2021 the Central Bankbarredfinancial institutions from these transactions. But in May 2022, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission – the capital markets regulator –publisheda framework for their regulation. This was a sign that it approved of cryptocurrency trading. Then itbacktrackedin November 2022. In May 2024, the Central Bankbannedperson-to-person cryptocurrency trading in the naira. Read more:Cryptocurrencies are gaining ground across Africa. That's both good news and bad Nigeria needs a balanced approach to regulation if the industry is to thrive  without harming financial and monetary stability. Astable financial systemis capable of allocating resources efficiently and  managing financial risks. The approach must protect consumers and investors. If Nigerians were prevented from trading the naira on cryptocurrency exchanges, they might turn to other assets denominated in US dollars. That would be worse for the naira. Cryptocurrencies havehad a long historyof being used in illegal activities like money laundering and the drug trade. But they have not been linked with the devaluation of national currencies, as the Nigerian government hasalleged. The first step would be to register whoever is dealing in digital instruments. One of the key concerns raised by Nigerian authorities can be dealt with by tracking the identities and activities of users of crypto-exchanges. The regulatory framework passed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2022 provides for this. It requires all regulated exchanges to comply withKnow-Your-Customer requirements. Regulators can ask exchanges to disclose the identities of cryptocurrency account (wallet) holders linked with suspicious activities. Blockchain analytics firms likeChainalysisandEllipticwork closely with exchanges and can uncover sinister transactions. International standards also enable regulators to get information from foreign exchanges providing wallets to their citizens. So, in an ideal world, if regulators adopt international standards for crypto-asset activities these concerns should be addressed. For example, the Financial Stability Board hasrecommendedthat regulatory authorities share information on suspicious transactions on foreign cryptocurrency exchanges. If all regulators worldwide adopt international regulation, the outcomes would be consistent. This would address some of the key concerns raised by Nigerian regulators.

    "news_title": "Truth Social: why Donald Trump’s social media ‘meme stock’ surged and fell by over US$1 billion within a week",
    "news_content": "Director of the Centre for Digital Finance, Associate Professor in Finance, University of Southampton Larisa Yarovaya is affiliated with the British Blockchain Association.  University of Southamptonprovides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, went public on Tuesday March 26. Shares in parent company Trump Media & Technology Group surged 15% after its first day of trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange,adding US$1.1 billion(£876 million) to the company’s value. Trumpwrote“I LOVE TRUTH SOCIAL” on the platform, echoing the sentiment of “I just like the stock” from theGameStop share rallythat occurred in January 2021. For those who do not remember the GameStop case, shares in the Texan computer games retail chain experienced an unprecedented surge in prices following the activity of retail investors on the social media platform, Reddit. Millions of investors from Reddit’s WallStreetBets community pushed GameStop shares from US$20 to US$480 during theJanuary “short squeeze”, in which they drove some hedge funds into heavy losses after forcing them to liquidate massive bets against the stock. The power of small, amateur investors to outplay Wall Street giants was celebrated all over the internet, and even inspired the 2023 filmDumb Money. It appears that the Trump Media stock is yet another example of a so-called “meme stock”, whose popularity is driven by social media activities and memes posted on various platforms, such as Truth Social. However, while similarities with GameStop are apparent, the Trump Media movement looks unlikely to be as successful. On Monday April 1, less than a week after it began trading, shares of Trump Mediafellby more than 20%. The social media hype around GameStop originated from within a community of retail investors that took a “David v Goliath” mentality. The firm behind Truth Social has tried to cultivate a similar sentiment of “small guys” resisting Big Tech censorship. Devin Nunes, the CEO of Trump Media,stated: “As a public company, we will passionately pursue our vision to build a movement to reclaim the internet from big tech censors”. However, Trump Media stocks are directly linked to the exceptionally famous persona of Donald Trump, who owns58% of the shares. Thus, parallels could be drawn with PR campaigns that have been launched for crypto assets, such as NFTs (non-fungible tokens), where celebrities are often used to attract investors to the projects. Read more:From GameStop to crypto: how to protect yourself from meme stock mania The Trump media stock is undoubtedly appealing to his loyal supporters, who appear to have fuelled the surge in price. But meme stocks may attract a broader range of investors due to the social media hype. That is why it is important to understand that investing in any meme stock or “meme coin” is a risky endeavour. Surges in price that cannot be explained by any company fundamentals are called asset price bubbles. Speculative bubbles are quite common in financial and cryptocurrency markets and offer opportunities to generate abnormal returns in a short period of time. However, they can be risky for investors as they have a tendency to burst. Participating in such speculative behaviour is typically considered irrational since it is extremely hard tojustify the growthof the price. More importantly, it is nearly impossible to predict exactly when the bubble will burst. Retail investors should be cautious and definitely should not make decisions based solely on social media announcements regarding public figures. The share price of Trump Media has now dipped to almost pre-surge levels. For many retail investors, it is fair to assume that it is yet again too late to get abnormal returns on this surge. This is because the price of a meme stock tends to simply fluctuate after the initial surge. Trump Media stock plummets within a week of going public Only the long-term growth potential of an asset should be assessed to generate somewhat stable returns in the future. However, the long-term stock performance is rarely assessed when it comes to meme stocks, as investors in these stocks tend to have a very short investment horizon. Following the cryptocurrency market crash in 2022, many retail investorslost their savingsas the bubble burst. Many of the collapsed crypto assets were meme coins that had been promoted by celebrities.Dogecoin, for example, was promoted by Elon Musk. Celebrities have immense power to influence the public. But when it comes to financial decisions, the ethical implications of those campaigns are often not considered. At the time of writing, there is yet another bullish trend in cryptocurrency prices, particularly inBitcoin. Yet there is still no clarity in regulation or consumer protection, and there has been no regulatory response to concerns about the environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining. Some experts who invest in cryptocurrency and have direct financial benefit from surges in prices would, of course, argue that the rally is not a bubble and prices will keep growing. However, it might be unethical to expose consumers to unjustified risks. According to somestudies, awareness of thegreen critiquesassociated with cryptocurrency markets is growing. Butrecent researchthat I conducted with my colleagues shows that retail investors generally do not care. Understanding that crypto is “unsustainable” and “somewhat unethical” does not decrease the odds of investing in crypto assets among retail investors. The movement in Trump Media’s share price will have been backed by Trump supporters. But it will also have attracted some investors who simply wanted to partake in this share rally, even if they do not share Trump’s political views. The desire to make money quickly is one of the main driving factors of meme stock investments, and social media campaigns are great fuel for this sentiment. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",

Food crime not only harms our wallets but threatens public health. It includes activities such as mislabelling a product, replacing a food or ingredient with another substance that is inferior, and even poisoning. This is a global concern because of how food crime is evolving. The complexity of food supply chains, the globalisation of food markets, and a lack of transparency heightens the vulnerability of the food sector. So, rethinking how we combat food crime by using technology is imperative. Food crimes now inflict anestimated US$40 billion(£31 billion) in damages globally each year. The UK’s Food Standards Agencydefinesfood crime as “serious fraud and related criminality in food supply chains”. If we think about food crime from aprofit-driven criminal perspective, we can understand itsdual roleboth as a way for criminals to generate dirty money that needs to be laundered, and as a means of laundering illicit funds from other criminal activities. The food industry is particularly attractive to fraudsters because of its potential to be veryprofitable. Researchers have uncovered two main approaches adopted by fraudsters in relation tohigh-demand products. First, they target relatively low-cost everyday foods, such as bottled water or olive oil, because these involve a large proportion of consumers, which means they can maximise profits. For example, a Spanish and Italianinvestigation in 2023led to 260,000 litres of olive oil being seized. Investigators found that olive oil labelled as “virgin” or “extra virgin” had been diluted with a low-quality variant. Another example was the2013 horse meat scandal, when beef products across Europe were found to contain horse meat. Such meat was more thanfour times cheaperto produce. Alternatively, some fraudsters trick non-discerning “foodies” into paying premium prices for cheaper food dressed up as a superior product – for example,cheap truffles masqueradingas exotic Italian truffles. Unfortunately, our understanding of these complex financial crimes is often limited, making the detection and prevention of food fraud achallenging task. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, an international anti-fraud body, found that91% of organisationsglobally have used data analysis technology in response to growing financial crime risks. This technology holds promise because it canunearthhidden patterns in vast datasets, leading to better detection and prevention of crimes. Machine learning, for example, can analyse data and identify suspicious activity. It can also learn and adapt as new information becomes available. In the context of food crime, this could involve flagging particular locations, individuals or businesses that might pose a risk. Evidence is limited on this topic, so we think further research needs to be conducted to analyse past food fraud cases. Identifying recurring themes and patterns using machine learning could develop a better detection model which, when combined with the expertise of regulators, food producers, distributors and retailers, could be a powerful tool. The food industry is undergoing a potential shift, with researchers suggesting thatblockchain technologycould empower consumers to make better decisions when they buy food. Blockchain is like a secure public ledger that can’t be tampered with. So this technology offers the possibility of giving everyone from supermarket chains to individual consumers the ability to trace their food’s journey back to its origin, with ease and confidence. Imagine being able to make informed choices at the shop, knowing exactly where your food comes from. InAustralia, the implementation of blockchain technology by some producers in recent years is expected to help address the multi-billion dollar problem of food andwine fraud. Arecent studyfound blockchain’s data security and resistance to data corruption were important features that underlie its potential to combat food fraud. While new technology offers promise in fighting food crime, there arehurdlesto overcome. Implementing blockchain across the global food supply chain, for instance, faceschallengesincluding a lack of international standards and difficulty handling massive amounts of data. Blockchain technology may also require additional technology, making it expensive for small food producers. Ultimately, the key to tackling food fraud lies in collaboration. We need to bring together law enforcement, industry professionals, organisations of all sizes and academics, each with proper ethical oversight from their institutions. Any anti-fraud measures shouldn’t make it substantially harder for consumers to buy food. If the process becomes too cumbersome, people might find ways to circumvent it, which may create new vulnerabilities in the food system. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",

    "news_content": "Professor of Finance & Financial Technology, ICMA Centre, Henley Business School, University of Reading Andrew Urquhart owns some cryptocurrencies.  University of Readingprovides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Cryptocurrencies are surging again. Bitcoin has just hit an all-time high of more than US$72,000 (£56,300), pushing past the level of circa US$69,000 where it turned back during its last bull phase in late 2021. Other top cryptocurrencies like ethereum and solana have reached their highest prices in three years, on the back of a run that has been going since the autumn. The value of the whole cryptocurrency market has raced up to US$2.6 trillion, triple what it was worth at the beginning of 2023 and not far off its previous US$3 trillion peak. Much of this run has occurred at a time when the US dollar has been strengthening against other currencies (though it has fallen in the past couple of weeks). This can often be a time when cryptocurrencies get weaker, so it shows how strong they have been lately. Many other fiat currencies around the world have been losing value against the US dollar during this period, so bitcoin reachedall-time highsin many of them long before it finally took out its high in the US currency. So what has contributed to this explosion in prices and where is the market going for the rest of 2024? A major driver for this appreciation in prices has been theUS authorities’ approvalin January of an investment vehicle known as an exchange-traded fund or ETF for the general or “spot” bitcoin market. An ETF is an easy way for the average saver to get exposure to an asset, since they buy shares in the vehicle, usually through their financial advisor, rather than having to go to the trouble of buying the underlying asset. A total of 11 bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US, and their daily trading volume has nowexceeded US$10 billion– driven by frontrunnersBlackrock and Fidelity Investments. This demonstrates the large interest from traditional market participants, and as the spot ETFs become more mature, their providers will offer more promotional material and education to get more customers onboard. Bitcoin/US$ price The cryptocurrency market is always adapting and innovating, and one possible future innovation is the offer of option contracts on the new spot ETFs. Options allow traders to hedge their bets on whether the crypto market will go up or down, and would likely attract even more new money into the space. However, US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasjust postponeda decision on this innovation until late April. Someexperts thinkapproval may take longer than that as it is unclear which regulatory body would be responsible for policing this new class of derivative contracts. One featureof the bitcoin system which was built in at the beginning is that, roughly every four years, the rewards to companies using arrays of computers to create or “mine” bitcoin get cut in half. The last halvingtook placein May 2020, where miners went from receiving 12.5 bitcoin for each unit of work they do to 6.25 bitcoin. The next is due to take placeon April 19, cutting the reward down to 3.125 bitcoin. Because each halving means less new bitcoin coming on to the market, they havecoincided withstrong price appreciation in the cryptocurrency. What isn’t clear is whether this is already priced in and therefore not actually the reason price is going up. One theoryis that the institutions behind the spot ETFs are buying aggressively now because they know there will be less bitcoin on the open market once the halving takes place. Meanwhile, the crypto market could also be boosted by spot ETFs for the ethereum cryptocurrency system in the coming months. At least ten firms, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have applied to launch them and the SEC has until May to make a decision. Whereas the online ledger that underpins bitcoin, known as its blockchain, has been seen largely as a store of value, ethereum has become the leading blockchain for developers to write applications using this technology. SEC ChairGary Gensler believesthat most cryptocurrencies should be treated differently to bitcoin, as financial instruments known as securities rather than as more straightforward commodities. This adds complexity to the ethereum ETF approval process. If the US authorities were to decide it was the case,it would meanthat ETFs couldn’t buy ethereum from crypto exchanges until those exchanges had received approval to trade it as a security. While that uncertainty continues, ethereum could be boosted by the so-calledDencun upgrade(also known as Duncan or EIP-4844). Ethereum has competition from other blockchains such as solana and avalanche due to its relatively slow transaction speed and high costs. It already completed its first major step in a long-term plan to reduce costs and cope with many more users (known as scalability) when it transitioned in 2023 to a different system for verifying transactions known asproof of stake. The Dencun upgrade, which goes live on March 13, will further improve scalability by making data storage more efficient on the network, while also lowering transaction fees. Predicting cryptocurrency prices is not for the faint-hearted. The market is very volatile, and often exceeds expectations when it goes up or down. The behaviour of individuals determines market prices and, asIsaac Newton put it, you can “calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the people”. However, themajority of commentatorsexpect crypto prices to keep rising over the coming months.Election years tendto be good for investments in general, while asecond Trump administrationwould probably create amore favourableregulatory environment for crypto assets (as would aRishi Sunak victoryin the UK, however unlikely that seems at present). As bitcoin becomes more and more mainstream and integrated with traditional assets, it isn’t inconceivable that it could hit US$100,000 in 2024 – an extraordinary feat for a invention that was worth nothing as recently as 2009.

    "news_title": "Nigeria: botched economic reforms plunge the country into crisis",
    "news_content": "Assistant Professor of Economics, O.P. Jindal Global University Professor and Director, World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER), United Nations University Kunal Sen has received funding from ESRC and DFID.

United Nations Universityprovides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, is facing an economic crisis. From a botched currency redesign to the removal of fuel subsidies and a currency float, the nation has been plunged into spiralling inflation and a currency crisis with far-reaching consequences. The question now is: how long before the inferno consumes everything? On October 26, 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria announced abold move– that it had redesigned the country’s highest denomination notes (₦200, ₦500 and ₦1000) and would be removing all old notes from circulation. People were given a deadline of January 31, 2023 (a couple of weeks before a national election) to make this exchange, or all of the old notes would cease to be valid legal tender. This initiative ostensibly aimed to curb counterfeiting, encourage cashless transactions, and limit the buying of votes during the elections. But, while the intention may have been sound, the execution proved disastrous. Short deadlines, limited availability of new notes, and inadequate communication created widespread panic. It led to long queues at banks, frustration among citizens, and athriving black marketfor the new notes. The confusion surrounding the currency redesign had an unintended consequence: the beginnings of a loss of confidence in the naira. People began to look to other mediums as a store of value and as a medium of exchange. The obvious choices were foreign currency like the US dollar and the British pound, as well as more stable cryptocurrencies likeTether’s USDT. The currency redesign was criticised at the time by the then-presidential candidate of the ruling party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who saw it as a move toderail his presidential campaign. However, Tinubu won the contested election and, once in power, set out to reshape the economy immediately. In his inaugural address in May 2023, Tinubuannouncedthat the “fuel subsidy is gone”, referring to the government’s longstanding subsidised petrol policy that ensured Nigerians enjoyed some of the lowest petrol prices in the world. Over the coming days, he would also announce the reversal of the currency redesign policy and thefloating of the Nigerian nairaon the foreign exchange market. Other underlying economic conditions around the time of Tinubu’s inauguration included a large amount of foreign debt, dwindling foreign reserves and global economic headwinds. When the removal of the fuel subsidy was announced, it was met with a mix of surprise and elation by many Nigerians, and in particular by international donor agencies like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, who had long beenadvocatingfor the removal. But this was all before the effects began to bite. And bite hard they did. The price of Premium Motor Spirit (also known as gasoline or petrol), which used to retail for ₦189 (US$0.12) per litre, increased by 196% practically overnight and began to retail for₦557 per litre. One challenge with developing economies like Nigeria is that a rise in fuel price tends to cause the price of everything else to rise. Many industries, particularly those in manufacturing and agriculture, tend to rely heavily on fuel for powering machinery and equipment due to the poor supply of grid electricity nationwide. Many Nigerian households were significantly affected by the increased prices. But they saw an opportunity in that the savings from the fuel subsidy regime would be redistributed to improve education, healthcare provision and the general welfare of the people, as was promised during the electioneering. The regime cost the country an estimated₦400 billiona month at its height, after all. Then, on June 14, 2023, the Tinubu government ended the policy of pegging the naira to the US dollar, allowing it to float and find its true market value based on supply and demand. The idea was to stop corruption and reduce arbitrage opportunities due to the difference between official and black-market foreign exchange prices. Currency arbitrage happens when people buy a currency at the lower official exchange rate and immediately sell it at the higher black market rate for a profit. This practice often occurs where there are strict currency controls and black markets offer a truer reflection of a currency’s value based on supply and demand. However, this was one policy change too many. The naira lost a staggering25% of its valuein one day, and the cascading effects now push the country to the brink. Nigeria depends heavily on imported commodities, including essential goods like food, fuel and medicine. So the policy escalated the inflationary crisis, pushing inflation to almost 30% (the major driver being food inflation, whichreached 35.4%). Imports in general have become significantly more expensive, and Nigerians are finding their purchasing power being eroded. Wages in Nigeria are pretty fixed. The current minimum wage in the country is₦30,000per month and the average monthly income is₦71,185. Businesses are also feeling the pinch, facing difficulties accessing theforeign exchangecritical for importing raw materials and equipment. The Central Bank of Nigeria has implemented measures to counter the crisis. It recently raised interest rates from18.75% to 22.75%and is selling US dollars through auctions. Recovery is a possibility and there are already signs of appreciation in the currency. Thenaira appreciatedby 6.89% a day after interest rates were raised. But it will be a long, hard road. These strategies often come with trade-offs. Higher interest rates can stifle already struggling economic growth, while currency interventions might deplete already strained reserves of foreign currency. The bottom line is that if the current cost of living crisis continues, civil unrest is likely. Should this happen, who knows what – if anything – will be left behind when the flames are done.

Cardiff Universityprovides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. University of Readingprovides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners The year 2023 will be remembered as turbulent for cryptocurrencies, with numerous important developments that ultimately helped to “clean up” the space to potentially make it more attractive to mainstream investors. Notably there wasthe convictionof FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for fraud. Top exchange Binance also reached aUS$4 billion settlement(£3.1 billion) with the US treasury department over money-laundering charges, which saw CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao agreeing tostep downand pay a US$50 million fine. Meanwhile, regulators continuedcracking downon other operators, but potentially lost one of their key cases against the industry after aUS court ruledthat the XRP token, one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, was not a security (meaning a tradeable financial asset like shares or bonds). This means its creator, Ripple, did not break the law by selling it on exchanges. Viewed as a test case for the majority of cryptocurrencies, the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) iscurrently appealing. While all this was happening, the bitcoin price rose away from the lows of late 2022. It started the year at US$16,000 and ended comfortably above the US$40,000 threshold. So what does 2024 look like for this sector and what key events are on the horizon? The SEC may finally be about to greenlight a type of investment vehicle known as an exchange traded fund (ETF) for the general or “spot” bitcoin market. ETFs already exist for everything from oil to the FTSE 100 to even regions and countries. They track the underlying asset, creating an easy way for people to invest without having to buy the asset directly. Until now, the only ETFs permitted for crypto in the US have been for thefutures markets. These niche markets are concerned with where investors think crypto prices are heading in future. Bitcoin price 2021-24 A spot bitcoin ETF would likely encourage mainstream investors to buy exposure to this market, while potentially attracting banks to actively participate too. Bitcoin could be offered by financial advisors and there would no longer be a need for investors to hold the asset itself orface difficultieslike crypto exchanges, coin storage and so on. There are various reasons why many commentators think the SEC may now end its opposition to such an ETF. For one thing, the list of applicantsincludes Blackrock, the biggest investment house in the world, along with various othermajor players. Also, digital asset group Grayscale won an important case against the SEC in 2023, which had been blocking its attempt to convert its US$17 billion bitcoin futures ETF, GBTC, into a spot version. This has forced the SEC to reconsider Grayscale’s application too. Further, Hong Kong’s regulatory authority has announced it is open to spot bitcoin ETF applications and haslaid down guidelinespermitting several varieties. As well as the basic model that we may soon see in the US, where investors would buy into bitcoin ETFs with dollars, Hong Kong is open to a second variety known as “in-kind”. This would make it possible to convert shares in a bitcoin ETF into bitcoin and vice versa, allowing more flexibility and potentially attracting more institutional investors into the space. Jerome Powell, chair of US central bank the Federal Reserve,has indicatedthat interest rates may have peaked, and that the Fed is likely to cut them during 2024. Similarly in the UK, leading mortgage lender Halifax has cut itslending ratein expectation of a Bank of England rate cut. If interest rates are cut or even stabilise in 2024, it could make bitcoin (and other digital assets) more attractive to investors, since itslimited supplymakes it a hedge against traditional currencieslosing valueover time. More generally, rate cuts prompt investors to look for higher investment returns, and cryptocurrencies have delivered here too. Asset class returns since 2011 In addition, the US and other economies may entera recessionin the later half of 2024 due to the lagged effects of the interest rate hikes. Equally, we saw a number ofbank failuresin 2023, predominantly in the US. In the event of a recession or more bank problems, governments may be forced to provide stimulus packages and print more money. This would further devalue currencies and make bitcoin still more attractive. A big event for bitcoin in 2024 is the so-called “halving”. Bitcoin runs on an online ledger known as a blockchain, in which entries are validated by “miners” using arrays of computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles. Miners are paid in bitcoin for completing a set of transactions known as a block, and the protocol stipulates that theirreward per blockhalves every 210,000 “blocks” (roughly every four years). The reward began at 50 bitcoin in 2009 and isexpected to fallfrom 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin around the middle of April 2024. This decrease entails fewer bitcoin sold on the market, which tightens supply and may squeeze out the least efficient miners, significantly reducing the computer power used by the network. The three previous halvings have prompted dramatic bull runs, while also driving up the prices of digital assets more generally as investors take more risks in the space. Halving effects The bitcoin network saw a number of technological advancements in 2023. This has included enabling a new anda uniqueform of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) known as ordinals, and also a new standard called BRC-20 that makes it possible to create new cryptocurrencies on the network. Until now, NFTs and new cryptocurrencies have mostly been issued on other blockchains such as ethereum. We are also seeinggrowing adoptionof the Lightning network, a layer above the bitcoin blockchain that enables much faster transactions. All these changes are resulting inincreased demandfor bitcoin, which in turn may lead to higher prices. In sum, there’s a strong case for being bullish about bitcoin’s price in the year ahead.Commentators’ predictionsrange from US$60,000 to US$500,000 by year end. Our own belief is that though the road may be bumpy, 2024 could well see increased adoption of cryptocurrencies, which will drive prices beyond the current US$40,000 mark.

    "news_title": "AI makes Silicon Valley’s philosophy of ‘move fast and break things’ untenable",
    "news_content": "Assistant Professor of Sociotechnical Systems, Department of Psychology, National University of Ireland Maynooth Professor of Psychology in the School of Psychology, Dublin City University The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.  Dublin City Universityprovides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners The unofficial motto of Silicon Valley has long been“move fast and break things”. It relies on the assumption that in order to create cutting edge technology and to be ahead of the competition, companies need to accept that things will get damaged in the process. However, this approach can have implications beyond just economics. It can endanger people and be unethical. As we mark the first anniversary of the release of AI chatbot ChatGPT, it’s worth considering whether the big tech companies could do with moving slowly and taking care not to break anything. ChatGPT’simpressive capabilities caused a sensation. But some commentators were quick to point to issues such as the potential it presented forstudents to cheat on assignments. More widely, the chatbot intensified a debate over how to control AI, a transformative technology with huge potential benefits – and risks of comparable significance. Let’s look at Silicon Valley’s record on other technology too. Social media was supposed to bring us together. Instead, it hasthreatened democracyand produced armies of trolls. Cryptocurrencies, touted as challenging the financial status quo have been anenvironmental disasterand have beenvulnerable to fraud. The advent of the personal computer was supposed to make our work life easier. It did, but at the price of massive job losses which the job market tookmore than a decade to recover from. It’s not that technologies in themselves are bad. However, the ideology within which they are developed can be a problem. And as technology permeates more and more of our daily lives, the “things” that break could potentially end up being human lives. “Move fast and break things” could also prove to be economically wrong, making investors rush for novelty instead of value, as they did in the dot com bubble of the early 2000s. The idea assumes that although things might go wrong, we will be able to fix them quickly, and so the harms will be limited. Yet, looking at the history of Silicon Valley, this has been shown to be a problem on several counts. Identifying that there is a problem is not the same as finding its cause. Once a technology has been deployed, the environment in which it is used may be so complex that it takes years to understand what exactly is going wrong. The US justice system, for instance, has been using AI for more than a decade to assist bail decisions. These decide who should be released prior to trial against a cash bond. AI was introduced not just as a way to reduce the flight risk, of defendants going on the run, but also to tackle racial bias, where white judges might be more likely to release white defendants. However, the algorithmsproduced the opposite result, with fewer black defendants being released. Engineers kept on introducing new versions of the AI algorithms, hoping to reduce bias. Nothing worked. Then, in 2019 – 17 years after the system was first introduced – a researcher found that the problem was not the AI itself, but theway judges were using it. They were more likely to overrule decisions that didn’t fit with their stereotypes, and the problem was the interaction between the judges and the AI. Independently, each could take somewhat appropriate decisions. Together, it was a disaster. Another reason why Silicon Valley’s approach is risky is that the consequences of new technologies can take a long time to appear. This means that by the time we realise the harm done, it is already too late. The Dutch welfare system, for instance, has relied heavily on AI algorithms to detect fraud. It has beenproblematic in many regards, but in particular, it was found to use ethnic origin and nationality as an important risk factor. It took years for the full-blown issue to become apparent. And by that time, some people had been so heavily affected by the AI assisted decisions –- asking them to return hundreds of thousands of euros for a simple mistake on a form -– thatsome took their own lives. To “move fast and break things” also means that someone else, somewhere, will be left to clean up the mess. For those who produce the technology, it’s a way of abrogating responsibility for its outcomes, whether the companies realise it or not. Social media is a damning example of this. Social media’s “suggestion” algorithms – also powered by AI – have created a host of issues, frompromoting misinformation and hate speechjust because those thingscreates more engagement, to facilitating harassment and negativelyaffecting mental health. Yet we still struggle to curb these issues, with social media platforms refusing to take responsibility for the content they promote and benefit from. The first anniversary of ChatGPT provides us with an opportunity to look back on what lessons can be learned from previous technological advances. It helps us realise that mistakes are easier to avoid than to fix, especially where human lives are involved. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",

Mississippi State Universityprovides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners The case of Sam Bankman-Fried, whowas sentenced on March 28, 2024, to 25 years in prison, is emblematic of the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, in which vast sums of money can be made or lost in the blink of an eye. In early November 2022, the crypto exchange FTX was valued at more than US$30 billion. By the middle of that month,FTX was in bankruptcy proceedings. And less than a year later, on Nov. 3, 2023, its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found guilty ofseven counts of money laundering and fraud, following a trial that featured less than a month oftestimonyand only about four hours of jury deliberation. D. Brian BlankandBrandy Hadleyare professors who study finance,executives,corporate governanceand financial technology. They explain how and why this incredible collapse happened, what effect it might have on the traditional financial sector and whether you should care. A million years ago, back in2019, Bankman-Fried founded FTX, a company that ran one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. FTX was where many crypto investors traded and held their cryptocurrency, similar to the New York Stock Exchange for stocks. Bankman-Fried also foundedAlameda Research, a hedge fund that invested in cryptocurrencies and crypto companies. In the traditional financial sector, these two companies would be entirely separate firms, or at least have firewalls in place to avoid conflicts of interest. But in early November 2022, news outlets reported that asignificant proportion of Alameda’s assetswere a type of cryptocurrency released by FTX itself. A few days later, news broke that FTX had allegedly been loaning customer assets to Alameda for risky tradeswithout customers’ consentand also issuing its own FTX cryptocurrency for Alameda to use ascollateral. As a result, criminal and regulatory investigators began scrutinizing FTX for potentiallyviolating securities law. These two pieces of news basically led to a bank run on FTX, and soon afterward, FTX, Alameda Research and 130 other affiliated companies founded by Bankman-Fried filed for bankruptcy. This lefthuge numbersof investors who bought cryptocurrencies through the exchange withno good way to get their money back. Within a month, Bankman-Fried wasarrestedandcharged with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money launderingby the Southern District of New York. In February 2023,additional criminal chargesrelated to political donations were announced, followed byanother indictmentin March related to bribery. Bankman-Fried’sfirst trial began on Oct. 3, 2023, and largely focused on the “essentially unlimited” access to capital Alameda had on the exchange through a secret line of credit. In traditional markets, corporations generallylimit the risk they expose themselves toby maintaining liquidity and solvency. Liquidity is the ability of a firm to sell assets quickly without those assets losing much value. Solvency is the idea that a company’s assets are worth more than what that company owes todebtors and customers. But the crypto world has generally operated with much less caution than the traditional financial sector, andFTX is no exception. Abouttwo-thirdsof the money that FTX owed to the people who held cryptocurrency on its exchange – roughly $11.3 billion of $16 billion owed – was backed by illiquid coins created by FTX. FTX was taking its customers’ money, giving it to Alameda to make risky investments and then creating its own currency, known as FTT, as a replacement – cryptocurrency that it was unable to sell at a high enough price when it needed to. In addition, nearly 40% of Alameda’s assets were in FTX’s own cryptocurrency – and remember, both companies were founded by the same person. This all came to a head when investors decided to sell their coins on the exchange. FTX did not have enoughliquidassets to meet those demands. This in turn drove the value of FTT from over $26 a coin at the beginning of November 2022 to under $2 by Nov. 13. By this point, FTX owed more money to its customers thanit was worth. In regulated exchanges, investing with customer funds isillegal. Additionally, auditors validate financial statements, and firms must publish the amount of money they hold in reserve that is available to fund customer withdrawals. And even if things go wrong, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation – or SIPC – protects depositors against the loss of investments from an exchange failure or financially troubled brokerage firm. The crypto world lacks such guardrails. While the collapse of FTX and Alameda – valued at more than $30 billion and now essentially worth nothing – was dramatic, the bigger implication is simply the potentiallost trust in crypto. Bank runs are rare in traditional financial institutions, but they areincreasingly commonin the crypto space. Given that Bankman-Fried and FTX were seen as some of the biggest, most trusted figures in crypto, these events may lead more investors to think twice about putting money in crypto. Though investment in cryptocurrencies has grown rapidly, the entire crypto market –valued at over $3 trillionat its peak –is much smallerthan the $120 trilliontraditional stock market. While investors and regulators are still evaluating the consequences of this fall, the impact on any person who doesn’t personally own crypto will be minuscule. It is true that many larger investment funds, such as\nBlackRock and the Ontario Teachers Pension, held investments in FTX, but the estimated$95 million the Ontario Teachers Pension lostthrough the collapse of FTX is just 0.05% of the entire fund’s investments. The takeaway for most individuals is not to investin unregulated marketswithout understanding the risks. In high-risk environments like crypto, it’s possible to lose everything – a lesson investors in FTX learned the hard way. The trial of Bankman-Fried brought attention to the ever-evolving and complex nature of cryptocurrency regulation and oversight. At the conclusion of the case,Damian Williams, the federal prosecutor for the U.S. Justice Department, underlined thedepartment’s dedication to fighting fraud,even in the relatively new crypto space. This case shows that the U.S. is willing to assert broad jurisdiction over financial crimes targeting its citizens, regardless of where the perpetrating company is based, which in FTX’s case wasthe Bahamas. Notably, this trial did not fall directly under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory bodies, although pending civil cases from boththe SECand theCommodity Futures Trading Commission,along with ongoingclass-action lawsuits, underscore thecomplexities in regulating the cryptocurrency sphere. Despite a recent crypto crackdown by the SEC, the U.S. continues to lag behind other nations in establishing comprehensive crypto regulations. This is evident in theformal regulatory frameworks introduced by places such as the U.K.and the European Union. The International Monetary Fund’scall for comprehensive regulationsfurther underscores the necessity for more robust regulatory measures within the crypto industry, hinting at a widening gap between the U.S. and much of the rest of the world.

    "news_title": "Sam Bankman-Fried convicted for massive FTX fraud, in stark reminder of risks of crypto trading",
    "news_content": "Senior Lecturer, Canberra School of Politics, Economics and Society, University of Canberra John Hawkins does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.  University of Canberraprovides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners It is not just crypto tokens that have spectacular downfalls. So can crypto personalities. Sam Bankman-Fried founded FTX, one of the world’s largest exchanges for so-called cryptocurrencies, which collapsed last year owing billions of dollars. Now he has gone from being hailed as potentially theworld’s first trillionaireto a lengthy term in prison. After a month-long trial, a New York jury took less than five hours tofind him guiltyon seven counts of fraud and money laundering. Bankman-Fried’s conviction highlights the risks of crypto markets, where people trade tokens with no fundamental value via hugely complex and poorly regulated financial machinery. The Australian government is currently considering how to protect consumers in such markets. Treasury has commenced aconsultation process. But it will not be an easy task when so much of the activity occurs overseas or in cyberspace. Bankman-Fried chose to testify in his own defence. But he failed to convince the jury he was merely amaths nerdwith a poor memory who was unaware of what his friends and colleagues were doing with the companies in which he was the largest stakeholder. In FTX’s final days, as concerned customers started withdrawing their deposits, Bankman-Fried tweeted “FTX is fine. Assets are fine”. It appears the jury did not accept he truly believed this at the time. The verdict is a salutary warning about the dangers of unregulated financial markets such as crypto. As the former chair of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority put it, fraud is “a feature, not a bug” for much of the industry. Crypto tokens such as Bitcoin have no underlying assets to give them some fundamental value. They only generate a return if the owner can sell at a higher price, to someone who expects the price to go even higher. This makes them one of the purest examples of a speculative bubble. Read more:Almost no one uses Bitcoin as currency, new data proves. It's actually more like gambling One of the ironies of the crypto market is that cryptocurrency is sold as a way to avoid having to trust governments or banks, as one does with traditional currency. But in practice, crypto trading often relies on trusting individuals – some of them charlatans such as Bankman-Fried. Punters thought they could trust FTX to mind their funds for them while they switched between speculative crypto tokens such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin. They were not investing in FTX, or even lending their money to it. Read more:The spectacular collapse of a $30 billion crypto exchange should come as no surprise But instead of letting customers’ funds sit around waiting to be withdrawn, FTX transferred a lot of them to another company, Alameda Research. This was an investment fund, poorly run by Bankman-Fried and his cronies. It is still not clear what happened to all the missing billions. Some of the money was frittered away on extravagant living. Some went to pay celebrities for advertisements and endorsements, such as the famous Super Bowl clip starring comedian Larry David. At least David can say he was warning people against “getting into crypto”. Some of the missing cash went on large political donations. Much was lost on poor bets by Alameda which failed to hedge against the risk that the price of crypto tokens could quickly plummet. FTX was essentially a casino. But Bankman-Fried both owned the casino and was gambling in it – and gambling with other people’s chips. Bankman-Fried is stillproclaiming his innocence. But he looks likely to be in prison for decades. He will find out how long on March 28 2024. Itcould be more than a centuryif he receives the maximum penalty on all the counts on which he has been convicted. And he may yet face further charges.

    "news_content": "Peter Howson is a Researcher in International Development at Northumbria, where he leads the MSc in International Development. I'm interested in the innovation agendas of conservation and international development organisations. And how innovation is often used as camouflage for pinching stuff from poor people. I also consider how these same technologies are deployed to enable more equitable post-capitalist futures. My current projects include analysis of the ‘blue belt’ network of marine protection measures in the UK Overseas Territories. I'm also looking at how cryptocurrencies and carbon trading are coming together to make trees more valuable standing than cut down.. Before joining Northumbria, Pete was a Lecturer in International Development at Nottingham Trent University. In 2016 he was a Post-doc Researcher at Colorado State University, looking at Palau’s National Marine Sanctuary. Before that, he was based at University of Wellington, Aotearoa, New Zealand. My PhD research explored the political ecology of climate finance in Indonesia. Copyright © 2010–2024,The Conversation",
