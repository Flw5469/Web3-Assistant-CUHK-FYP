    "news_title": "Cardano (ADA) NVT Ratio Now Highest Since June: What Does It Mean?",
    "news_content": "On-chain data shows that Cardano’s Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio has surged recently. Here’s what this could imply for ADA’s price. In a newposton X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock discusses the latest trend in Cardano’s NVT Ratio. The “NVT Ratio” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the ADA market cap andtransaction volume. When the value of this metric is high, it means the value of the network is high compared to its ability to transact coins. Generally, this can signal that the coin’s price is overvalued. On the other hand, the low indicator implies the market cap may be undervalued compared to the blockchain’s volume, so ADA’s price could be due to a rebound. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Cardano NVT Ratio over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Cardano NVT Ratio has witnessed a notable surge recently, even though the coin’s price has been following an overall bearish trajectory. This would suggest that the transaction volume has tanked on the network. Following this latest increase, the indicator has spiked to the highest level since June, implying that the cryptocurrency hasn’t been this overvalued in six months. The reason behind this trend is likely to be the lackluster price action the coin has witnessed for a while now. Other assets, such as Bitcoin, have started topop offrecently. At the same time, ADA has remained a sideways movement, so ADA investors may be fed up and leave to explore greener pastures. “Historically, elevated NVT ratios often precede price pullbacks,” notes the analytics firm. Thus, the recent spike in the indicator could spell further trouble for the already struggling coin. The Cardano NVT Ratio could now be to keep an eye on in the coming days, as any more jumps in the metric may confirm a bearish outcome. However, there is also the possibility that the trend will see a reversal, with enough activity returning on the network to justify its current market cap. The cryptocurrency sector as a whole has been rising during the past day, and Cardano has followed suit. Although the coin’s surge has been smaller than Bitcoin’s, the asset has climbed above the $0.348 level. The chart below shows the coin’s recent trajectory.

Keshav is currently a senior writer at NewsBTC and has been attached to the website since June 14, 2021. Keshav has been writing for many years, first as a hobbyist and later as a freelancer. He has experience working in a variety of niches, even fiction at one point, but the cryptocurrency industry has been the longest he has been attached to. In terms of official educational qualifications, Keshav holds a bachelor’s degree in Physics from one of the premier institutes of India, the University of Delhi (DU). He started the degree with an aim of eventually making a career in Physics, but the onset of COVID led to a shift in plans. The virus meant that the college classes had to be delivered in the online-mode and with it came free time for him to explore other passions. Initially only seeking to make some beer money, Keshav unexpectedly landed clients offering real projects, after which there was no looking back. Writing was something he had always enjoyed and to be able to do it for a living was like a dream come true. Keshav completed his Physics degree in 2022 and has been focusing on his writing career since, but that doesn’t mean his passion for Physics has ended. He eventually plans to re-enter university to obtain a masters degree in the same field, but perhaps only to satiate his own interest rather than for using it as a means to find employment.. Keshav has found blockchain and its concepts fascinating ever since he started going down the rabbit-hole back in 2020. On-chain analysis in particular has been something he likes to research more about, which is why his NewsBTC pieces tend to involve it in some form. Being of the science background, Keshav likes if concepts are clear and consistent, so he generally explains the indicators he talks about in a bit of detail so that the readers can perhaps come out having understood and learnt something new. As for hobbies, Keshav is super into football, anime, and videogames. He enjoys football not only as a watcher, but also as a player. For games, Keshav generally tends towards enjoying singleplayer adventures, with EA FC (formerly FIFA) being the only online game he is active in. Though, perhaps due to being ultra-focused on the game, he is today a semi-pro on the EA FC scene, regularly participating in tournaments and sometimes even taking back prize money. Because of his enthusiasm for anime and games, he also self-learned Japanese along the way to consume some of the untranslated gems out there. The skill didn’t merely remain as just a hobby, either, as he put it to productive use during his exploration for small-time gigs at the start of COVID, fulfilling a couple of Japanese-to-English translation jobs. Keshav is also big into fitness, with agility and acceleration-related workouts making a big part of his program due to the relevance they have in football. On top of that, he also has a more traditional strength based program for the gym, which he does to maintain an overall fitness level of his body.
