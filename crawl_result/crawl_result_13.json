There may be a delay between a video being published on the site and the availability of its transcript and close captions while we create the transcript. If a video is not in English, there will be subtitles in English over the video but no transcript. Some of our videos do not have speech in them, so will never have a transcript.

    "news_title": "The life and tastes of Anthony Scaramucci ",
    "news_content": " Interview byTim Auld. Photography by Jeremy Liebman The stories that matter on money and politics in the race for the White House My personal style signifieris a custom-made diamond, ruby and sapphire stars-and-stripes-flag lapel pin. My wife gave it to me and it’s like a representation of our reconciliation, because we nearly got divorced during the Trump thing [when he was White House communications director for 10 days in 2017]. Women like it and men tease me about it. If women like something and men are breaking your balls over it then you know you’re doing something right. There’s also my blue suits. I wear Armani, Loro Piana and Zegna. When you’re short and stocky — which is code for Italian — you need to wear an Italian cut. The last thing I bought and lovedwas my 2022 Lamborghini Huracán. When you’re an Italian kid growing up with no money, your dad’s a crane operator and you are thinking about making it through a few classes up to the American dream — if you’re Guido from Long Island — you want an Italian sports car. When I bought that car I was closing in on 60 and it was one of my life’s dreams. The best book I’ve read in the past year,if we’re talking about fiction, isLessons in Chemistryby Bonnie Garmus, about a woman chemist working in a research laboratory in the 1950s and ’60s. It’s about sexism, misogyny and the things that happened in theMad Menera of America. It’s a rite-of-passage book that asks, “How do we seek our true self?” I’m a big-time book nerd. I’d also recommendApril 1865: The Month that Saved Americaby Jay Winik. It’s about the month when Lincoln was assassinated but it’s incredibly timely. I would imagine that 50 years from now somebody could write a similar book about November 2024. To me,1865is a book about 2024. Do we have the right calibre of leadership to help the country reunite itself? Don’t go to the Rudy Giuliani school of hair dye. You can’t do it yourself The most interesting thing I learned from working for Donald Trumpwas that you can like or dislike him but he has exceptional political instincts. Pay attention to the little people. I grew up in a blue-collar family, but what I did is I went to Tufts and Harvard Law School and Goldman Sachs and the salons of the hedge funds and Davos and all these elite places, and I started to get the confirmed biases of the people I was hanging out with. What Trump taught me was that we’d turned a very large quadrant of the country to desperation, all working class. And he taught me something that I will keep with me for the rest of my life. Pay attention to everybody. Don’t just pay attention to the people you are hanging out with. Because whether you like it or not, we’re all connected. Kamala Harris’s number one qualityis that she knows how to build a team. She was wholly underestimated. She hadn’t been in the spotlight. The hard right was denigrating her and making you feel like she’s vacuous, but she’s not. People of colour, and women, have to be three times smarter to get into these roles. She’s reached out to people like me where she’s opening the tent. If you want a cute joke: Bernie Sanders, Anthony Scaramucci and Dick Cheney walk into a bar… I don’t have the punchline yet, but you get the point. She’s building this very broad coalition. We don’t want to go back to 1947, before we had African-Americans in professional baseball leagues. We want to go to 2047, where we’re more unified and less tribal. A way to make me laughis to make fun of me. WhenSaturday Night Livecalled me human cocaine I thought that was really funny. I don’t think anybody eviscerated me more when I was in the White House for that short stint than Bill Maher, so the first place I wanted to show up afterwards was on his show. Trump can’t laugh about anything because his self-awareness is too brittle. My style iconisTom Ford. Unfortunately, you’d have to divide my waist in four to fit into a Tom Ford suit. I think the only things that fit me are his sunglasses… and his cologne. I’m not saying Ralph Lauren and all those other people aren’t great, but Tom Ford has intersected modernism and traditionalism better than anybody else in the style community. I have a collection ofvintage comic books that goes back to the 1940s. I am a DC Universe person. In my study I have a rendering that I commissioned from the comic-book artistMike Grellof the cover of my favourite comic book from the 1970s, which shows Superman boxing Muhammad Ali. I knew Ali and have a good relationship with his widow; he was a truth-teller and a champion. I had it personalised, so I’m in the front row of the audience alongside a host of icons: Batman, Telly Savalas, Burt Reynolds, Lucille Ball, Jack Kennedy with Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, Johnny Carson, Dean Martin. On the bookshelves behind my desk you’ll findfigurines. When I bought Bitcoin for the first time, I got it wrong. It went from $60,000 to $50,000, so theNew York Posthad a cartoon of me sinking in a Bitcoin boat. So these are the assholes that I work with: they had this bobblehead made of me sinking in that boat. My kids put up a model of Yoda. And there’s a bulldog like the one M gave 007 inSkyfalland Superman throwing a car. I found the secret to surviving in financein a book calledThe Richest Man in Babylonby George S Clason. I read it in my 20s and now give it out to kids. Everything you need to know about finance is in there. It says be patient. Save a little bit every day, pay yourself first. I don’t care what your salary is. There’s enough room in there for $10. There’s room in there for $20. And so from my early 20s to today, every single paycheque I have chipped off a piece and put it in the stock market. If you do that for 40 years, you develop wealth because the principle of compound investing is probably the most ingenious part of mathematics. If I can get a seven per cent return every 10 years, I’ll double my money. This book single-handedly made me independently wealthy, irrespective of my career. The best gift I’ve given recentlyis a Maserati for my mother’s 85th birthday. I’d previously bought her a Mercedes, but it was getting old. I said, “What do you want,” and she said laughingly: “A Maserati, but you don’t have to do that.” I bought it. And the best gifts I’ve receivedare sunglasses. I’m the Imelda Marcos of sunglasses. I have two eyeballs and 2,000 sunglasses. In my fridge you’ll always findMountain Valley spring water in glass bottles, White Moustache yoghurt, black cherries, fresh and frozen blueberries, and half-and-half milk for my coffee. I don’t have a clue about cooking. I’m an Italian mamma’s boy, OK? The thing I couldn’t do withoutis my pair ofNew Balance990 trainers. My children call them the Grandpa 9000s. I have to get a workout in: it makes me feel better about myself, clearer-headed. My grooming guru ismy dermatologist, Dr Joel Kassimir. Vain and pain rhyme for a reason and I’ve probably taken more Botox needles to my forehead than any 60-year-old I know. I got blessed with a good head of hair, so I want to make sure I keep it. You’ve got to go for PRP injections in the back of your head. Does it work? My brother’s bald. Do I look bald? I’m a vain SOB. I have a colour rinse every three weeks. But I get it professionally dyed. Don’t go to the Rudy Giuliani school of hair dye. You can’t do it yourself. I don’t know what she’s using, but I love Erika at theArsen Gurgovsalon; she’s probably the best colourist in Manhattan. What I learned from my neighbourhoodwas to live life without fear. Donald Trump’s going to attack my wife on X after I gave him $1mn and hundreds of hours of media advocacy. He’s got to be ready for the fight: I’ll bring it back to him. I’m supposed to be afraid of him? You got to live your life with no fear. What do you gotta lose? Relax. None of us is getting out of here alive. In another lifeI would have been in the entertainment industry. I didn’t have the balls, but I would have enjoyed it. The music I’m listening tois by Billy Joel. You can’t live on Long Island without loving Billy Joel. If you download “The Downeaster ‘Alexa’”, you’ll know everything you need to know about Long Island in four minutes. As Bruce Springsteen is to New Jersey, Billy Joel is to Long Island. I’m not looking foranother job in the White House. I just told Kamala and her staff that I want one more day there. I can cook and clean if I have to. I can wash dishes. Just one more day. I’m kidding. I don’t want to go back. I have had my fill. I got an education of a lifetime. I love my country, but I also like my family. I want to stay married and happy. The last items of clothing I added to my wardrobewereValentinoT-shirts. One of them has a white rose on it. Again, the Italian stuff fits me better. Working with Katty KayonThe Rest is Politics: USis like John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John doing a podcast, but in character. I’m driving her crazy with my poor manners and my New York Italian accent. When I need to feel inspired, I go to the gym or for a run. The other thing I do is write. I have notes all over the place. I think you manifest your life through your thoughts. I wrote a book,From Wall Street to the White House and Back, last year. I was inspired byMeditationsby Marcus Aurelius, one of my favourite books. It’s a lesson for people on not giving up on things. When I got my ass fired from the White House, my wife had filed for divorce, I missed the birth of our son… My wife and I have repaired our relationship, but it was a very bad time. The podcasts I’m listening toareThe Rest is Politics (UK);The Rest Is History;All-In, which is a business conversation, based in San Francisco — I like it because generally I don’t agree with them politically, but I think they’re very sharp on business; andThe New York Times’sEzra Klein Show: he’s incredibly smart on politics. The places that mean a lot to meare my home in the Hamptons near the beach and my small ski home in Windham in Greene County. But my number one place is Hawaii. I’m a big coffee drinker — I think some of the best coffee in the world is in Hawaii. An artist whose work I collectis the 3D artistCharles Fazzino. I have several pieces he’s made for me, which include all the fun things we like to do as a family, and the places we like to go. I first saw his work at a baseball stadium, because he does a lot of art for major league sports. The best way to spend $20is on an iced espresso, a Reese’s Fast Break King Size and a bag of salt and vinegar potato chips. Don’t eat them all at the same time, but that’s 20 bucks well spent for somebody who’s a junk-food eater like me. The most viewed websites on my phoneare Amazon and the Drudge Report. Amazon to buy things of convenience and the Drudge Report to see what it’s curating from a political perspective. But my favourite website/app isBlinkist: I’m a premium subscriber and it gives you a 15-minute summary of some bestselling and great books. I believe inlife after death because I got raised Catholic. Once you’re Catholic you’re always a Catholic, no matter what type of secular world you’re living in. My favourite room in my houseis the sitting room because it’s got sunlight and my wife has done a great job of decorating it. In truth, I’ve only actually been allowed to have my way with two rooms in the house and that’s my study and the gym. My favourite Italian dishis something with a tomato sauce, meatballs and grated Romano or pecorino cheese. I’m a southern Italian, so I grew up on peasant food. My favourite buildingis the Chrysler Building. Walter Chrysler was the Steve Jobs or Bill Gates of his time. He was a maverick. And, of course, it was built before the Empire State Building, so it was a real statement in the city. The most important thing I learned from my parentswas incredibly hard work — and paying your debts. One of the more vivid memories of my upbringing is picking up some shirts from the dry cleaners and my dad getting a parking ticket on Main Street in the town I grew up in. He put the shirts in the car, walked the parking ticket up to the Post Office and said, “I don’t even want to wait. I pay all my debts.” I tell my staff that I could never dishonour my dad. Trump lives in a team of one. He’s too narcissistic to share any credit What Trump is doingis really bad because his three-legged stool is misogyny, racism and anti-immigration, which, ironically, makes him the most un-American presidential candidate. As a country, we’re about knitting together multiple races, multiple ethnic backgrounds, openness to different people’s sexual orientations, to create a country that can see our common nature more than whatever separates us. But he’s hard on the separation. He’s hard on the fear-based division. He’s hard on tribalism. Which will pull America apart at a time when America has to figure out a way to come together. When we were kids my grandmother would say“the best among us choose not to judge human frailty so harshly”. Good leadership requires a love of people. And it requires righteousness, but it doesn’t require righteousness and wrath. It requires righteousness and forgiveness. Every person has a rite-of-passage story.Mine was when I bought my first car. It was a 1979 Camaro Berlinetta and the colour was horrific. It was burgundy and it had a burgundy vinyl interior. It was a used car so there were cigarette burn marks all over the interior and I don’t smoke but I bought the car because it was the right price. And I finally had a sporty car. For me it was one of the highest points of happiness a person can have. Recommended You should studyrock ’n’ roll bands to understand your relationship with your wife and relationships among politicians, because rock ’n’ roll bands will burn out unless they can manage each other’s egos. The Rolling Stones are still playing together. One minute they hate each other’s guts, then they love each other, then they hate each other. But they can manage each other’s egos. Paul [McCartney] and John [Lennon] couldn’t manage each other’s egos. With Donald Trump you get a team of one, but with Ronald Reagan he had a plaque that said you can get anywhere you want in life as long as you don’t care who gets the credit. Trump lives in a team of one. He’s too narcissistic to share any credit. A good rock ’n’ roll band or a good marriage or a good political relationship is a management of ego. The best bit of advice I ever receivedwas to keep going. No one ever turned to me and said, “Hey, Anthony, keep going.” But if I look at my grandparents, my dad, mom and at my relatives I respect, you keep going. And the best advice Donald Trump gave me was at a charity event in 2012. We were raising our profile and a reporter wrote a nasty article about me: I had a bad performance in my fund. He looked at me and said, “What are you, a big baby? If you get negative press it’s a sign you are doing something right.” Watch The US Election withThe Rest Is Politicson 5 November via YouTube",

    "news_title": "Investors’ ‘fear of missing out’ drives gold demand to record high",
    "news_content": " Leslie Hookin London Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Investors’ “fear of missing out” on gold’s rally has sparked record demand for the precious metal, even as high prices push central banks to scale back their purchases. The value of global demand passed $100bn for the first time in the third quarter of this year, according to industry body the World Gold Council, driven mainly by investor buying. The volume of globalgolddemand also rose to a record in the same period, up 5 per cent to 1,313 tonnes. The rush has helped drive the price of the yellow metal up 34 per cent this year and pushed it to a series of record highs, amid concerns about conflict in theMiddle Eastand Ukraine, and as central banks diversify away from the US dollar and western economies start cutting interest rates. Gold prices hit a new high on Wednesday of $2,788 a troy ounce. “Professional and institutional investors seemed to suffer a case of Fomo — fear of missing out — as gold’s performance repeatedly hit the headlines,” the WGC said in its quarterly report. This “Fomo” has meant that falls in the price of gold have been shorter and shallower than normal as investors pounce on softer prices. “There’s lots and lots of people looking to buy gold on a dip,” said John Reade, market strategist at the WGC. “A lot of people like gold, they wanted to be in gold, but they didn’t have it [in their portfolio] in the first half of the year, for whatever reason.” Total demand for investments, such as bars, coins or backing forexchange traded funds, more than doubled to reach 364mn tonnes in the third quarter, according to the report. Inflows into gold-backed ETFs hit 94 tonnes, a reversal after nine successive quarters of outflows. Family offices and wealthy individuals have been buying more gold in recent months due to concerns about government debt levels, particularly in the US, according to Reade. “Family offices tend to think in longer time horizons than retail investors. They think of generational wealth protection, the grandchildren — and they have become really concerned about debt levels, particularly in the US,” he said. However, central banks slowed their gold purchases during late summer, with buying falling 49 per cent year-on-year to 186 tonnes, the lowest quarterly level in two years. The sharp increase in gold prices since March had inhibited buying by central banks, the WGC said. Recommended As western governments cut interest rates, this is expected to continue to support gold prices. A non-yielding asset, gold typically benefits from lower rates because the opportunity cost of holding it is lower. Jewellery demand has been dented by high gold prices, with global consumption falling 7 per cent in the quarter compared with the previous year, according to the WGC. Jewellery represents about 40 per cent of global gold demand. “The absolute price level is quite mind-boggling to someone who’s been following gold for a long time,” said Reade. “Jewellery demand is being impacted.”",

    "news_content": "Prime Minister Robert Fico has tightened his grip on Slovakia using Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán’s playbook as inspiration The question of whether the US can stomach a woman as president remains open The erosion of the post-1945 world order requires the UK and its allies to define new forms of multilateralism The Republican candidate’s first presidential term was marked by infighting in the administration One does not need to subscribe to hyperbolic Tory rhetoric to recognise that this Budget heralded a major shift Increasing the burden on companies may not affect workers’ payslips today, but it won’t be long Rachel Reeves must now deliver on her investment plans, or taxes will rise even further Nothing separates the man from his 2016 self more than his disappearing qualms about capitalism The number of Americans not sure how they will vote has jumped since 2020 The stand-off on this issue has gone on for too long — a new framework is required Prime minister Shigeru Ishiba’s decision to call a snap election backfired Turkey hopes to exploit recent setbacks for Iran but an armed attack near Ankara has thrown a question mark over his plans Tech giants tout real wins today to justify huge investment tomorrow. Investors are supportive, to a point The British people will hope that higher spending delivers the better services they want The misses are largely down to inventory issues, rather than weaker demand Budget measures and missed opportunities show difficulty of raising large sums from highly mobile executives Gains may have been locked in too soon in anticipation of a bigger CGT increase Like Keanu, the chancellor uncovered a fake reality and valiantly resolved to defeat it Investors are understandably concerned despite the carmaker’s mooted job cuts and plant closures How fiscal excess strengthens the currency How I missed the boat on OpenAI, BrewDog and BT There is often bias towards candidates with established records, but companies should not be afraid to take a chance on youth He lost his job midway through our divorce and has stopped paying money to me and our child Retail banking is not only harder than it looks but also heavily regulated by watchdogs who take their duties very seriously Conditions are reverting to a time of solid, sustainable growth It is difficult to see the upcoming poll settling things definitively anywhere in the country Heavy investment is generating real revenue but as returns rise, so does rivalry Starboard is right to take drugmaker to task for bingeing on overpriced deals Investors in the Dutch healthcare conglomerate had until this week been enjoying a restorative patch A pan-continental body is not a cure-all for its debt problems Endless searching for a label to describe ethnic minority groups is ultimately futile The group is one of the sector’s top performers partly because of its ability to learn from mistakes Were the former president to return to the White House, it would encourage rightwing populists everywhere Harris is correct that the republic is in danger but that message may not suffice to prevent a Trump victory Grand global restructuring announcements have been all too familiar from the lender over the past decade And the sustainability of US growth outperformance History shows us that markets move forward regardless of who wins US elections",

    "news_content": "Rachel Reeves must now deliver on her investment plans, or taxes will rise even further Prime minister Shigeru Ishiba’s decision to call a snap election backfired A pan-continental body is not a cure-all for its debt problems The Caucasus republic’s future is at stake. So is western credibility Reeves must stabilise the economy, and pave the way for higher growth The west must restrain Netanyahu, or it will be haunted by his widening campaign The political class needs to relearn the value of fiscal discipline The demise of Byju’s holds lessons for other ambitious scale-ups and investors The west must tackle Russia’s interference with democracy in both countries The chancellor’s tax plans must avoid overburdening business and investors The take-off of AI will fuel a surge in demand for electricity As global co-operation wilts, the twins must adapt to new realities The UK government has constrained itself too much within its red lines Recent market rally will peter out without decisive policy action to boost the economy Starship shows what the entrepreneur can achieve when he sticks to what he does best Low taxes are just one factor influencing where young people decide to set up The UN climate conference is again being hosted by an authoritarian petrostate Households and the UK economy would be better off if cash piles were made to work harder Boosting employee rights should not undermine the goal of raising growth It is better to target the tech giant’s ability to entrench its power Transmission lines and energy storage solutions need to be deployed much faster Kyiv is not being given the support it needs to regain the upper hand over Russia The chancellor should begin moving the country to a more dynamic fiscal framework Hamas attack on Israel was horrific, but the response has inflamed the region The UK’s journey to low-carbon electricity is a case study for others",

    "news_content": "Prime Minister Robert Fico has tightened his grip on Slovakia using Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán’s playbook as inspiration Shares in the British chip designer, which is controlled by SoftBank, have trebled in price over the past year. But its ambitions go much further The once-lucrative market is now highly competitive and more Chinese EVs are being exported, compounding slower sales at home The former president has a radical global agenda for a second term, say allies and advisers — from Ukraine and the Middle East to pressurising America’s friends and foes The plane maker’s new boss has pledged culture change, but a vote to prolong a costly strike underlines the challenges he faces The country is holding elections that could decide whether it tilts towards Moscow or Brussels. Observers fear that violence may follow Interest rates have peaked and activity in several sectors is picking up, but some fear bad news is still to emerge Democrats are betting that a backlash against increasingly prohibitive laws will help them win votes in key battleground states After resisting calls to intervene, Beijing has made a sudden U-turn. But will the package be enough to get the economy back on track? The billionaire entrepreneur has gone all-in behind the Republican candidate. If he wins, the prize could be substantial influence over the administration More companies are committing to protect and improve biodiversity.

But many obstacles remain Machine learning could have transformative effects on developing economies and societies. But some fear a deepening digital divide After eight years of whirlwind construction activity and unprecedented spending, the kingdom’s new watchword is prudence Parents and children unhappy with traditional education are turning to online alternatives after the pandemic opened the door to new ways of learning Rightwing organisations have spent months and millions of dollars contesting ballot procedures and voter eligibility The Department of Justice’s proposal to shake up the company is a seminal moment for the industry. If it prevails in court, AI start-ups could benefit The three mediators thought they were on the cusp of a deal to prevent the Middle East conflict spreading. They were mistaken An FT investigation into the role of a British accountant, a London-based broker and Dubai companies in the acquisition of vessels New Delhi will soon recruit a western partner to produce its first world-class jet engine. The decision will be fraught with geopolitical implications Critics say the vice-president is yet to clearly define her foreign policy vision. But the contours of a philosophy are starting to emerge International criticism of the Gaza war has led many Israelis to retreat inwards. Feeling abandoned, they have backed the government’s military campaigns The US president had hoped to disentangle from the Middle East. But the turbulence in the region could influence the election and define his legacy After watching its support slip dramatically, the pro-unity party has its work cut out to stage a comeback in a looming election Chancellor Rachel Reeves says the government has a growth plan, but self-imposed red lines leave little room for manoeuvre",
