Uniswap is trading slightly below $8 on Thursday after rejecting a key resistance level on Wednesday. A successful close above this threshold could indicate a rally for the decentralized exchange. MicroStrategy released its third quarter financial report on Wednesday. The report revealed its 17.8% BTC yield year-to-date and discussed the company's plan to raise $42 billion to acquire more of the top cryptocurrency. Celestia is down about 9% following increased negative sentiment surrounding its cliff unlock, which is worth about 176 million TIA tokens. The token could see a correction if it fails to bounce off the $4.506 level. Crypto research firms Chaos Labs and Inca Digital revealed that prediction market Polymarket is guilty of performing wash trading on its presidential election market. Bitcoin price declines over 2% this week, but the bounce from a key technical level on the weekly chart signals chances of hitting a new all-time high in the short term. US spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $596 million in inflows until Thursday despite the increased profit-taking activity.
