    "news_title": "Ethereum – Scam or Trustworthy Coin for Investment?",
    "news_content": "To be traded as a new cryptocurrency, to monetize work and run applications I would define Ethereum as a decentralized software platform that operates a number of smart contracts. These are applications that operate exactly as they are programmed to. So there is no chance of fraud, censoring, downtime, or interference from third parties. Smart contracts are capable of operating on a customized blockchain, enabling developers to store debt registries, develop markets, and transfer funds according to instructions given in the past such as in futures contracts or wills, and several other things without any risk or middlemen involvement. The Ethereum project took off after a presale held in August 2014. It is managed by a Swiss non-profit organization such as the Ethereum Foundation. Developers of high calibre have contributed and are still contributing to the Ethereum network. The founder of Ethereum is a Toronto-based programmer called Vitalik Buterin. He was working on projects related to Bitcoin when he got the idea of creating a powerful platform capable of allowing developers to create blockchain apps. Buterin wanted to overcome the problems he faced while attempting to use the Bitcoin blockchain to develop apps. He strongly felt that the blockchain technology could be utilized for many things other than building financial apps. So he decided to create a more compatible and flexible blockchain. In 2013, he released theEthereum White Paper. It is a document on a new open source platform that could be used to create decentralized applications. The following year, he introduced Ethereum to the Bitcoin community. Among the co-founders of Ethereum are Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio, and Mihai Alisie. Buterin also worked with developers Joseph Lubin and Dr. Gavin Wood. Shortly after, theEthereum Yellow Paperwas released by Dr. Wood, introducing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a runtime environment in which all smart contracts are executed. Over the past year, the Ethereum community and network have undergone substantial growth. An initiative to bring the biggest companies in the world to the Ethereum network resulted in the formation of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. Recently, 86 major companies such as Intel, BP, and Microsoft joined the alliance. At the same time, a number of blockchain projects that use Ethereum’s blockchain technology have mushroomed. Early in 2017, the price of Ethereum rose by 1000% in just two months and this helped Ethereum to break into the mainstream. This attracted the attention of several investors and media houses such as Reuters, CNBC, and Quartz started covering the latest happenings on the network. Today, we have Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Ethereum (ETH) because of a fork on the Ethereum network. The price of ETH is higher than that of ETC. Ethereum has a number of advantages, such as the following: The Ethereum blockchain is similar in structure to the Bitcoin blockchain. Just like the Bitcoin blockchain, it is a history of transactions that is shared across the entire Ethereum network. In case of Ethereum, however, each node in the network also has a copy of the latest version of every smart contract created. Ethereum works through accounts that are similar to bank accounts. Ether, which is the name given to the cryptocurrency associated with Ethereum, is stored in wallets and can be transferred other accounts. This ensures that the funds are always stored somewhere without the need to have a continued relationship. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):To understand Ethereum fully, one must understand the EVM, which is one of the most innovative features of Ethereum. It is capable of reading and executing smart contracts compiled in the form of bytecodes. Each node in the Ethereum network uses its EVM to execute smart contracts. Since all the nodes in the network have copies of all transactions along with smart contract histories, they need to accept any change made any node in the network. Although the EVM reads and executes smart contracts written in bytecodes, it is possible to write smart contracts in languages such as Serpent and Solidity.  So in case of Ethereum, the activity of miners prevent bad behaviour such as double spending of the same money and rejection of smart contracts that haven’t been rewarded. Theprice of Ethereumwas slightly above $1200 at the end of 2017, but now its price has more than doubled. The cryptocurrency is just as volatile as Bitcoin and its value keeps shooting up and plummeting. In 2017, the price of Bitcoin increased by over 1000% while the price of Ethereum rose by around 700%, indicating that it is not far behind Bitcoin. This makes it the second largest cryptocurrency in the world and experts say that it has the potential of overtaking Bitcoin in 2018 owing to superior features that enable faster transaction and better security. Investors are increasingly considering possibilities of purchasing Ether in the hopes of selling it when the price is higher. Ethereum is still very young and it is still early to predict its future with certainty, but I can definitely say that its potential is massive. As more and more people become aware of it and it gets accepted in the mainstream, its price is expected to rise in leaps and bounds. Ethereum is already rushing towards the $1000 mark with breakneck speed, and this is quite impressive considering the fact that each Ether token was worth just a few dollars just a few months back. This massive increase in value cannot fail to remind investors of the way the value of Bitcoin increased. If you compare Bitcoin to DOS, Ethereum can be compared to Mac or Windows. While DOS contributed a great deal to the success of the computer, the fact that computers could enter the mainstream only because of Mac and Windows cannot be overlooked. This is because DOS is not only hard to understand, but also incompatible with several applications. On the other hand Mac and Windows are user friendly and enable the creation of more applications. Similarly, Ethereum allows developers to create thousands of user friendly apps. Moreover, it is worth noting that DevCon3, a conference of Ethereum developers, attracted over 2000 developers. This fact alone indicates that Ethereum’s future is bright. At the same time, there are other technologies that enable the creation of smart contracts; Ethereum is not the only one. It is just the most efficient and most innovative. For this reason alone, one can expect it to be the major platform for the creation of apps using blockchain technology for the next several years. If you have never purchased Ethereum before and would like to do so, I suggest that you read the following simple guide for beginners. Obtain an Ethereum Wallet:Before you attempt to purchase Ethereum, you should get hold of an Ethereum wallet, in which you can store all that Ether. Since there are several varieties of Ethereum wallets in the industry, you may find it difficult to make a wise choice. Basic understanding of the types of Ethereum wallets will help you choose a wallet that best suits your requirements. Hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger are not only reputed, but also very secure. If you don’t have too many Ether tokens to store, you could try a software wallet as hardware wallets tend to be more expensive. Software wallets are also available free of charge. However, they are less secure as they require an Internet connection to function and are, therefore, prone to hacker attacks. Some of the best software wallets are Jaxx, Exodus, and MyEtherWallet. Purchase Ether Tokens:Now that you have a wallet, you can easily purchase Ether tokens. There are many ways you can do this, as follows: Registering at an Ethereum exchange is one of the simplest ways to purchase Ether. Using the services of an Ethereum platform is also possible, but you should understand that there is a difference between an Ethereum exchange and an Ethereum platform. You cannot access your Ether at a platform and you cannot transfer them to others. You can only use the platform to purchase and sell your Ether for fiat currency such as Euro, Pound, and Dollar. If you have chosen to use an Ethereum platform, you do not need a wallet to store your Ether as the platform will never give you the actual Ether tokens. Coinbase – Ideal Way to Purchase Ether:Many experts say that the easiest way to purchase Ether tokens is through Coinbase. It is as simple as registering at Coinbase and including a payment method such as direct bank transfer or credit card. Once you have done this, you only have to visit the Buy/Sell section where you can buy as many Ether tokens as you wish. Coinbase, however, charges fees based on your preferred payment option. There are so many Ethereum wallets you can choose from, but here are five wallets I recommend the most for a variety of reasons. Mist:This is the official wallet for Ethereum. Once installed, it takes some time to synchronize with all the nodes on the Ethereum network. Once the synchronization is completed, it will prompt you to create a strong password. If you forget this password, you will never be able to access your Mist wallet. Your private keys and public keys are stored securely on the device. Moreover, Mist comes with the ShapeShift feature, which can be used to exchange Ether tokens for other currencies. MyEtherWallet:Unlike traditional wallets, MyEtherWallet allows users to control their private keys on their own devices. Since it is open source, it does not have any third party services. You can use its features to swap your Bitcoins to Ether tokens and vice versa. Coinbase:Coinbase is actually a popular Bitcoin wallet that has recently included support for Ethereum too. You will find that it is a fast, easy, and cheap way to store your Ether tokens. ETHAdress:You can use ETHAdress, an open source project to make a paper wallet that supports Ethereum. In case of paper wallets, the private and public keys can be actually printed. You also have the option of encrypting your private keys. ETHAdress is popular because it is cheap. Ledger Nano S:This is a hardware wallet that you can easily afford. It is secure because it allows you to store your Ether coins offline. When you wish to spend the Ether, the wallet will use your private key to sign the transaction.Ledger Nano Sfeatures an OLED screen that can be used to control transactions. Interestingly, the wallet is so secure that it can also be used on a computer that is hacked. There are several places online that teach you everything you want to know about the Ethereum network. Here is a list of some resources you can use to learn more about the network and to stay updated on the latest Ether prices and happenings.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Cash – New Cryptocurrency You Can Trust and Buy Right Now",
    "news_content": "To increase number of transactions per block, to decrease transaction fees, to reduce the size of individual transactions Bitcoin Cash is a brand new digital coin that was created during a hard fork in the original Bitcoin blockchain in August 2017. Since it increases block size, a larger number of transactions can be processed. According to the official website of Bitcoin Cash, it “brings sound money to the world,” thereby fulfilling all the promises that the original Bitcoin made. Some of the biggest advantages are reliable confirmations and low transaction fees. Since it has the potential to grow without restrictions and can be adopted at the international level, its future can be said to be secure. Bitcoin Cash welcomes everybody to join its community. To understand the history of Bitcoin Cash, you must understand some of the shortcomings of Bitcoin. Many in the Bitcoin community were worried about the fact that the block size in the original Bitcoin blockchain would drastically reduce the transaction fees and thus have an adverse effect on the popularity of Bitcoin. The limit on block size was imposed when the value of Bitcoins was low, but this turned out to be a disadvantage when the value of Bitcoins increased. As a result, the transaction time turned out to be too long. Over the years, several solutions to this problem were suggested, but any change to the Bitcoin code requires the consensus of miners and developers, which could take time. As a result, groups of miners forked the code and created blockchain ledgers of their own. Bitcoin Cash is the result of such a fork that turned out to be very successful unlike similar forks such as Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT. When the 478,558th block was formed on the Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoin Cash miners and Bitcoin miners went their separate ways. It took Bitcoin Cash miners nearly six hours to create the first block on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Once this happened, the split became official. Initially, there were some problems on the network, but ultimately, all these problems were resolved. Later, wipeout protection and replay protection were enforced on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. However, Bitcoin Cash still needs a lot of infrastructure support. Several exchanges and wallets are yet to introduce support for Bitcoin Cash, but all this may change in the near future. Bitcoin Cash has several advantages over Bitcoin, and here are a few of these advantages: Bitcoin Cash is Scalable:Unlike its predecessor Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is more scalable. The first step to increase scalability was taken when the limit on the size of each block on the blockchain was increased to 8MB. SigHash:A new and improved type of transaction signature improves the security of the hardware wallet, gives replay protection, and eliminates the problem of quadratic hashing. Difficult Adjustment Algorithm (DAA):This algorithm makes it easy for miners to migrate from the original Bitcoin blockchain whenever they desire. It also protects against fluctuations in the hash rates. Decentralization:Bitcoin Cash is 100% decentralized as it features several independent developers contributing to its software. Moreover, political and social changes have no effect on it and no project, individual, or group can establish control over it. According to the official website of the Bitcoin Cash project: “Bitcoin Cash is a peer-to-peer electronic cash for the Internet. It is fully decentralized, with no central bank and requires no trusted third parties to operate.” There are a number of similarities between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, but there are some differences too. Unlike Bitcoin, the size of each block on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is 8 MB. Bitcoin Cash will not have any segwit or features such as “replace by fee.” But it comes with full protection against wipeout and replay. It is capable of adjusting difficulties related to “proof of work” faster than it happens in Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin Cash comes from a hard fork in the Bitcoin blockchain, all those who owned Bitcoins received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash coins provided they stored their Bitcoins in wallets and not in exchanges. Bitcoin Cash has addressed the problem of replay attack better than any other cryptocurrency in the industry. Replay attacks are defined as data transmission that is delayed or repeated with malicious intent. Bitcoin Cash uses redefined algorithms to protect against replay attacks. The success of a cryptocurrency depends a great deal on its miners, and Bitcoin Cash is no exception to this rule. Recently, Bitcoin Cash’s hash rate has greatly increased because the large number of miners it has attracted. The cryptocurrency succeeded in attracting miners because it decreased the proof of work difficulty rate. The proof of work difficulty rate continues to adjust according to the number of miners on the blockchain. The rate goes down when the number of miners is smaller. When Bitcoin Cash was just created, it hardly had any miners. As a result of this, its proof of work difficulty rate plummeted, a fact that attracted a number of miners who saw the lucrative opportunities. As a result, a large number of miners migrated to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from the Bitcoin blockchain. When this happened, Bitcoin’s hashing power decreased by 50 percent, increasing its transaction fees and decreasing its transaction time. Thevalue of Bitcoin Cashhad shot up to US$3000 before dropping to US$2500 in the middle of January 2018. Some people felt that the price will drop further to US$2000, but that did not happen, indicating the fact that Bitcoin Cash is still in a good position. I cannot predict the future of Bitcoin Cash in certainty. In fact, no one can. Nobody knows how the new cryptocurrency will fare in the future. Nobody knows its long-term effects on Bitcoin. However, a number of experts are absolutely sure that Bitcoin Cash is the result of the most successful hard fork ever on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Cash is definitely an experiment, the results of which will provide valuable lessons in blockchain technology. Right now, everybody is happy about the block size of 8 MB, but nobody knows what impact this increased size will have on miners in the future. We still cannot say if the hard fork will definitely solve all the problems of the Bitcoin blockchain. It is also too early to say if Bitcoin Cash will race ahead of Bitcoin and assume the position it currently enjoys. The following are a few methods to get hold of some Bitcoin Cash: Method #1:If you already had some Bitcoins in your wallet when the hard fork took place, you will automatically receive Bitcoin Cash coins equal to the number of Bitcoins in your wallet. On the downside, you will find it difficult to withdraw your Bitcoin Cash coins because wallets and exchanges are still confused about the hard fork. You may have to wait several months for the issues to get resolved. Right now, a number of exchanges such as Bithumb, CEO.IX, and Kraken have realized the potential of Bitcoin Cash and make it very easy for people to purchase and sell Bitcoin Cash. Method #2:Investors can just visit an exchange such as Bittrex, Kraken, and CEO.IX and purchase the required number of Bitcoin Cash. These exchanges not only facilitate Bitcoin Cash trading, but are also reporting an increase in trading volume. These exchanges not only display information about demand and supply, but also provide the latest Bitcoin Cash prices, making it easy for you to purchase as many as you wish. Using the Bitcoin Cash:You can use your Bitcoin Cash by either spending it on other altcoins or by converting them into Bitcoins. However, you should take into consideration the following fact while spending Bitcoin Cash. The addresses for Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin are similar and this leads to a lot of confusion at present. If you reveal the address of one, you will be automatically revealing the address of the other, and this could create privacy and security issues. You can choose from a number of Bitcoin Cash wallets, but I would like to recommend the following five: Coinomi:This is a mobile wallet that features support for multiple cryptocurrencies. You can use it to store a variety of altcoins along with your Bitcoins. Coinomi has support for the largest number of cryptocurrencies at present. Since Coinomi is Hierarchical Deterministic (HD), you are in complete control of private keys. Moreover, when you register at Coinomi, you will receive a seed phrase with 15 words, which you must use in order to restore your Coinomi wallet whenever required. Right now, Coinomi supports only Android devices, but plans to support iOS devices as well. Electron Cash:Since this is a light wallet, you don’t have to download Bitcoin Cash’s complete node. It was created by a fork in Electrum, a wallet that is popular among owners of Litecoins. Electron Cash supports desktops and Android devices. The wallet also provides a seed phrase, which can be used to back it up. BU Bitcoin Cash Client:The Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) community has released the latest edition of Bitcoin Cash, which will be offered “unofficially” till the members of the community decide whether they should approve the hard fork. This is a wallet with full support for Bitcoin Cash and is compatible with operating systems such as Mac, Linux, and Windows. KeepKey:This is a hardware wallet that now supports Bitcoin Cash. Although it isn’t a lightweight wallet, it cannot be denied that it is doing a great job by supporting 5+ cryptocurrencies. You won’t be disappointed if you use KeepKey, but you will find better products in hardware wallets such as Ledger Nano S and Trezor, which are not only convenient, but also offer high-speed integration for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Classic UAHF Client:This wallet has been Bitcoin Cash compatible right from its launch. When you install it, you can easily follow the blockchain ledger of Bitcoin Cash. The wallet is compatible with operating systems such as Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can use the following resources to stay updated on the latest happenings on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain: Bitcoin Cash Website Bitcoin Forum #Bitcoincash Twitter Bitcoin Cash FAQ Bitcoin Cash Reddit David is a forex trader and writer who has spent the last few years giving his opinion and spreading news about oncoming markets and trading tips.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Review – Is Bitcoin Legal or Scam? Safe Places to Buy",
    "news_content": "To create a decentralized payment system, to give people monetary freedom Bitcoin is the world’s first cryptocurrency, a variety of virtual currency that is not controlled or regulated by anyone. It is digital currency that is created on computers through the use of software involving complex mathematical problems. Today, one can purchase products and services using bitcoins, just as one uses Euros, Pounds, and Dollars. Bitcoin is attractive to most of its users because of its decentralized nature. Nobody is in control of the bitcoin network, a fact that makes many people feel comfortable because it means that their money is not controlled by any bank or financial institution. Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to be the group or individual who founded the cryptocurrency in 2008. Nakamoto’s research paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” was the first of its kind on cryptocurrency. However, he stopped working on the bitcoin network after 2010 stating that he has “moved on to other things” and that the network “is in good hands with Gavin and everyone.” Is Satoshi is the real founder of the cryptocurrency? One cannot say for sure because too many people have claimed to have created Bitcoin. So, nobody knows the identity of the creator of this cryptocurrency. One can only hope that the future will reveal the identity of the man who created Bitcoin and now owns 1.5 million bitcoins stored in multiple bitcoin wallets. The number of bitcoin users is on the rise, and here are a few good reasons for this development: Speedy Transactions:Bitcoin transactions are super fast chiefly because the digital currency is not controlled by any bank. The transactions take about 10 minutes if the merchants demand confirmation; otherwise they are instantaneous. Cheap:Those who use credit/debit cards will have to pay transaction fees to their bank or credit card issuing company. In case of bitcoin, the transaction fees are either minimal or totally absent. Decentralized Currency:Since Bitcoin is not controlled by any bank or financial institution, it belongs to the person who is using Bitcoin. Banks can take away their customers’ money anytime, but this can never happen in case of bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is, therefore, ideal for those who do not trust banks. No Chargeback:You cannot retrieve bitcoins that have already been used to make a payment. In other words, you cannot reverse a bitcoin transaction, a fact that greatly minimizes fraud. Safe and Secure:If a customer wants to pay through credit card, he/she will have to reveal a great deal of card information. Many customers don’t like to reveal their card information as they feel that it can be unsafe. In many cases, credit card information ends up getting stolen. This can never happen in case of Bitcoin because all bitcoin transactions require two keys—a public key that is visible to everybody and a private key that is visible only to the bitcoin user. As long as bitcoin users keep their private key really “private” and don’t reveal it to anybody, their bitcoin transaction will be safe and secure. No Inflation:Bitcoin is not like fiat currency, which can be created according to the government’s will and injected into the economy, leading to inflation. On the other hand, it is designed in such a way that only 21 million bitcoins can be created. In the world of bitcoin, therefore, there will never be any inflation. Anonymous:Bitcoin users can make purchases anonymous. At the same time, the blockchain technology, which powers bitcoin, is absolutely transparent. Although nobody knows the identity of the person behind a bitcoin address, everybody can see exactly how many bitcoins he/she has and get hold of all the transaction details. Trust Factor is Unnecessary:While using bitcoin, one doesn’t have to trust anybody. Bitcoin transactions are digital signed, which makes them secure. Each transaction will be verified by unknown miners, after which they are completed. Merchants don’t have to know the customers’ identity. You are the Sole Owner:Your bitcoin wallet belongs only to you and to nobody else. So nobody can freeze it and deny you access. You are the sole owner of the public as well as private key that comprises your bitcoin address. You Can Create Bitcoins:You can get hold of bitcoins by either purchasing them or mining them. However, you need a lot of electricity and powerful computers to mine your own bitcoins. Before trying to understand how Bitcoin works, one must understand that Bitcoin is nothing but a software program that is used to create a decentralized cryptocurrency. The Technology:Bitcoin is powered by blockchain technology. A blockchain is a chain of chronologically arranged information blocks. Since the information blocks in case of Bitcoin is mostly information regarding bitcoin transactions, it resembles a ledger that is publicly available. It can be downloaded and perused at any time by anybody in the world. Interestingly, nobody controls this “public ledger” or keeps an eye on this network. Instead, it is closely watched by everybody who is associated with it. To use Bitcoin, you don’t have to know anybody on the network or to trust anybody. As long as the software is functioning in perfect order, its cryptographic protocol makes sure that each information block is attached to the previous one to create a long chain that cannot be corrupted by any force. This public ledger is maintained through a process called mining. The bitcoin network is made up of not only bitcoin traders, but also bitcoin miners who carefully record and verify each transaction on the blockchain. The chain never splits, and even if it does, in what is called a “fork,” the longer chain has more validity than the shorter chain. Bitcoin miners are scattered all over the world and hardly know one another. They verify bitcoin transactions by creating a hash that appears in the next block. If any bitcoin user tries to alter a previous transaction, the hash changes in all the blocks and alerts the network. The fact that no individual can tamper with the blockchain without alerting the entire network makes Bitcoin safe and secure. Since generating hashes is so easy, the mining process needs something called “proof of work,” which involves creating a hash that is a value less than the current target. Using Bitcoin:The average bitcoin user, however, doesn’t really need to understand all the above in order to use Bitcoin. They simply need to understand wallets and keys. To become a bitcoin owner, one requires a public key, which is something like a username, and a private key, which is something like a password. If you want to receive bitcoins from someone, you should give them your public key, which is also referred to as bitcoin address. If you want to send bitcoins to someone, you will have to use your private key as well. This means that you can easily receive bitcoins, but need to verify your identity by using your private key in order to send bitcoins. You also need to get a bitcoin wallet in order to use bitcoin. There are two types of bitcoin wallets—hot wallets that are completely online and cold wallets that are offline. You can easily set up a bitcoin wallet at Coinbase, which also serves as a bitcoin exchange where you can buy and sell bitcoins. Bitcoin transactions are processed through gateways such as GoCoin and BitPay. Transaction Fees:Usually, Bitcoin is free to use, but one may have to pay nominal fees to the servers that support the bitcoin mining network, the mining pool they have joined, and the exchange that converts bitcoins into fiat currency and vice versa. Server owners charge nominal transaction fees whenever bitcoins are sent across their servers and bitcoin mining pools will request nominal support fees from those who join the pool. But these fees are much smaller than the transaction fees charged by banks, financial institutions, and credit card companies. The value of one bitcoin changes with every passing moment. Those interested can find out the latest value of Bitcoin at places such asCoindesk. An Express report of December 2017 quotes Nicholas Gregory, CEO of CommerceBlock, as having said that 16 million bitcoins have already been mined and are currently in existence. The bitcoin software has been designed to stop the further creation of bitcoins once there are 21 million of them in existence. This is believed to happen somewhere in 2040. Early in April 2013, bitcoin prices fell to $50 from $266 before recovering to $100. In June 2013, the price dropped to $70. Although it fell to $110 when the FBI seized the Silk Road, it shot up to $200 a few weeks later. So as one sees, bitcoin is a volatile currency. While its price fell by nearly $300 in March 2015, it shot up to $750 in June 2016. In January 2017, it fell by 30% only to reach a high of $1,242 in March 2017.  On December 22, 2017, Bitcoin lost one-third of its value in just one day and plummeted to $14,000. The current value of Bitcoin is US$14,462. Experts say that its price will continue to rise in the following years, a fact that makes it great for investment. Since the number of merchants choosing to accept payments through Bitcoin is on the rise, consumers can use bitcoins to purchase a variety of products and services. Still, consumers must remember that Bitcoin is still in the experimental stage and has a long way to go before it can achieve the status enjoyed by fiat currencies such as Dollar, Euro, and Pound. Some experts feel that governments will adopt the blockchain technology in the near future and will alter their currencies to make them similar to bitcoins. But others feel that cryptocurrencies will continue to be used along with fiat currencies, but will not be invested in as much as precious metals such as gold. Investors are advised to treat Bitcoin with caution and to invest in it only if they have money they don’t mind losing. You can purchase bitcoins in two ways. First, you can purchase them from people who use virtual marketplaces, just as you purchase any other service or product online. Second, you can visit cryptocurreny exchanges such as Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gatehub, and Kraken to purchase bitcoins. The biggest and most reputed of bitcoin exchanges are Coinbase. To buy bitcoins, you also need to create a bitcoin wallet. You can choose from software wallets or hardware wallets. While software wallets are applications that can be connected with one’s bank account, hardware wallets resemble memory sticks. If you are ready to purchase bitcoins, follow these steps: Step #1:Create a bitcoin wallet by signing up at websites such as MyCelium, Exodus, Coinbase, and Blockchain.info. Step #2:If you have opted for a software wallet, you will have to download the application at the Google Play Store or the Apple Store. You can also get bitcoin wallets designed for desktop use. Step #3:Register accounts at bitcoin exchanges such as Poloniex, Coinbase, Bitfinex, Kraken, BitPanda, CEX.io, and BitStamp. Step #4:The next step is to visit the Buy section of the exchange and input the number of bitcoins you wish to purchase. Since the current value of Bitcoin is high, you cannot purchase more than one Bitcoin at a time. You can use banking methods such as bank transfer or credit card to purchase as much as 0.5 bitcoin to as little 0.00000001. Irrespective of whether one opts for hardware wallet or a software wallet, one must make sure that it allows users to control their own keys, has appropriate security and backup facilities, is easy to use and compatible with a variety of operating systems, and is home to an active community of developers. I recommend the following five Bitcoin wallets: Exodus:Created in the middle of 2015 by Daniel Castagnoli and J. P. Richardson, Exodus is a desktop wallet that can be used for free. You don’t have to verify your identity or register an account to useExodus. Jaxx:If you are in the habit of using multiple cryptocurrencies, I suggest that you useJaxx. It comes with features such as seed key backup and shapeshift.io integration, which makes currency exchange easier. The wallet is available on iOS devices and Linus/MAC desktops. Trezor:If you are looking for a hardware wallet, you could check outTrezor, produced by a Czech Republic company called SatoshiLabs. Trezor supports multiple currencies and is compatible with Android devices, Linux, and Windows. CoPay:CoPayis a BitPay offering that is compatible with Windows Phone, Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and Max OS X. It is easy to use and comes with a shared account feature. MyCelium:MyCeliumis the favourite bitcoin wallet for many users because it is a well-established and open source wallet with a wide range of security and privacy features. Since it is open source, it gets upgraded continuously. But it can be used only on mobile devices, not desktops.

    "news_title": "Solana Acquires Edge Capacity Provider Edgevana",
    "news_content": "Solana, a Web3 blockchain business, has forged a cooperation with Edgevana, a startup providing scalable capacity in Edge locations. In 32 different Edge locations, which are controlled by Edgevana, Solana will install 500 bare metal servers. As a result, the “validator” servers of Solana, which control the hashing as well as other blockchain tasks, and the “RPCs,” servers that employ remote procedure requests from apps that utilize the Solana blockchain as a resource, would benefit from their installation. Mark Thiele and Subhan Jahromi, veterans of the data center industry, created Edgevana in 2019 with the goal of pooling Edge capacity so that applications may access it from a single place and employ it across different venues without the need to sign several contracts with specific data center providers. Some 50 data centers and various network service providers have partnered with the firm while it has been in stealth mode, Thiele says. He stated “Edgevana was established with the intention of separating the data center providers who were serving as the single point of failure for network and data center based processes. An potential in the Web3 domain drew our attention away from the stealth mode we had been operating in. Although this wasn’t the market we had in mind when we started out, it turned out that the way we were constructing the business made it a good match for Web3 enterprises.” Thiele further pointed out: “These blockchain systems require high-performance processing and almost limitless scalability, combined with the speed, safety, and resilience of a commercial data center. All of this must be accomplished without sacrificing decentralization or network safety.” For Solana, he revealed that Edgevana has “placed 500 servers in 32 different locations in 22 different countries up as a private offering of bare metal as a service, with a front end that enables client paying.” Customers of Solana will be able to purchase and install validators with a single click once the employment is complete. It would then make it possible for Solana to observe in great detail how the framework is being utilized and how it is working. It will also make it possible for Solana to charge clients who want to operate validators and any apps that want to utilize the blockchain. Solana Foundation executive director Dan Albert said “Because to this agreement, cryptocurrency fans who want to increase their support for the Solana blockchain have access to the most advanced edge computing available, which is safely positioned in enterprise-grade facilities and can be accessed anywhere and at any moment. Validators who utilize Edgevana for onboarding are able to cut their hardware expenditures, have an onboarding procedures that is easy and quick, obtain an inexpensive month-to-month agreement, and grow without sacrificing safety.” Thiele has stated that more collaborations will come up in the future.

    "news_title": "SHIB and D3 Global Collaborate to Introduce .shib Domain in Web3 Era",
    "news_content": "In a significant move towards expanding its digital presence, SHIB and the broader Shiba Inu ecosystem have entered into a strategic partnership with D3 Global, a cutting-edge domain company. The collaboration aims to facilitate the application process for acquiring the .shib top-level domain (TLD) during the upcoming application window led by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This innovative partnership positions SHIB as a pioneer in bringing interoperability to Domain Name System (DNS) domains within the Web3 industry. SHIB, renowned for its decentralized ecosystem, has distinguished itself as one of the early adopters of collaboration with D3 Global. D3, a company actively engaging with prominent Web3 projects, is focused on securing TLDs through ICANN. This move underscores the significance of SHIB’s commitment to advancing digital infrastructure and identity standards within the Web3 domain. Shytoshi Kusama, the Lead Developer of Shiba Inu, emphasized the partnership’s potential to extend beyond the existing #ShibArmy, providing direct access to the SHIB ecosystem for over 5 billion internet users globally. The integration of real domains into SHIB marks a substantial milestone, aligning with the decentralized ecosystem’s vision for digital identities. Additionally, it positions SHIB for sustained revenue generation within its expanding ecosystem. D3 Global’s patent-pending platform represents a fusion of traditional Internet infrastructure and Web3 ecosystems, introducing what the company terms as “real Web3 domains.” With decades of collective industry experience in DNS and Web3 technologies, D3 aims to enhance utility, security, and universal access for these domains. Shayan Rostam, Co-founder of D3, emphasized the integral role of domain names, which have been the backbone of the Internet for nearly four decades, in the emerging Web3 era. D3’s approach involves collaborating with leading blockchain ecosystems to expedite the adoption of Web3 and modern digital identities. Users can anticipate early access to D3’s platform, signifying a step towards the platform’s mission to deliver interoperable digital identities across existing internet infrastructure and Web3 ecosystems. Through the collaboration with D3, the #ShibArmy will gain the capability to collect and showcase their digital identities. This advancement replaces conventional, impersonal wallet addresses, introducing a more user-friendly experience and aligning with current internet standards. The existing Shib Name Service (SNS) will seamlessly transition to D3’s infrastructure, enhancing the overall user experience and establishing a robust foundation for interoperable digital identities within the global Domain Name System. The SHIB ecosystem encompasses several quality technologies, including SHIB: The Metaverse and Shibarium. The latter, a Layer 2 blockchain, serves as a foundational element, offering scalability, security, and innovation to support a decentralized world. In conclusion, the collaboration between SHIB and D3 Global marks a significant stride in the Web3 era, paving the way for enhanced digital identities and domain interoperability. This partnership underscores SHIB’s commitment to innovation and sets the stage for a more user-centric and interconnected Web3 landscape.

    "news_content": "Cryptocurrency is a term that we hear more of with every passing day and the buzz is unlikely to stop anytime soon. Bitcoinis probably the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency there is at the moment, but there are several other cryptocurrencies apart from just the Bitcoin as well. Some other popular cryptocurrencies areEthereum,Ripple,Litecoin, etc. So, what is a cryptocurrency? You may ask people this question and get different, vague explanations from them as to what a cryptocurrency is. Despite its growing popularity, there seems to be some ambiguity and confusion as to what exactly a cryptocurrency is and this makes it difficult for lay men to wrap their heads around the concept. At its essence, a cryptocurrency is digital currency which isprotected through cryptography, a technology that makes duplicating or counterfeiting the currency virtually impossible. Furthermore, it also facilitates lighting quick, cheap transactions that are peer to peer without the requirement of a third party such as a bank. These transactions may also be anonymous which is yet another added inherent advantage of a cryptocurrency. 109 user ratingsStart Trading 109 user ratingsStart Trading 110 user ratingsStart Trading 110 user ratingsStart Trading 108 user ratingsStart Trading 113 user ratingsStart Trading 111 user ratingsStart Trading 116 user ratingsStart Trading 114 user ratingsStart Trading 111 user ratingsStart Trading There were digital currencies based on the concept prior to the Bitcoin, but they failed to really take off.Bitcoinis solely responsible for putting cryptocurrencies on the map. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by either a single person or a group of individuals that with the alias name –Satoshi Nakamotoand there has been no looking back since then. During the initial stages right after its launch, the Bitcoin was worth literally nothing, however, at the time of writinga single Bitcoin is valued at $11,075 USD. With such an incredible spike in worth, it is no wonder that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as the Bitcoin has really turned a lot of heads and people are flooding in to get their hands on Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies as an investment. Having said that, most people who have not dealt with Bitcoins or cryptocurrencies may find it a bit challenging and confusing when it comes to actually purchasing cryptocurrencies. When you look up how to buy cryptocurrencies on the internet, you will most likely be told that you need two things: Let’s look at what these are and the procedure you can follow to buy cryptocurrency usingtraditional fiat currencies(such as theUS Dollaror theBritish Pound) on some of the most trusted and legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges on the World Wide Web. So, without any further ado, let’s start answering some questions. As mentioned earlier, cryptocurrency transactions do not require the involvement of any third – party organizations such as a bank or any other kind of financial institution. Ergo, you will need to store your cryptocurrency coins somewhere (like how you store your traditional fiat currency monies in bank accounts). This iswhere cryptocurrency wallets come into the picture. A cryptocurrency wallet is basically where you can store your cryptocurrencies coins, make payments from and receive payments to. A cryptocurrency wallet will have two addresses, a public address and a private address. The public address maybe shared with anyone and that person may then use the public address to make deposit or payments to your wallet as required. However, the private address will have to be kept confidential, and this what allows you access and control over your own wallet (the private address can be compared to thesecret pin associated with your credit card or debit cardwhich allows you to withdraw money, make payments and such). There are several cryptocurrency wallets that you can use, you may choose the best wallet for you depending on the type of cryptocurrencies you want to store and deal with and also based on personal preference with regards touser interface, charges, features on offer etc. BTCLTCETHDASHBHC+ 8 more coins More Info BTCLTCETHENJERC20 More Info BTCLTCUNOZETSYS+ 11 more coins More Info BTCLTCSTRAT More Info BTCLTCETHDASHEOS+ 13 more coins More Info A cryptocurrency exchange is very similar to a forex exchange. Essentially, a cryptocurrency exchange is to cryptocurrencies what a forex exchange is to traditional, fiat currencies. A cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform which typicallybrings together sellers and buyers of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, this is a platform where you can trade cryptocurrencies for one another or trade traditional fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies and vice versa. It must be noted that some cryptocurrency exchanges do not support traditional fiat currencies and only encourage trading between cryptocurrencies, obviously, these may not be the ideal platform for someone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies for the first time. Going ahead, I will help you break down the procedure of purchasing cryptocurrencies on some of the most secure and trusted crypto currency exchanges in the world. Please note that some cryptocurrency exchanges also offer a cryptocurrency wallet out of the box, so you don’t have to setup another wallet separately, and you can just use one account to access both the exchange and the cryptocurrency wallet. 101 user ratingsStart Trading 104 user ratingsStart Trading 106 user ratingsStart Trading 104 user ratingsStart Trading 113 user ratingsStart Trading First things first, if you are not familiar with Coinbase, then you should know that it is thesingle biggest Bitcoin broker in the world. It is available to users in over 30 countries and is one of the most popular Bitcoin exchanges on the internet. Especially with regards to first time Bitcoin buyers, this is one of the most convenient places for you to purchase Bitcoins as you can use traditional payment methods and currencies to be able to do so and the procedure is rather straight forwards. Apart from Bitcoin, you can also buy Ethereum on Coinbase. In order to buy your first Bitcoin, just follow these simple steps. Bittrex is an online cryptocurrency exchange which is highly popular and used by millions around the world. Bittrex is known for the sheer amount of trading pairs that it has to offer. UnlikeCoinbase.comwhere your options are basically Bitcoin and Ethereum, at Bittrex, you choose from a whole array of crypto coins. Bittrex is among the top three cryptocurrency exchanges in terms of trading volume and you can rest assured that it is a completely legitimate cryptocurrency exchange platform that offers not just some of the fastest and most convenient crypto currency trading options, but also highly secure trading. Buying cryptocurrency on Bittrexis not best suited for someone who has never brought any cryptocurrency in the past, instead, it is a great option for those who have already purchased Bitcoins and are looking to venture into other cryptocurrencies that also show potential of a promising future. Now that you have some Bitcoins, you can use them to purchase other crypto currencies or altcoins. To be able to do this on Bittrex, follow the below step: Binance, like Bittrex is where you can buy tons of other crypto coins and not just the Bitcoin. However, likeBittrex, you will need Bitcoins to be able to purchase other crypto coins. Binance is basically another option and an alternative to Bittrex. A lot many times, Bittrex closes registrations to new members as they start experiencing trouble managing the sheer load of the number of users and all of their data. Binance makes the perfect platform to continue your trading at this point so you never lose out. In order touse Binance to buy cryptocurrency, you will need to have Bitcoins. You can buy Bitcoins as described in an exchange platform that accepts traditional fiat currencies. One of the easiest ways to buy Bitcoin is on Coinbase.com. The procedure to buy Bitcoins on Coinbase.com has even been explained in detail above. Once you have your hands on some Bitcoin, you can then create a Binance account and start venturing into other cryptocurrencies such asRipple, Ethereum and more. In order to buy cryptocurrency on Binance.com, follow the simple steps below.      © 2024CoinTrust.com. * DISCLAIMER: All information provided in CoinTrust is merely for informational purposes, we are not an investment advisor and not affiliated with any companies or ICO/Cryptocurrency Projects.

    "news_title": "Cryptocurrency Mining – Best 15 Mining Hardware and how it works.",
    "news_content": "Cryptocurrency mining is something that is generating a lot of excitement among tech savvy people at present. Everybody who knows about cryptocurrenciesand mining wants to mine altcoins and bitcoins and earn money. The industry is very young and the concept is brand new. In spite of this, cryptocurrency mining has travelled a long way from theblockchain technologyand the bitcoins that were born as its by-product back in 2009. Today you have thousands of cryptocurrencies that you can either mine or trade in, and either way, you are going to make money. More Info More Info More Info More Info More Info More Info More Info More Info More Info More Info  The cryptocurrency industry has two varieties of coins to offer —pre-mined coinsandminable coins. Most digital coins are mineable because of the nature of the blockchain technology on which they are based. But some coins are pre-mined by their founders and developers and later sold to investors. Founders and developers can make a lot of money from their pre-mined coins, but investors can later claim a share of the profits. Mining is interesting because of the rewards you can earn for each block you generate. Most cryptocurrencies reward the individual or mining pool that works out solutions to cryptographic problems. Since the solutions are based entirely on the solutions of previously generated blocks, no one can find solutions for blocks that are to be generated in the far future. A block can be defined as a series of cryptographic signatures on the transactions it stores. Each transaction carries a fee, part of which goes to reward the miner. Each block has its own difficulty value, which can increase or decrease. Difficulty values serve to keep the rate of block generation constant. For example, the Bitcoin network has beendesigned to create a block every 10 minutes. In case ofEthereum, blocks are created once in 16 seconds. Cryptocurrency mining is thus just like searching for gold in a pile of dirt. If you are lucky, you will find large nuggets. Otherwise, you will get nothing but dirt. Otherwise, you will find just a few grains of gold. Your success also depends on location. If the above-mentioned pile of dirt is located favourably, your chance of finding gold gets better. In case of cryptocurrency mining, however, “location” corresponds to “hardware.” You need excellent hardware to mine your coins. If you are interested in cryptocurrency mining, you have plenty of options ahead of you. You can run certain algorithms tolerably well on CPUs, but others need GPUs and some others requirecustom-made ASICs. When the cryptocurrency mining industry was in its infancy, solo mining was possible. You had to download or compile the right mining software and wallet for the coin you wanted to mine. The next step was to configure the software so that you could join the cryptocurrency network of your choice. Finally, you had todedicate your ASIC, GPU, or CPU to the work of mining. Your only aim as a solo miner was to solve cryptographic problems and find solutions to blocks before anybody else and earn rewards. Today, solo mining is difficult because software takes up too much space and requires a lot of bandwidth. For example, youneed 145GB of space to accommodate the entire Bitcoin blockchainand the syncing process takes a lot of time. Over a period of time, miners were required to contribute only a percentage of their computational power to find part of a block and earn part of the rewards. But then the difficulty value of cryptocurrencies increased, making it difficult for individual miners to mine coins anymore. This led to thedevelopment of mining pools. Your chances of earning rewards increase if you just join a mining pool. This is because a mining pool does the work of mining collectively and distributes rewards among its members. Your hardware contributes hashrate and receives a percentage of the block rewards. Mining cryptocurrencies is all about purchasing hardware and participating in a mining pool. You also have to download some software, configure it according to your mining pool and hardware and you will start earning coins. As soon as you have joined a mining pool, you will receive detailed instructions on how to get started. However, it isn’t as easy as sounds because all hardware and software isn’t the same. If you want to mine coins, you have to interact a lot with other miners. So you must join mining forums like BitcoinTalk and Github.com to improve your knowledge of cryptocurrencies, mining pools, providers of mining equipment, and so on. Once you have learned everything about mining, you may find it difficult to identify the best coin for mining. This is because coins are volatile and their value keeps fluctuating due to various factors. To make matters worse, the unregulated nature of the blockchain technology has given rise to a number of scam coins, which are also known as shit coins. To make any profits from your mining activities, you should know exactly what coin to mine. You should also be ready to mine multiple cryptocurrencies. The following are some details on how to mine various types of cryptocurrencies: Although the oldest form of cryptocurrency mining, bitcoin mining is still popular and profitable. The difficulty value ensures that the number of blocks generated every day remains constant. To mine bitcoins, you need powerful hardware. You can no longer do it with a standard CPU. Instead, you need to purchase hardware such asAntMinerS9, which has a power of 14,000,000 MHashs/s; theAntMinerU3, which has a power of 63,000 MH/s; or theBFL SC, which has a power of 10,000 MH/s. Once you have obtained the proper hardware tomine bitcoins, you must join a reputed mining pool to be able to earn block rewards. You have to download software that will help you control your mining rig. Once you have established your bitcoin mining rig, you must download a wallet to store all those bitcoins you earn. The Bitcoin wiki says that those who generate a block in Bitcoin blockchain network get areward of 25 bitcoins. Thisreward will be halved every time 210,000 blocks are generated. In addition, the miner gets part of transaction fees. These rewards serve as incentives for miners to do the hard work of solving cryptographic problems and creating blocks. Ethereum is expected to evolve into the next Bitcoin. When you join an Ethereum mining pool, you will be mining Ether, which is what the cryptocurrency associated with Ethereum is called. As long as your personal computer hasGraphic Card (GPU) with a minimum RAM of 2GB, you can mine Ether coins. You need GPUs because theirspeed is 200 times higher than that of standard CPUs. But you need to be aware that Ethereum mining requires a lot of electricity. To mine Ether, you have todownload a communication hub called Geth, which will uplink you to Ethereum’s portal and co-ordinate the hardware with your setup. You also need to download some mining software, which will help your GPU run hashing algorithms. If you successfully mine Ether, you willreceive a block reward of 5 Ether coinsalong with part of the transaction fees. As time passes and more Ether coins are created, the block reward will mostly include transaction fees. In addition, miners will receive 1/32 rewards for every Uncle block created. You can mineLitecoinswithout spending on ASIC. You can create litecoins on CPUs that have a GPU. Miners prefer GPUs because they have higher computational power and canmake cryptographic calculationsfaster. To mine litecoins, you also need to download the appropriate software. You may find it difficult to mine litecoins on your own. In this case, you can just join a mining pool, where you can just relax and earn your rewards. In case of Litecoin, thereward reduces by half every time 840,000 blocks are mined. Currently,miners can earn 25 litecoins for every blockthey create and this reward halves after a particular number of blocks are created. Dash is one of the newest kinds on block. It is an anonymous coin that currently enjoysa market cap of over $1 billion. EachDash coin is today worthmore than $200. It works on the principles of proof of work and the blockchain technology. Dash recommends ASIC processors for mining its coins, but miners can still use their CPUs and GPUs for mining Dash coins. Detailed mining guides are available on the Dash website. Going through those guides will help you find a faster hashrate on your CPU. If you are into GPU mining, you have to download appropriate software such asDashMiner,MinerGate, andSGMiner. You also need to install a wallet to store all your Dash coins. You can make things easier for you by just joining a mining pool as it will greatly increase your chances of earning rewards. Dash blocks are hard to generate as they useX11 algorithms. If thehashrate is 385 Mh/s, you will get 1.8 Dash coins per blockgenerated. Monero is a cryptocurrency that is based on the Cryptonote algorithm. It features ring signatures to make transactions more private. You have to use CPUs and GPUs to mine Monero coins asno ASIC equipment has been created for Monero so far. You must use AMD graphic cards although NVidia GPUs work just as well. You also need to use appropriate software such as the CryptoCompare-recommended Wolf’s Cryptonote Open Source CPU Miner. It has an AMD GPU version for those using AMD GPU, calledWolf’s Cryptonote Open Source AMD GPU Miner. The next step is to configure your software to make it work with the hardware, install a Monero wallet, join a cryptocurrency mining pool, and collect your rewards. In case of Monero, block rewardsdecrease slowly till they become 0.3 XMR/minute. After this, the reward will remain the same for an indefinite period of time. Is there really a pot of gold at the end of the cryptocurrency rainbow?Paco Ahlgrenof the Wi-Fi Alliance calls cryptocurrencies “the purest form of democracy the world has ever known”. Digital coins are definitely revolutionizing the world, especially as you can earn coins for all your hard work and investment. Still, the industry is quite young. If you take up cryptocurrency mining as your hobby, you can generate a few dollars every day. If you stick to mining for up to two years, you may recover the amount you invested in the hardware. In fact, you have to invest more in hardware if you want to earn more coins. If you want to earn an income out of cryptocurrencies, you will make more profits out of cryptocurrency trading than in cryptocurrency mining. The idea is to buy cryptocurrencies and store them in wallets so that you can sell them when their value increases. Miners, on the other hand, have a tougher time keeping electricity costs down. Your profits as a miner depend on the following factors: If you want to mine cryptocurrencies or even trade in them, make sure that you invest money that you can afford to lose. You should also remember to do a lot of research on various coins because themarket is flooded with scam coins.      © 2024CoinTrust.com. * DISCLAIMER: All information provided in CoinTrust is merely for informational purposes, we are not an investment advisor and not affiliated with any companies or ICO/Cryptocurrency Projects.

    "news_title": "Central Bank of Saudi Arabia Teams Up with Ripple to Transform Cross-Border Settlements",
    "news_content": "In a significant development, the Central Bank of Saudi Arabia has unveiled a strategic partnership with Ripple, a renowned blockchain firm, aimed at revolutionizing cross-border settlements. This move underscores the bank’s commitment to enhancing its financial infrastructure through cutting-edge technology. The Central Bank of Saudi Arabia’s recognition of Ripple as a partner for cross-border settlements highlights the increasing importance of innovative solutions in the global financial landscape. RippleNet, a decentralized global payments network, will play a pivotal role in facilitating seamless cross-border transactions. The utilization of the cryptocurrency XRP for swift payment settlement adds an extra layer of efficiency and speed to the process. An intriguing disclosure emerged on social media, revealing that the Central Bank of the U.A.E. is actively exploring blockchain protocols for interbank payments. In the process of evaluation, certain blockchain platforms were excluded due to their inherent limitations. Notably, public blockchains like Ripple and Stellar were sidelined due to their lack of necessary permissions and privacy features. The shortlist of potential contenders comprises R3 Corda, Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), and JPMC Quorum, all of which exhibit promising attributes for the envisioned use case. Recalling events from 2018, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) inked a historic agreement with Ripple, signaling a paradigm shift in the realm of central banking. The collaboration initiated a pioneering pilot program, positioning SAMA as the world’s first central bank to embark on such a groundbreaking initiative. Through the adoption of Ripple’s ‘xCurrent’ software, Saudi banks participating in the program will be able to achieve instantaneous settlement of both inbound and outbound payments. This innovation holds the potential to redefine global money transfers by drastically reducing settlement times.  The decision of SAMA to adopt Ripple’s xCurrent solution marks a significant stride toward embracing the transformative capabilities of blockchain technology. This aligns with a broader trend observed among financial institutions that are increasingly recognizing the potential of blockchain in revolutionizing payment systems. Dilip Rao, Ripple’s Global Head of Infrastructure Innovation, lauded SAMA’s forward-looking approach and highlighted the inherent benefits of blockchain technology. He emphasized that this technology has the power to dismantle barriers in trade and commerce, thereby fostering growth opportunities for businesses and offering enhanced experiences for consumers.  Ripple is not partnered with Amazon. The ‘breaking news’ circulating is a Ripple case study in AWS (cloud computing/api’s) (subsidiary of Amazon proper) and is over three years old, references old product suite (via/current/rapid) Amazon has never stated they will use$XRPpic.twitter.com/f5EYNlV8Gk — King Solomon (@IOV_OWL)August 15, 2023  Amidst these dynamic developments, a tweet by Genfinityio CEO King Solomon dispelled the rumors surrounding a supposed partnership between Ripple and Amazon. Clarifying the situation, the tweet indicated that the news circulating was misconstrued, as it merely presented a case study involving Amazon Web Services (AWS). King Solomon’s tweet emphasized that the case study was over three years old and referred to outdated product suites. The distinction was critical to understand, as AWS, a subsidiary of Amazon, is actively engaged in a wide array of blockchain integrations that are separate from the misleading narrative. King Solomon’s tweet served to highlight the potential pitfalls of sensationalist reporting prevalent in certain crypto news outlets. The misleading headlines lacked the necessary depth and context to substantiate the claims. This instance underscores the importance of discerning news sources and exercising caution while consuming information, especially in the digital age where misinformation can spread rapidly. In conclusion, the collaboration between the Central Bank of Saudi Arabia and Ripple holds promising prospects for reshaping cross-border settlements. This alliance not only signifies the bank’s commitment to innovation but also underscores the role of technology in transforming traditional financial systems. Simultaneously, the clarification surrounding the Amazon-related rumors highlights the necessity of critical thinking and careful consideration when engaging with news in the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

    "news_title": "HSBC Targets Metaverse Investments with New Fund for Wealthy Clients",
    "news_content": "HSBC Holdings has introduced a fund specifically designed to seize investment opportunities in the metaverse for its affluent clients in Hong Kong and Singapore. This move aligns with the growing trend of financial services companies tapping into Silicon Valley’s burgeoning virtual reality sector. In a statement released on Wednesday, HSBC outlined that its Metaverse Discretionary Strategy portfolio, managed by its asset management division, will concentrate on investments within the metaverse ecosystem across five key segments: infrastructure, computing, virtualization, experience and discovery, and interface. This comprehensive approach aims to capture the diverse opportunities presented by the rapidly evolving metaverse landscape. Lina Lim, regional head of discretionary and funds for investments and wealth solutions in Asia Pacific at HSBC, commented on the dynamic nature of the metaverse ecosystem, emphasizing the influx of companies from various industries and sizes into this space. Lim noted that despite being in its early stages, the metaverse is witnessing rapid development, creating numerous exciting opportunities for investors. The metaverse represents a network of virtual environments accessible via multiple devices, where users can work, socialize, and play. Interest in this sector has surged since Facebook rebranded itself as Meta, signaling its strategic focus on virtual reality. HSBC’s new discretionary portfolio is tailored for high net worth and ultra-high net worth professional investors, as well as accredited investor clients in Hong Kong and Singapore. This strategic initiative reflects HSBC’s commitment to providing innovative investment solutions to its wealthiest clients. In addition to launching the new fund, HSBC announced last month its purchase of virtual real estate in an online gaming space, making it the second global bank to invest in a popular metaverse platform following JPMorgan’s establishment of a presence in the blockchain-based Decentraland. This investment is part of HSBC’s broader strategy to allocate $3.5 billion into its wealth and personal banking business. This significant investment aligns with HSBC’s ambition to become the leading wealth manager in Asia by 2025. The move to invest in the metaverse and virtual real estate is a reflection of the broader trend among global wealth managers, including UBS and Credit Suisse, who are increasing their presence in Asia. This region has seen a substantial rise in the number of billionaires and millionaires, particularly in countries like China and India. These developments underscore the competitive landscape in wealth management, with firms vying to capture the growing wealth in Asia. In conclusion, HSBC’s launch of the Metaverse Discretionary Strategy portfolio marks a significant step in its efforts to harness the potential of the metaverse for its wealthy clients. By focusing on key segments of the metaverse ecosystem and making strategic investments in virtual real estate, HSBC is positioning itself at the forefront of this emerging sector. The bank’s commitment to investing in its wealth and personal banking business further highlights its ambition to lead the wealth management industry in Asia, capitalizing on the region’s rapidly increasing affluence.

    "news_title": "Avoiding Delays in Processing Cryptocurrency Sell Orders - CoinTrust",
    "news_content": "If you do have any quantity of any digital currencies then the fastest and most convenient way for you to sell your holdings is by making use of a digital currency exchange, however what many people have been complaining about is there being some very long delays in their sell orders being processed at many different digital currency exchanges. What you will find is that if the value of any digital currency does start to suddenly drop in value, then a lot of people will be spooked by that fall in the value of their digital currency holdings and will panic and want to sell their holdings. As such that then causes many digital currency exchanges to get completely overwhelmed with sell orders, and in some cases quite a number of them have crashed, and have gone offline for minutes or even hours. One thing to keep in mind also is that there does of course need to be buyers willing to buy any digital currencies people want to sell, and under a normal trading environment matching a buyer and seller is relatively simple and those transactions are performed very quickly. But if there has been a mad panic by a huge number of people trying to sell their digital currencies those transactions can only be processed when buyers are found on the exchange you are using so just be aware that at times there can be delays when selling any digital currencies as it is all about supply and demand! It is always going to be a difficult decision for you tosell on your Bitcoin holdings, much more so if they have been showing a sharp increase in their value, and that does of course go for all other digital currencies too. You may end up selling them n and locking in a huge profit, and that is certainly what a lot of people have done, but then you discover that if you have continued to hold onto them you would have made more money! https://youtu.be/LIQem2N7XXc However, it is going to be up to you and your decision alone as towhen you should sell any Bitcoinholdings, and with that in mind I would encourage you to wait until you are happy to sell them but then look around for ways that will see you not losing any additional value but having to pay huge fees and charges. With that in mind possibly consider notselling your digital currency holdingsat a digital currency exchange, but by doing a peer to peer transaction with someone you know and trust as you will save a small fortune in fees and charges by doing so. You will also find it is possible to walk up to a Bitcoin ATM if that is the digital currency you have holdings of that you wish to sell and can sell them on the sport for local currency! But then again there will be fees and charges associated with you using a Bitcoin ATM so factor them into the equation too! There can be times when many people will be spooked to sell their cryptocurrency holdings, and one time that is going to become very apparent if a cryptocurrency suddenly drops in value, as many people will think there is crash or bubble burst occurring and they will want to get out quick! However, if you have been watching the digital currency environment for any amount of time then you will have quickly realised that the price of all digital currencies do seem to correct themselves and start to rise again not long after they have suddenly dropped in value. As such you will rarely see any experience and savvy digital currency users selling their holdings when the price of any of them drop instead they are much more likely to start buying digital currencies when that happens. So, if you are about to venture into the digital currency environment for the very first time, then please keep a cool levels head and always look at investing in digital currencies as a long term rather than a much short term investment, as that way you are much more likely to see your digital assets grow in value!

    "news_title": "Can Digital Currencies Ever Be Regulated? - CoinTrust",
    "news_content": "It often surprises first time digital currency users that the environment within that innovative industry is a completely unregulated one however that fact can often be enough to put off a lot of people from ever choosing to use any type of digital currencies of course! The thing to keep in mind however with blockchain and the way in which all cryptocurrencies have been designed is such that it is a highly secure system for moving money around with a lot of safeguards in place to ensure no counterfeit coins can ever be put into the system. Unlike fiat currencies where there is always going to be the very real risk you could be given a counterfeit coin or banknote, that is something that is impossible to do with all digital currencies due to the checks and double checks performed on the ledger of each of them. As such one thing to be aware of is that digital currencies and the entire structure of them are much more secure and safe than nay fiat currencies, however it is the value of digital currencies and the volatility of those values that many people to find hard to fathom out and get their heads around! As digital currencies are not backed by any Government, any precious method or in fact anything, then it is impossible for anyone to have a system in palace whereby they can be regulated, as they have been designed to be completely anonymous currencies and ones that anyone can use for any purpose they wish to use them for. There are no restrictions in place in regards tohow can use any digital currencyand as such if you do wish to make use of any of them to move money around anonymously and in a highly secure way then you are always going to be free to do just that. What you are going to have to ensure you have are all of the required things in palace to allow you to buy and store you digital currencies. As such you are going to have to get yourself a digital currency as that is where you are going to be able tomove your digital currencies aroundand will use that wallet to send digital currencies where you wish to send them or to receive any digital currencies you have bought or people are sending you for whatever purpose. It is also important that you dofind a digital currency exchange, which is where you buy and sell all digital currencies that are going to be offering you reasonable fees, for there can be some very high fees associated with using many different digital wallets that can and do very quickly add up! I did very recently read with great interest that the Bank of England decided to commission a report into whether it would be both feasible and practical for them to launch a digital currency of their own, but one that forms part of the GBP fiat currency! The very fact that a major and very well respected national bank has been looking into the practicalities of launching their own digital currency is interesting, for there is one thing those banks are always eager to do and that is to cut costs. The cost of running a digital currency is of course minimal as are the day to day costs for users of those digital currencies but they do of course offer very high levels of security which is something many bans are going to be very interested in. Obviously it is far too early to tell if the Bank of England or for that matter any other banking institution is going to eventually one day launch their own digital currencies, but above all else it does prove that digital currencies are becoming respected and they are high safe and secure peer to peer money transfer systems. But one thing I can imagine when and if any national bank or country does launch their own digital currencies and that is there will still more people using those that have no connection with any bank or government, as that was the whole idea of them being launched in the very first place. I will of course let you know how this story rumbles on, but I am fairly confident it is going to be years if not decades before any country of the world does finally get around to launching a digital currency.

    "news_title": "Chainlink Unveils CRE: Boosting Blockchain Scalability and Customization",
    "news_content": "Chainlink has introduced a transformative upgrade called the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), a new platform designed to scale operations across thousands of blockchain networks while providing developers with flexible and customizable workflows. The update, shared through Chainlink’s official X account, represents a step forward in modular blockchain design by breaking down essential oracle functions into adaptable components, allowing developers to create more specialized workflows suited to individual application requirements. The CRE offers a modular and composable architecture that enables developers to tap into Chainlink’s capabilities in unique ways. By separating the fundamental functions of an oracle network—such as blockchain reading and API calling—into distinct modules, Chainlink allows developers to integrate these functions based on their specific project needs. This architecture forms the foundation of Chainlink’s ecosystem, centralizing its capabilities in a way that allows for innovative workflows triggered by decentralized oracle networks (DONs) to securely facilitate interactions across various blockchain environments. An especially appealing aspect of CRE is its support for self-serve product development. Through this upgrade, developers can design applications and processes on the platform without needing to embed specialized Chainlink code into core blockchain computations. This makes cross-blockchain communication and transactions easier for developers to implement and enhances the platform’s usability, particularly for teams seeking a more seamless way to manage cross-chain data flows and interactions. In addition to fostering more customized development, CRE’s architecture accommodates programmatic workflows, which can be adjusted for specific blockchain applications. The platform also supports standard programming languages and tools, along with standardized cross-chain components, making it more accessible for a broader audience of developers. This cross-chain functionality opens new avenues for applications that benefit from diverse blockchain networks while maintaining ease of interaction.  Introducing Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)—a major platform upgrade: 🔌 New modular, composable architecture⛓️ Scalable across 1000s of chains🏦 Deep customization for capital markets users🏗️ Self-serve product development 🧵⬇️https://t.co/BE807PgfB2 — Chainlink (@chainlink)October 30, 2024  To protect the user experience, Chainlink has structured the CRE upgrade as a phased rollout. This staggered approach will help the platform maintain continuity for current users throughout the transition. In the initial phase, Chainlink will focus on migrating key services such as the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to the CRE foundation. This move is expected to strengthen Chainlink’s cross-chain infrastructure, allowing for more seamless scalability as additional blockchains are integrated. As part of this upgrade, Chainlink has also introduced new blockchain integrations, including support for the Aptos blockchain. This enhanced architecture allows financial institutions to connect their existing systems with blockchain-based workflows, such as Delivery vs. Payment (DvP). By joining the early access program for CRE, users interested in exploring workflow creation on this platform can contribute to Chainlink’s growing network of cross-chain applications. The CRE upgrade thus not only benefits current users but also extends Chainlink’s reach into sectors looking for advanced interoperability solutions. Chainlink’s introduction of CRE is a significant leap forward for both the platform and its users. By providing a flexible, modular environment that facilitates blockchain interactions across various networks, CRE underscores Chainlink’s commitment to scalability and innovation within the blockchain space. This update, with its emphasis on modular design and cross-chain capabilities, positions Chainlink as a leading solution for developers seeking interoperability without compromising on customization or security. Ultimately, the Chainlink Runtime Environment stands as a promising development in blockchain technology, allowing developers to build applications that cater to diverse, decentralized workflows while simplifying the complexities of cross-chain data exchange. Through CRE, Chainlink continues to evolve as a platform that enables not only decentralized finance but also a broader ecosystem of blockchain-powered applications tailored to specific business and industry requirements.

    "news_title": "Cheapest Ways to Buy Bitcoin Online - CoinTrust",
    "news_content": "Keeping the dreaded transaction fees and often all of the additional processing fees when you wish to buy any quantity or unit of Bitcoin or for that matter any digital currencies as low as possible is critical, for if you just sign up to any exchange you could be paying way too much! With that in mind please do read through today’s news story for I will be showing you several different ways that you can keep your costs down. Obviously the digital currency exchange you choose to make use of is always going to have their own fees and charges, so always select one with the lowest fees! Getting a clear understanding of those fees and charges can however be difficult if you have never place an order to by Bitcoin or any other digital currency. So, first and foremost do keep in mind that there are always going to be movement fees when buying Bitcoin, and as such you want to select a digital currency exchange that has the lowest movement fees. Also the payment method you choose to pay for your digital currency is also an important factor, for if you use for example a credit card to buy your Bitcoin with then you may find the fees and charges associated with doing so are higher than if you use a debit card! So always take a look at the fees and costs pages that you will find displayed at all digital currency exchanges and try and select a payment method with the very lowest fees associated with them. It is not only going to be the rather fee hungry digital currency exchanges that you are going to be able to buy Bitcoin from, for there are plenty of other ways you can make a purchase of any quantity of the cryptocurrency you wish to buy. One of the ways it was of course designed for was to perform peer to peer transactions and as such if you know someone who wishes to sell Bitcoin and you want to buy some then do a transaction with those people, as you could and probably will save a small fortune in fees when you do so. https://youtu.be/A8zdpnC8L-g There is in fact a service offered by Local Bitcoin and when you make use of their site they will match you up with someone close by where you live who wants to sell Bitcoin or buy Bitcoin and as such you could use their services to find someone to do peer to peer transactions with! You may also find by doing such a transaction you can lock in and agreed price that you will have to pay for your Bitcoin, instead of having to rely on the spot rate that a digital currency exchange will offer you at the time they sell it to you! If you are lucky enough to live nearby a Bitcoin ATM then you are of course going to be able to use one of those machines tobuy Bitcoin on the spot, and I do have to say I have found them to be quite popular, and that does of course mean the number of Bitcoin ATM’s are going to constantly increase in number of people are using them! But at the end of the day a Bitcoin ATM is of course there to make money for the operator and supplier of those machines, and as such there are still going to befees and chargesthat you will have to pay when buying or even selling Bitcoin through such a machine. It has also been found that much likedigital currency exchangeswhen the price of Bitcoin does for example crashes in price and there is something of a mad panic to sell Bitcoin those machines can go offline for a certain amount of time. However, if you do wish to buy Bitcoin then you are never going to have any difficulties finding somewhere to buy them from, which cannot be said when you wish to sell Bitcoin as there have been many times when there are some very long delays in you putting in a sell order to sell Bitcoin and the amount of time a digital currency exchange will take to process those orders.

    "news_title": "Morph Launches on Ethereum, Targeting Mass Blockchain Adoption",
    "news_content": "Morph, a globally recognized platform for advancing blockchain adoption, has officially launched its mainnet on Ethereum, a significant development in its journey toward creating a blockchain experience that is accessible to mainstream users. The launch of the Morph mainnet introduces a consumer layer designed to overcome common adoption barriers by enabling participants to trade real assets and engage in various blockchain transactions. With the mainnet now live, projects already developed on Morph can seamlessly transition to this broader ecosystem, potentially increasing user engagement and accelerating the platform’s consumer-focused growth. CEO and co-founder Cecilia Hsueh emphasized that this mainnet launch is a major achievement in Morph’s goal to bring blockchain technology to a broad audience. She indicated that most decentralized applications (DApps) are currently inaccessible to everyday users and stated that Morph’s objective is to bridge this gap by providing a decentralized, scalable, and secure infrastructure. This will enable developers to create the next generation of user-friendly DApps and offer non-crypto natives the opportunity to interact easily within the blockchain ecosystem. Morph’s consumer layer is a comprehensive environment combining advanced blockchain technologies, such as optimistic and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, which improve both security and scalability. The solution is crafted to address longstanding issues in blockchain, including regulatory restrictions, scalability limitations, and performance challenges. With these improvements, Morph is striving to make blockchain accessible to a wider user base by offering builders an experience that prioritizes scalability, security, and simplicity. Morph’s mainnet debut builds on the successes of its earlier Holesky testnet, which featured several key upgrades that have been integrated into the mainnet. One notable advancement was the EIP-4844 Optimistic zkVM integration, a feature that reduces transaction costs and offers an updated bridge mechanism allowing for single-transaction withdrawals. During the testnet phase, Morph recorded substantial engagement, with over six million wallet addresses, more than 100 million transactions, 200 projects deployed, and over one million community members. This high level of activity highlights the network’s appeal to developers and users alike and lays a strong foundation for further adoption on the mainnet. COO and co-founder Azeem Khan highlighted that Morph’s goal is to be a comprehensive resource for global builders, providing them with tools to help them achieve success in launching and scaling their blockchain projects. He pointed out that while decentralization is critical, builders face challenges in finding the resources needed for successful project development, launch, and expansion. Morph aims to address this gap by creating an environment tailored to the needs of builders, thereby facilitating a more accessible path to blockchain success. Morph distinguishes itself from other blockchain platforms by prioritizing a consumer-focused approach rather than remaining limited to purely technical features. This consumer layer strategy involves offering critical resources to builders, including funding, incubation, acceleration, and market strategies, all aimed at fostering a user-first approach to blockchain development. Among its initiatives, Morph recently launched the Centralized Exchange Coalition, which includes several leading centralized exchanges, to empower builders with the tools necessary to bring projects to market, attract new users, and secure essential funding. Through these supportive measures, Morph seeks to position itself as a significant driver of blockchain innovation and adoption, facilitating a new wave of user-friendly applications that can appeal to a broad audience. This support system aligns with Morph’s overarching vision of transforming the blockchain industry from a niche technological space to an accessible mainstream utility. By equipping builders with the necessary resources, Morph aims to generate a broad ecosystem of applications that meet diverse user needs and contribute to increased blockchain adoption. Morph operates as a global consumer layer, serving as a distribution hub that provides builders with the resources needed to launch and scale their projects for the mass market. Through the use of hybrid rollup technology, combining ZK and Optimistic rollups, and employing a decentralized sequencer, Morph opens up limitless possibilities for developers targeting a mainstream audience. This unique blend of technology allows Morph to offer a user-friendly experience for developers who seek to create accessible and secure blockchain applications. As one of Morph’s original investors, Bitget, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, will continue to play a role in supporting the Morph ecosystem and contributing to its growth. With these strategic partnerships and innovative technologies, Morph is positioned to make a significant impact on the blockchain industry by paving the way for consumer-friendly, scalable applications that cater to everyday users. By emphasizing accessibility, resource support, and advanced technology, Morph aims to transform the blockchain landscape and drive a new era of blockchain adoption for all.

    "news_title": "Instruxi Launches Mesh ID to Simplify Secure Access to Tokenized Assets",
    "news_content": "Instruxi, an emerging decentralized data management platform, has introduced Mesh ID, its latest Web3 solution aimed at revolutionizing access to tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) for over 22 million U.S. residents. This innovative tool is designed to simplify identity verification processes, enhance data privacy, and improve user accessibility to blockchain-based financial products in a way that aligns with regulatory requirements. Instruxi has collaborated with prominent industry players, including Chainlink, CLEAR, and Space and Time, to launch the Mesh ID solution as the initial module of its RWA platform. This collaboration, announced via a recent press release, leverages each partner’s strengths to optimize identity verification and provide robust data security for blockchain applications. Mesh ID integrates with CLEAR’s advanced API, enabling streamlined know-your-customer (KYC) processing without compromising user privacy or security. With CLEAR’s established track record of serving over 25 million users, Instruxi’s solution stands to benefit from a reputable, tier-one identity verification system. The Instruxi-CLEAR partnership facilitates faster pre-approval and minimizes KYC processing times, ultimately making on-chain financial products more accessible to U.S.-based users while ensuring regulatory compliance. In addition to CLEAR, Chainlink brings substantial value to Instruxi’s platform. As a leading decentralized computing platform, Chainlink supports Mesh ID’s seamless integration with enterprise systems, offering both on-chain and off-chain security assurances. Chainlink’s extensive suite of Oracle services has been pivotal in enabling secure data interactions, a key factor in asset tokenization’s projected $867 trillion market potential. Instruxi employs Chainlink Functions to enable access to real-world data via APIs and utilizes Chainlink Automation to ensure efficient, scalable operations within a decentralized framework. Further strengthening Mesh ID’s infrastructure, Instruxi has collaborated with Space and Time, a decentralized data warehouse for blockchain applications. Space and Time’s zero-knowledge database enables users to verify elements of their data and identity without exposing sensitive details on-chain. This feature enhances security while facilitating privacy-conscious access to RWAs, aligning with Instruxi’s mission to uphold data confidentiality as a cornerstone of its offerings. Austin Przybysz, Instruxi’s Co-Founder and Solutions Architect, highlighted the importance of the Mesh ID beta release, noting that this collaboration integrates KYC and identity verification within Instruxi Data Mesh to enable universal policy enforcement capabilities across the platform. He underscored the significance of combining high standards of user security with regulatory compliance to broaden accessibility to tokenized assets in a seamless, compliant manner. With the launch of Mesh ID, Instruxi is positioning itself at the forefront of asset tokenization, starting with tokenized real estate assets for its closed beta users. As the platform moves toward its full release, the company plans to expand its asset offerings to include additional classes, aligning with its goal to make a broad range of tokenized RWAs available through a user-centric, decentralized platform. Real-World Assets, or RWAs, refer to digital tokens that represent traditional financial assets, including cash, securities, commodities, and real estate, on the blockchain. By converting these assets into blockchain-based tokens, users gain new benefits such as fractional ownership, programmability, enhanced liquidity, transparency, and improved risk management.

    "news_title": "Ethereum Wallets Surge in Popularity as Plus Wallet Redefines User Experience",
    "news_content": "Ethereum has been witnessing unprecedented growth, with wallets now collectively holding over 19 million ETH. Projections suggest this number could exceed 20 million by year’s end, marking a significant milestone that reflects a rising interest in cryptocurrency among prominent economic players. This surge in Ethereum holdings underscores the increasing role of digital assets in mainstream financial markets and has drawn attention to the critical role of secure, feature-rich wallets. Throughout 2024, Ethereum wallet usage has experienced substantial growth, with the total amount of ETH held rising from 11.5 million at the beginning of the year to over 19 million by mid-October. Valued at approximately $2,700 per ETH, these holdings are currently worth close to $80 billion, a figure comparable to the market capitalizations of some leading global corporations. Industry observers attribute part of this growth to the recent approval of Ethereum spot ETFs, which has boosted investor confidence and helped cement Ethereum’s place as a key financial asset. As the value and prevalence of digital assets grow, so does the demand for wallets that provide more than just storage. Emerging platforms like Plus Wallet are responding by offering a suite of functionalities designed to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. In addition to multi-chain accessibility, Plus Wallet provides robust security features and dual rewards programs, making it a popular choice for those navigating the expanding cryptocurrency landscape. Amid the increased focus on Ethereum, another notable development comes from Ctrl Wallet, which is enhancing its operational framework by migrating its $XDEFI token to $CTRL. This transition aims to improve token liquidity and optimize the wallet’s token structure for a more seamless user experience. Holders of $XDEFI and $vXDEFI on Ethereum and Arbitrum are encouraged to exchange their tokens for $CTRL at a one-to-one ratio through a dedicated migration portal, with fees waived until the end of 2024. Leading exchanges, including KuCoin and Huobi, are supporting this transition, and 32% of the total $CTRL token supply will be secured in liquidity pools for the next twelve months. This move toward a deflationary token model reflects a strategic approach to preserving the token’s value over time, highlighting Ctrl Wallet’s commitment to robust, long-term token economics. The rapid expansion of the cryptocurrency market, especially within the Web3 sector, has fueled demand for versatile wallets that offer flexibility and adaptability to cater to emerging opportunities. Traditional wallets often limit users to a single network, restricting their trading and exploration capabilities. However, Plus Wallet has set itself apart by addressing these limitations with a cross-chain functionality, enabling users to manage and trade assets across various blockchain networks from one interface. This feature not only simplifies the trading process but also enables users to engage with a broader range of assets and access new projects at early stages. In addition to cross-chain access, Plus Wallet incorporates unique rewards features aimed at boosting user satisfaction. The platform’s “Swap to Earn” functionality rewards users with every trading transaction, providing a straightforward means of increasing their earnings without requiring additional effort. Combined with stringent security measures like advanced encryption and two-factor authentication, Plus Wallet ensures that users can manage their assets securely while benefiting from consistent, user-driven rewards. The heightened interest in Ethereum among large-scale economic entities and mainstream stakeholders highlights the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in the financial landscape. This growing demand has catalyzed the development of more advanced wallet solutions that cater to the market’s diverse and sophisticated requirements. By equipping users with multi-functional wallets that prioritize security, flexibility, and financial empowerment, platforms like Plus Wallet are establishing themselves as essential tools for navigating the expanding Web3 environment. While Ctrl Wallet’s migration from $XDEFI to $CTRL demonstrates a strategic focus on liquidity and user experience, Plus Wallet is positioning itself as a comprehensive solution for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. With its multi-chain capabilities, robust security features, and user rewards, Plus Wallet aims to provide the level of control and flexibility required to capitalize on new opportunities in the Web3 space. The wallet’s blend of security and versatility makes it a leading choice for users seeking both functionality and protection in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies and Ethereum wallets grows, the need for user-centric platforms becomes more apparent. By addressing security concerns, enhancing trading accessibility, and fostering user engagement, wallets like Plus Wallet are helping to shape the future of digital asset management, offering users the tools to navigate the rapidly evolving financial landscape with confidence.

    "news_title": "Deadfellaz and Skale Labs Partner for Gas-Free NFT Trading Card Game Launch",
    "news_content": "In a strategic step towards mainstream adoption of blockchain gaming, Skale Labs has collaborated with DFZ Labs, the creative force behind the successful Deadfellaz NFT collection, to introduce an innovative trading card game (TCG) called Death Touch. Expected to launch in the first quarter of 2025, this new game will be accessible on mobile devices, positioning it to attract a broad range of users and serve as an entry point for a more mainstream audience into blockchain gaming. The Deadfellaz NFT collection originally debuted on Ethereum in August 2021, crafted by co-founders Psych and Betty, and quickly gained traction due to its unique themes and early endorsement by high-profile figures, including Reese Witherspoon, Steve Aoki, Bill Murray, and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. The collection’s rise in popularity underscored the appeal of digital collectibles with strong community elements, which the founders are now extending into a mobile trading card game format. Skale Labs, known for its scalable, gas-free blockchain solutions, currently supports a network of over 150 games in various development stages within its ecosystem. The recent partnership with DFZ Labs builds upon this base by leveraging Skale’s infrastructure to optimize Death Touch for accessibility and performance. As a gas-free Ethereum scaling solution, Skale’s blockchain facilitates more user-friendly experiences, which are crucial for attracting casual and competitive gamers alike. This partnership also reflects Skale’s broader strategic objectives, following a recent collaboration with gaming pioneer Nolan Bushnell—founder of Atari—whose gaming tournament platform, Moxy, is set to integrate with Skale’s infrastructure. According to Andrew Saunders, Chief Marketing and Growth Officer at Skale Labs, integrating the Deadfellaz franchise within the Skale ecosystem aligns with Skale’s mission to prioritize consumer-friendly applications of blockchain. He expressed his enthusiasm for seeing blockchain gaming projects like Deadfellaz actively working toward broader consumer adoption. Saunders highlighted the growth potential in a gaming landscape that he sees as evolving toward greater consumer focus rather than being purely brand-driven. He further noted that having followed Deadfellaz closely since its inception, he felt optimistic about their expansion into new gaming genres.  The Horde rises from the shadows…gas-free! 🧟♀️@Deadfellazis conjuring their TCG game, Death Touch, on SKALE, summoning a seamless, gas-free gaming experience from the underworld. 🎮 Learn more about the upcoming launch:https://t.co/ut1Hn2WuMepic.twitter.com/JjmLPgZzcp — SKALE (@SkaleNetwork)October 29, 2024  Psych, co-founder of Deadfellaz, outlined the team’s ambitions for Death Touch as an evolution of the interactive and gamified storytelling that has characterized Deadfellaz’s journey so far. By building a mobile-first title that embraces the trading card game genre, DFZ Labs aims to offer a more dynamic and engaging experience for fans seeking fresh interactions within the TCG space. He emphasized that partnering with Skale would enable Death Touch to grow as a free-to-play title, providing a seamless experience for both Web3 gamers and traditional gamers. The gas-free structure of Skale’s blockchain, he noted, allows them to reach a wider demographic, including competitive players and casual users who may be new to blockchain-based games. The collaboration between Skale Labs and DFZ Labs is set against a larger trend of integrating blockchain technology within the gaming industry. With projects like Death Touch, these partnerships are moving closer to offering scalable, user-friendly platforms for gaming experiences that combine digital collectibles with gameplay. By addressing key pain points such as transaction fees, Skale’s gas-free blockchain approach makes it easier for developers to target a mainstream audience, potentially bridging the gap between blockchain gaming enthusiasts and traditional gaming communities. Through the creation of this new TCG, Skale Labs and DFZ Labs are not only building upon the Deadfellaz brand but are also aiming to redefine user interaction within Web3 applications. This partnership signals a step towards making blockchain gaming more accessible and engaging, ensuring players experience the benefits of blockchain without the common obstacles associated with it. With the anticipated launch of Death Touch, Skale Labs and DFZ Labs appear poised to bring blockchain gaming to an even broader market, pushing the boundaries of interactive digital experiences and setting a new precedent for community-driven gaming in the Web3 space.

    "news_title": "Deadfellaz and Skale Labs Partner for Gas-Free NFT Trading Card Game Launch",
    "news_content": "In a strategic step towards mainstream adoption of blockchain gaming, Skale Labs has collaborated with DFZ Labs, the creative force behind the successful Deadfellaz NFT collection, to introduce an innovative trading card game (TCG) called Death Touch. Expected to launch in the first quarter of 2025, this new game will be accessible on mobile devices, positioning it to attract a broad range of users and serve as an entry point for a more mainstream audience into blockchain gaming. The Deadfellaz NFT collection originally debuted on Ethereum in August 2021, crafted by co-founders Psych and Betty, and quickly gained traction due to its unique themes and early endorsement by high-profile figures, including Reese Witherspoon, Steve Aoki, Bill Murray, and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. The collection’s rise in popularity underscored the appeal of digital collectibles with strong community elements, which the founders are now extending into a mobile trading card game format. Skale Labs, known for its scalable, gas-free blockchain solutions, currently supports a network of over 150 games in various development stages within its ecosystem. The recent partnership with DFZ Labs builds upon this base by leveraging Skale’s infrastructure to optimize Death Touch for accessibility and performance. As a gas-free Ethereum scaling solution, Skale’s blockchain facilitates more user-friendly experiences, which are crucial for attracting casual and competitive gamers alike. This partnership also reflects Skale’s broader strategic objectives, following a recent collaboration with gaming pioneer Nolan Bushnell—founder of Atari—whose gaming tournament platform, Moxy, is set to integrate with Skale’s infrastructure. According to Andrew Saunders, Chief Marketing and Growth Officer at Skale Labs, integrating the Deadfellaz franchise within the Skale ecosystem aligns with Skale’s mission to prioritize consumer-friendly applications of blockchain. He expressed his enthusiasm for seeing blockchain gaming projects like Deadfellaz actively working toward broader consumer adoption. Saunders highlighted the growth potential in a gaming landscape that he sees as evolving toward greater consumer focus rather than being purely brand-driven. He further noted that having followed Deadfellaz closely since its inception, he felt optimistic about their expansion into new gaming genres.  The Horde rises from the shadows…gas-free! 🧟♀️@Deadfellazis conjuring their TCG game, Death Touch, on SKALE, summoning a seamless, gas-free gaming experience from the underworld. 🎮 Learn more about the upcoming launch:https://t.co/ut1Hn2WuMepic.twitter.com/JjmLPgZzcp — SKALE (@SkaleNetwork)October 29, 2024  Psych, co-founder of Deadfellaz, outlined the team’s ambitions for Death Touch as an evolution of the interactive and gamified storytelling that has characterized Deadfellaz’s journey so far. By building a mobile-first title that embraces the trading card game genre, DFZ Labs aims to offer a more dynamic and engaging experience for fans seeking fresh interactions within the TCG space. He emphasized that partnering with Skale would enable Death Touch to grow as a free-to-play title, providing a seamless experience for both Web3 gamers and traditional gamers. The gas-free structure of Skale’s blockchain, he noted, allows them to reach a wider demographic, including competitive players and casual users who may be new to blockchain-based games. The collaboration between Skale Labs and DFZ Labs is set against a larger trend of integrating blockchain technology within the gaming industry. With projects like Death Touch, these partnerships are moving closer to offering scalable, user-friendly platforms for gaming experiences that combine digital collectibles with gameplay. By addressing key pain points such as transaction fees, Skale’s gas-free blockchain approach makes it easier for developers to target a mainstream audience, potentially bridging the gap between blockchain gaming enthusiasts and traditional gaming communities. Through the creation of this new TCG, Skale Labs and DFZ Labs are not only building upon the Deadfellaz brand but are also aiming to redefine user interaction within Web3 applications. This partnership signals a step towards making blockchain gaming more accessible and engaging, ensuring players experience the benefits of blockchain without the common obstacles associated with it. With the anticipated launch of Death Touch, Skale Labs and DFZ Labs appear poised to bring blockchain gaming to an even broader market, pushing the boundaries of interactive digital experiences and setting a new precedent for community-driven gaming in the Web3 space.

    "news_title": "Ubisoft Quietly Launches Blockchain Game Champions Tactics",
    "news_content": "Ubisoft, a prominent player in the gaming industry, has officially entered the blockchain arena with the release of its first blockchain-based game, Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles. This new title introduces a tactical, turn-based experience incorporating NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as key in-game assets. Initially announced by the company in June, Champions Tactics represents a significant development following Ubisoft’s ongoing blockchain experimentation, yet the release itself was relatively low-profile. Available for PC, the game is free to start, though players have the option to purchase NFT figurines—digital assets with unique attributes—using either in-game currency or cryptocurrency on an integrated marketplace. The game showcases Ubisoft’s approach to combining collectible digital items with innovative gameplay. The gameplay model in Champions Tactics focuses on turn-based battles where players face off using teams of three figurines, each with distinct characteristics. While it’s possible to participate in the game without purchasing any of these NFTs, the option is available to those willing to invest in them, with prices for these unique figurines varying widely on the marketplace from $7 to as high as $64,000. These collectible NFTs provide a significant advantage in gameplay, allowing for deeper engagement and competition among players. Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab collaborated with Oasys to design Champions Tactics with a focus on integrating blockchain in a way that enhances the gaming experience. According to Ubisoft’s Paris studio director, François Bodson, the game introduces innovative features that mirror traditional trading card games but with unique digital assets under player control. The blockchain foundation, he added, was used to create “new and innovative” gaming experiences, providing players with enhanced agency and ownership over their assets. Each NFT figurine, procedurally generated and unique in its attributes, provides strategic depth and flexibility as players can shape their assets and teams through player-driven choices. The design includes an open marketplace for players to build squads using a peer-to-peer model. During the game’s development, Ubisoft actively sought community feedback through events and beta phases, ensuring that player insights contributed to the evolution of Champions Tactics. Ubisoft intends to continue refining and expanding the game based on community engagement, as the game’s blockchain-enabled infrastructure allows for adaptability and growth. While the Adult Only rating for the game wasn’t addressed directly by Ubisoft, it is likely tied to the game’s use of blockchain elements and cryptocurrency-based transactions. In addition to its blockchain debut, Ubisoft previously ventured into the NFT space with Quartz, a dedicated NFT platform launched in December 2021. Initially, this project involved NFT offerings for Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint, but it encountered limited success, with only a small number of NFTs sold. Despite these early challenges, Ubisoft executives maintained that the potential for player-driven value in blockchain assets held promise, even though initial reception was lukewarm. Ubisoft’s dedication to blockchain persisted despite these setbacks and contrasts with the more cautious or skeptical stance other industry players have adopted toward cryptocurrency in gaming. Within the broader gaming landscape, there has been a noticeable shift in blockchain enthusiasm. Even Electronic Arts (EA), which once expressed interest in NFTs as an essential part of gaming’s future, has since stepped back, adopting a wait-and-see approach. EA’s CEO Andrew Wilson had previously highlighted the enduring appeal of collectible items in gaming, though he emphasized that NFT integration was not an immediate focus for the company. He suggested that NFT integration would only be explored further if it aligned with EA’s core mission of enhancing player experiences. Ubisoft’s release of Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles therefore stands out in the industry, as other major companies scale back on blockchain plans amid uncertain player reception. In choosing to launch Champions Tactics, Ubisoft reinforces its commitment to blockchain exploration, placing a long-term bet on digital collectibles and player-controlled assets as part of its strategy. With this title, Ubisoft aims to carve a space in the emerging field of blockchain gaming, leveraging NFTs to create unique gameplay opportunities and a player-driven economy. Whether this approach will resonate with the broader gaming community remains to be seen, but Champions Tactics marks a notable moment in Ubisoft’s digital innovation journey.

    "news_title": "G6 Networks Introduces Dual Blockchain Solution for Public and Private Sectors",
    "news_content": "G6 Networks has unveiled a dual blockchain framework designed to serve both general users and businesses, offering an adaptable solution that merges the benefits of public and private blockchain ecosystems. This approach involves two distinct components: a public chain for individual users, focusing on decentralization and digital identity, and a private chain intended for organizations with high-security needs, such as those in finance, government, and public services. The recently launched G6 Networks website provides a comprehensive look at the company’s capabilities and future objectives, highlighting upcoming developments such as the Token Fair Launch. This will be followed by the mainnet launch and Token Generation Event (TGE) slated for mid-January, bringing to life various features like decentralized storage, staking, games, and even feeless transactions. This progressive roadmap is part of G6 Networks’ commitment to empowering both individual users and enterprises with tailored blockchain applications that support secure, scalable, and flexible solutions. In an effort to enhance the efficiency and security of enterprise solutions, G6 Networks’ hybrid infrastructure integrates both public and private blockchains. While the public chain is geared toward everyday users with a focus on accessibility and digital identity, the private chain has been designed to meet the specific needs of institutions requiring a permissioned and customizable platform. This structure is ideal for enterprises where data security and scalability are paramount. Examples of sectors benefiting from this private blockchain ecosystem include financial services, government operations, and public sector entities. Additionally, G6 Networks has incorporated an advanced security layer into this infrastructure, which includes a distributed hardware storage system that ensures data resilience and maintains information integrity. One of the standout features of G6 Networks’ architecture is interoperability, a capability that facilitates interaction between different private chains—a rare functionality in blockchain platforms.

    "news_title": "Square’s Patent For Crypto Payment Network Approved",
    "news_content": "Square, a leading digital payment company recently announced that it has hit another milestone. Papers recentlypublished by the US Patent & Trademark Office(USPTO) reveal that the office has formally approved of the company’s patent application for a crypto payment system. This will allow merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments from anywhere. Square filed for this patent in September 2017 and it has been close to a year for them to get the required approval. The new patent is not as revolutionary as it seems. Other payment processors likeBitPayhave allowed automatic conversion of cryptocurrencies into local currency before. The main difference is the high level of market penetration that Square has across the globe. Square is a market leaderwhen it comes to point-of-sale (POS) payments and adding cryptocurrency payments to that would be a big advantage. Merchants who already use Square would appreciate the added functionality and it would open a whole new market for cryptocurrencies. The biggest breakthrough that the patent gives to the network is its elimination of latency when it comes to bitcoin transactions. This allows for fasterbitcoin transactions– which is the main barrier to a lot of bitcoin payments. Square does this maintaining its own blockchain network that keeps a record of transactions that are then sent to the public blockchain. This transfers the risk of double spend attacks from the merchant to Square, encouraging merchants to take the risks. Another method by which transaction latency is eliminated is by having user funds held by Square, with Square updating its internal ledgers instead of referring to the external blockchain. However, a patent approval does not mean that Square will be implementing the system any time soon. Other companies have applied for crypto payment patents and have done nothing with them. For example,Bank of Americahas a number of them but the bank does not seem to be planning to use any of them. Square could be different in this regard because CEOJack Dorseyis a big fan of cryptocurrencies and he may want to push for a quick implementation. In a statement, Dorsey said The internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don’t know if it will be Bitcoin or not. I hope it will be bitcoin Dorsey also says that Square’s interest in Bitcoin goes beyond just buying and selling it. The Square Cash app already features bitcoin trading, adding a cryptocurrency payment system to the app is a good move if Square really wants to promote bitcoin usage.

    "news_title": "Square’s Patent For Crypto Payment Network Approved",
    "news_content": "Square, a leading digital payment company recently announced that it has hit another milestone. Papers recentlypublished by the US Patent & Trademark Office(USPTO) reveal that the office has formally approved of the company’s patent application for a crypto payment system. This will allow merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments from anywhere. Square filed for this patent in September 2017 and it has been close to a year for them to get the required approval. The new patent is not as revolutionary as it seems. Other payment processors likeBitPayhave allowed automatic conversion of cryptocurrencies into local currency before. The main difference is the high level of market penetration that Square has across the globe. Square is a market leaderwhen it comes to point-of-sale (POS) payments and adding cryptocurrency payments to that would be a big advantage. Merchants who already use Square would appreciate the added functionality and it would open a whole new market for cryptocurrencies. The biggest breakthrough that the patent gives to the network is its elimination of latency when it comes to bitcoin transactions. This allows for fasterbitcoin transactions– which is the main barrier to a lot of bitcoin payments. Square does this maintaining its own blockchain network that keeps a record of transactions that are then sent to the public blockchain. This transfers the risk of double spend attacks from the merchant to Square, encouraging merchants to take the risks. Another method by which transaction latency is eliminated is by having user funds held by Square, with Square updating its internal ledgers instead of referring to the external blockchain. However, a patent approval does not mean that Square will be implementing the system any time soon. Other companies have applied for crypto payment patents and have done nothing with them. For example,Bank of Americahas a number of them but the bank does not seem to be planning to use any of them. Square could be different in this regard because CEOJack Dorseyis a big fan of cryptocurrencies and he may want to push for a quick implementation. In a statement, Dorsey said The internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don’t know if it will be Bitcoin or not. I hope it will be bitcoin Dorsey also says that Square’s interest in Bitcoin goes beyond just buying and selling it. The Square Cash app already features bitcoin trading, adding a cryptocurrency payment system to the app is a good move if Square really wants to promote bitcoin usage.

    "news_title": "Japan's FSA Responds To Reports of Crypto Current Law Changes",
    "news_content": "TheFinancial Services Agency(FSA) is Japan's highest authority when it comes to financial regulation. They are in charge of everything from stocks to cryptocurrencies. This is why the FSA has come under fire recently for being lax when it comes to regulating thecryptocurrency industryin the country. The FSA has noted that criticism hurled at them and is reportedly making changes in regulation to address the cryptocurrency industry. Currently, cryptocurrencies are managed under the revised fund settlement law. The FSA has plans to change this according to reports and will look to move it under theFinancial Instruments and Exchange Act(FIEA). This currently places cryptocurrencies as means of settlement since it is considered similar to electronic money. However, if the FSA does shift to it to the FIEA, it will no longer be considered a financial product similar to stocks and bonds. This shift can make it more complicated for cryptocurrency exchanges. Under the FIEA, companies are supposed to separate company funds from customer funds and to implement stricter protection systems to ensure that everything is legal and above board. However, these reports on the changes seem to be premature. After contacting the FSA, the agency commented that there were no plans for such changes. In a statement, the FSA said If there are such considerations, it will be taken up as an agenda for the study group the said agenda has not been discussed at all in the past 4 meetings…Things that are not on the agenda at all cannot be considered The FSA refers to the regular research meeting with experts in the crypto industry, wherein important issues are brought up and discussed. However, there is still a legitimate need for a stricter cryptocurrency law. The current revised fund settlement law is what allows cryptocurrency businesses to operate in Japan, with16 exchanges registered with the FSA. But with the recent Coincheck hack, scrutiny has increased over the cryptocurrency industry and its operators. An example of this would be the recent business improvement orders sent toTech BureauandGMO Cointo improve their internal systems for better protection. This was quickly followed by an additional sixbusiness improvement ordersto licensed exchanges. This includedBitflyer, which is currently Japan's largest bitcoin exchange. Incidents like these are part of the reason why the FSA has been criticized for its approval process on licensing crypto exchanges. Many hope that stricter laws would help improve security and safety in these licensed crypto exchanges and provide better protection to Japanese investors.

    "news_title": "France’s ‘Mister Bitcoin’ Says Crypto Providers Should Be Regulated",
    "news_content": "At present,there exist over 1,500 individual cryptocurrencies, and the number continues to increase by the week. This is because the knowledge of creating one’s own cryptocurrency has become so widespread that anyone with sufficient know-how can do it. This overabundance of cryptocurrency, of course, means that the vast majority of them will end up worthless – or at least, not as relevant as the leading cryptocurrencies. That leaves us with the question: what’s to become of these major cryptocurrencies, and of the medium as a whole?Jean-Pierre Landau, Deputy Governor of the Banque de France from 2006 to 2011, stated in a report to the French Ministry of Finance and Economy that the future of cryptocurrency would likely boil down into one of two outcomes: either it would degenerate and become marginalized, or worse, become extinct entirely; or experience what he calls a ‘Darwinian natural selection’ that would decide which of the major players in cryptocurrency attains dominance. In 2014, Landau made a critical comment about cryptocurrency, telling theFinancial Timesthat it was the21st century equivalent of the tulip(which was once used as a currency due to its phenomenally high price) and advised the people of Europe and the world at large to be wary of it. In January 2018, however, the Ministry of Finance and Economy had appointed Landau to look into the matter further and asked him to come up with his own regulations on the medium. Since this appointment, Landau had changed his tone about the issue saying that direct regulation would hamper the proactive development of an ‘evolving technology’ and that public policies should be built around avoiding that. Now known as ‘Mister Bitcoin‘, Landau goes on to say that policies should produce a conducive environment for the growth of cryptocurrency. ifo Institut InLandau’s reportto the Ministry of Finance and Economy, he said that the rarity of cryptocurrency transactions, the most common beingBitcoin accounted for only 0.2% of all transactions in Europe. This was caused by the decentralization of the medium which requires an inefficient and expensive verification method to be carried out. This creates a potentially permanent disadvantage for the cryptocurrency as according Landau states that it is impossible to marry decentralization and efficiency within the context of a monetary medium. Landau advises that regulations should not be set in stone at this point in time as the cryptocurrency process is still evolving and yet to be fully identified. Regulation, in his view, should be fully reserved for the parties making use of the product and not the product itself.

    "news_content": "Crypto lending and borrowing solution provider Celsius Networkhas joined hands with Lightyear.ioto become a leading lender and borrowing partner for ICOs conducted on the Stellar (XLM) network. Lightyear.io facilitates financial enterprises to join the Stellar ecosystem easily. Promising projects, which areplanned to be deployed on Stellar,are funded through the incubator program. Ultimately this expands Stellar ecosystem, while making it easy for project owners to raise capital. Commenting on the partnership, Celsius Network CEO, Alex Mashinskysaid “Stellar Development Foundation’s goals and our own are perfectly aligned. We’re both looking to bring in a new era of blockchain banking to both the developed and developing world and we’re excited to empower the next wave of crypto startups.” Lumens (XLM) and other tokens deployed on the Stellar network will be soon added to Android and iOS apps of Celsius. By the end of this year, Celsius hopes to enable its app users to generate interest on deposits in the form of Stellar-based tokens. Bitcoin IRA, the largest cryptocurrency individual retirement account (IRA) in the world, now boasts Stellar Lumens as the third most popular cryptocurrency. The platform allows investors to buy Bitcoin and other altcoins, including Ethereum, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash, for retirement accounts.Stellar, which was listed only in June2018, has quickly climbed up to become the third most favored crypto among users. Chris Kline, Bitcoin IRA chief operating officer,stated “We just launched Stellar Lumens and Zcash this past June, and it’s exciting to see both coins take off so quickly. With so much momentum in the crypto sector in recent months, I feel confident that the bull market is here to stay.” Stellar Lumens went through a big price correction in the past 24 hours. The crypto lost almost 17% to trade at $0.20.

    "news_content": "Crypto lending and borrowing solution provider Celsius Networkhas joined hands with Lightyear.ioto become a leading lender and borrowing partner for ICOs conducted on the Stellar (XLM) network. Lightyear.io facilitates financial enterprises to join the Stellar ecosystem easily. Promising projects, which areplanned to be deployed on Stellar,are funded through the incubator program. Ultimately this expands Stellar ecosystem, while making it easy for project owners to raise capital. Commenting on the partnership, Celsius Network CEO, Alex Mashinskysaid “Stellar Development Foundation’s goals and our own are perfectly aligned. We’re both looking to bring in a new era of blockchain banking to both the developed and developing world and we’re excited to empower the next wave of crypto startups.” Lumens (XLM) and other tokens deployed on the Stellar network will be soon added to Android and iOS apps of Celsius. By the end of this year, Celsius hopes to enable its app users to generate interest on deposits in the form of Stellar-based tokens. Bitcoin IRA, the largest cryptocurrency individual retirement account (IRA) in the world, now boasts Stellar Lumens as the third most popular cryptocurrency. The platform allows investors to buy Bitcoin and other altcoins, including Ethereum, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash, for retirement accounts.Stellar, which was listed only in June2018, has quickly climbed up to become the third most favored crypto among users. Chris Kline, Bitcoin IRA chief operating officer,stated “We just launched Stellar Lumens and Zcash this past June, and it’s exciting to see both coins take off so quickly. With so much momentum in the crypto sector in recent months, I feel confident that the bull market is here to stay.” Stellar Lumens went through a big price correction in the past 24 hours. The crypto lost almost 17% to trade at $0.20.

The SEC believes that 5-10 exchanges will apply for a license in the forthcoming weeks. Either dealers or brokerage firms which are actively involved in cryptocurrency business is expected to apply for a license. Despite the relaxations, Thai regulator is determined to preserve the safeguard its domestic currency. The regulator has clearly ruled out the possibility of trading cryptos against fiat currencies in the country. The last date to apply for a license is August 14, which represents a 90 day deadline from the date of announcement by the SEC. A sum of 5 million Baht (~$157,000) is required as an upfront fee and only companies which are registered in Thailand are allowed to apply. All licensed cryptocurrency exchanges must pay an annual fee of 0.002% on the total trading volume. Brokerage firms must pay an annual fee of 0.001% on the annual trading volume. A minimum fee of 500,000 Baht and 250,000 Baht must be paid by a cryptocurrency exchange and brokerage firm, respectively. The maximum fee is limited to 20 million Baht and 5 million Baht.

    "news_content": "Invariably, all the human beings born in this world want to have a high standard of living. While it remains a dream for most of the people, some of them achieve it in a short period time. Considering the rising cost of living, it is almost impossible to become a multi-millionaire purely by saving a portion of the salary. Almost 99% of the self-made millionaires have attained their positions either through innovation or investments. While innovations is not easy, raising the standard of living through investments is possible with a bit of effort. Fortunately, the advent of blockchain technology has opened the doors for ordinary people to become millionaires in a reasonable time. A return of 10x or even 100x on investment is quite possible only in the cryptocurrency market as of now. While there is no denial that an equity market is relatively risk free than cryptocurrency market, it may take decades for generating astonishing returns. Therefore, it would be wise to invest a portion of the surplus funds in the cryptocurrency market. Once a decision is made to invest in the cryptocurrency market, we should split the funds in equal portions and invest in the most promising projects. It would be better to invest in at least five good blockchain projects. That would minimize risk and increase the chance of generating huge returns from at least one or two projects in the future. To invest in five best projects, a wannabe investor may have to browse through 100sof ICOs. We have simplified the task for you by choosing the project that has a great growth prospects. More importantly, we have clearly explained why we have an optimistic view of the project. To invest in the project, investors should compulsorily join their telegram group for further details.https://t.me/blockchip BlockChipintends tolaunchan iGaming platform powered by blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies. The company aims to challenge traditional gaming companies with its state-of-the-art platform that offer hundreds of games from third-party developers. The team behind BlockChip is of the opinion that there is a considerable stagnation in the gaming industry as the game developers are not adequately recognized and rewarded. The platform aims to bring a refreshing change to the current scenario by offering professional and financial growth to game developers in a safe environment. The BlockChip’s platform supports scalability, while allowing instant, free transactions. Beinga decentralizedplatform, it is not controlled by any individual or firm. The platform, which incorporates artificial intelligence, enables analyzing gambling patterns of players. Furthermore, the intuitive platform facilitates optimization of player experience. To invest in the project, investors should compulsorily join their telegram group for further details.https://t.me/blockchip The gaming industry is currently dominated by big players. So, it may take a while for Blockchip to lure developers and players towards the platform. Furthermore, gaming industry is always subject to regulatory issues. Though the platform developers have taken all the necessary precautions, still, unexpected problems may arise from regulators. DarcMatter (DM)– is an award winning global fintech investment platform that provides transparent and direct access into alternative investments. DarcMatter is the first truly decentralized global platform for the alternative fund investment industry. The firm already has a global presence with usage from over 24 different countries. Established in 2014, DM’s platform connects GP’s actively raising capital with Investors (LPs) globally, to seamlessly connect, access fund documentation, and invest in a curated set of Hedge Funds, Private Equity, and Venture Capital funds efficiently online. A few other large wealth and investment management companies are planning to come up with similar platforms. This may result in huge competition. FANTOMis the world’s firstDAG based smart contractplatform that solves the issue of scalability and confirmation time of the existing blockchain technology. Newer platforms such as IOTA, Byteball, Nano, and Hashgraph improve on current blockchain scalability. This new technology does guarantee real-time transactions because nodes process transactions asynchronously. However, these platforms lack the Smart Contract dApp infrastructure provided by platforms like Ethereum.The FANTOMplatform adopts a new protocol known as the “Lachesis Protocol” to maintain consensus. Applications built on top of the FANTOM OPERA Chain enjoy instant transactions and near zero transaction costs for all users. As the blockchain will be using a new consensus protocol, there is no guarantee that it is not vulnerable to exploits. Furthermore, adoption may take time as the platform has to compete with established players like IOTA, Cardano, etc., who are signing up new deals regularly. TheNauticusExchange is in the final stages of development and is due to open in mid-2018. When it opens it will offer 100 crypto and six fiat currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, HKD, AUD, and ZAR) Nauticus is also establishing a sustainable blockchain mining center that will provide revenue, and a sizeable amount of server capacity to ensure ultra-fast processing for all users of Nauticus services. The center will use renewable energy. Profits will be reinvested in the business to support the development of a low-cost eCommerce marketplace, along with merchant and peer-to-peer payment options. Keplersolves one of the main challenges of plaguing humanity – technological revolution. Backed by a technical sound team comprising of leading scientific minds, Kepler will produce ultramodern technologies, facilitate easy access to them, and create a platform for the development of scientific and technical breakthroughs for the future. Why is it a good idea to invest in the project? The success of the project is dependent on the nature of high-tech products they create. High-tech research may result in a series of failures. * DISCLAIMER: All information provided in this article and CoinTrust.com are merely for informational purposes, I / we are not an investment advisor and not affiliated with any companies or ICO/Cryptocurrency Projects.

    "news_title": "Chainlink Unveils CRE: Boosting Blockchain Scalability and Customization",
    "news_content": "Chainlink has introduced a transformative upgrade called the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), a new platform designed to scale operations across thousands of blockchain networks while providing developers with flexible and customizable workflows. The update, shared through Chainlink’s official X account, represents a step forward in modular blockchain design by breaking down essential oracle functions into adaptable components, allowing developers to create more specialized workflows suited to individual application requirements. The CRE offers a modular and composable architecture that enables developers to tap into Chainlink’s capabilities in unique ways. By separating the fundamental functions of an oracle network—such as blockchain reading and API calling—into distinct modules, Chainlink allows developers to integrate these functions based on their specific project needs. This architecture forms the foundation of Chainlink’s ecosystem, centralizing its capabilities in a way that allows for innovative workflows triggered by decentralized oracle networks (DONs) to securely facilitate interactions across various blockchain environments. An especially appealing aspect of CRE is its support for self-serve product development. Through this upgrade, developers can design applications and processes on the platform without needing to embed specialized Chainlink code into core blockchain computations. This makes cross-blockchain communication and transactions easier for developers to implement and enhances the platform’s usability, particularly for teams seeking a more seamless way to manage cross-chain data flows and interactions. In addition to fostering more customized development, CRE’s architecture accommodates programmatic workflows, which can be adjusted for specific blockchain applications. The platform also supports standard programming languages and tools, along with standardized cross-chain components, making it more accessible for a broader audience of developers. This cross-chain functionality opens new avenues for applications that benefit from diverse blockchain networks while maintaining ease of interaction.  Introducing Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)—a major platform upgrade: 🔌 New modular, composable architecture⛓️ Scalable across 1000s of chains🏦 Deep customization for capital markets users🏗️ Self-serve product development 🧵⬇️https://t.co/BE807PgfB2 — Chainlink (@chainlink)October 30, 2024  To protect the user experience, Chainlink has structured the CRE upgrade as a phased rollout. This staggered approach will help the platform maintain continuity for current users throughout the transition. In the initial phase, Chainlink will focus on migrating key services such as the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to the CRE foundation. This move is expected to strengthen Chainlink’s cross-chain infrastructure, allowing for more seamless scalability as additional blockchains are integrated. As part of this upgrade, Chainlink has also introduced new blockchain integrations, including support for the Aptos blockchain. This enhanced architecture allows financial institutions to connect their existing systems with blockchain-based workflows, such as Delivery vs. Payment (DvP). By joining the early access program for CRE, users interested in exploring workflow creation on this platform can contribute to Chainlink’s growing network of cross-chain applications. The CRE upgrade thus not only benefits current users but also extends Chainlink’s reach into sectors looking for advanced interoperability solutions. Chainlink’s introduction of CRE is a significant leap forward for both the platform and its users. By providing a flexible, modular environment that facilitates blockchain interactions across various networks, CRE underscores Chainlink’s commitment to scalability and innovation within the blockchain space. This update, with its emphasis on modular design and cross-chain capabilities, positions Chainlink as a leading solution for developers seeking interoperability without compromising on customization or security. Ultimately, the Chainlink Runtime Environment stands as a promising development in blockchain technology, allowing developers to build applications that cater to diverse, decentralized workflows while simplifying the complexities of cross-chain data exchange. Through CRE, Chainlink continues to evolve as a platform that enables not only decentralized finance but also a broader ecosystem of blockchain-powered applications tailored to specific business and industry requirements.

    "news_title": "Instruxi Launches Mesh ID to Simplify Secure Access to Tokenized Assets",
    "news_content": "Instruxi, an emerging decentralized data management platform, has introduced Mesh ID, its latest Web3 solution aimed at revolutionizing access to tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) for over 22 million U.S. residents. This innovative tool is designed to simplify identity verification processes, enhance data privacy, and improve user accessibility to blockchain-based financial products in a way that aligns with regulatory requirements. Instruxi has collaborated with prominent industry players, including Chainlink, CLEAR, and Space and Time, to launch the Mesh ID solution as the initial module of its RWA platform. This collaboration, announced via a recent press release, leverages each partner’s strengths to optimize identity verification and provide robust data security for blockchain applications. Mesh ID integrates with CLEAR’s advanced API, enabling streamlined know-your-customer (KYC) processing without compromising user privacy or security. With CLEAR’s established track record of serving over 25 million users, Instruxi’s solution stands to benefit from a reputable, tier-one identity verification system. The Instruxi-CLEAR partnership facilitates faster pre-approval and minimizes KYC processing times, ultimately making on-chain financial products more accessible to U.S.-based users while ensuring regulatory compliance. In addition to CLEAR, Chainlink brings substantial value to Instruxi’s platform. As a leading decentralized computing platform, Chainlink supports Mesh ID’s seamless integration with enterprise systems, offering both on-chain and off-chain security assurances. Chainlink’s extensive suite of Oracle services has been pivotal in enabling secure data interactions, a key factor in asset tokenization’s projected $867 trillion market potential. Instruxi employs Chainlink Functions to enable access to real-world data via APIs and utilizes Chainlink Automation to ensure efficient, scalable operations within a decentralized framework. Further strengthening Mesh ID’s infrastructure, Instruxi has collaborated with Space and Time, a decentralized data warehouse for blockchain applications. Space and Time’s zero-knowledge database enables users to verify elements of their data and identity without exposing sensitive details on-chain. This feature enhances security while facilitating privacy-conscious access to RWAs, aligning with Instruxi’s mission to uphold data confidentiality as a cornerstone of its offerings. Austin Przybysz, Instruxi’s Co-Founder and Solutions Architect, highlighted the importance of the Mesh ID beta release, noting that this collaboration integrates KYC and identity verification within Instruxi Data Mesh to enable universal policy enforcement capabilities across the platform. He underscored the significance of combining high standards of user security with regulatory compliance to broaden accessibility to tokenized assets in a seamless, compliant manner. With the launch of Mesh ID, Instruxi is positioning itself at the forefront of asset tokenization, starting with tokenized real estate assets for its closed beta users. As the platform moves toward its full release, the company plans to expand its asset offerings to include additional classes, aligning with its goal to make a broad range of tokenized RWAs available through a user-centric, decentralized platform. Real-World Assets, or RWAs, refer to digital tokens that represent traditional financial assets, including cash, securities, commodities, and real estate, on the blockchain. By converting these assets into blockchain-based tokens, users gain new benefits such as fractional ownership, programmability, enhanced liquidity, transparency, and improved risk management. This emerging sector is gaining traction, with projections estimating a valuation of $10 trillion by 2030. Instruxi’s Mesh ID release signals a step toward a future where blockchain technology provides enhanced access to real-world financial assets in a way that preserves data privacy, streamlines verification processes, and ensures regulatory compliance. Through collaborations with industry leaders like Chainlink, CLEAR, and Space and Time, Instruxi demonstrates a commitment to creating an ecosystem where decentralized finance and real-world assets can coexist securely and efficiently. With Mesh ID’s launch, the platform takes a crucial step toward transforming how users interact with and access tokenized assets, setting a promising course for the future of Web3 applications in asset management.

    "news_title": "Safuu Unveils Safuu 2.0: A New Era in DeFi with Unprecedented Returns",
    "news_content": "Safuu, a prominent name in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, has announced the launch of Safuu 2.0, a transformative update to its original protocol. Building on the success of Safuu 1.0, the new version promises enhanced features and unparalleled earning opportunities, aiming to set new standards in the DeFi ecosystem. Safuu 1.0 had earned a notable reputation for delivering consistent and substantial returns, gaining widespread trust and adoption within the DeFi community. With Safuu 2.0, the platform aspires to elevate this success, offering a more robust and sustainable model to maximize user earnings. At the core of Safuu 2.0 is the innovative Stake-To-Earn model, which allows users to earn up to an astonishing 102,800% annual percentage yield (APY). This model enables users to stake their tokens in various staking pools and receive automated compound interest every fifteen minutes, totaling 96 payouts daily. This frequent payout structure ensures users can maximize their returns with minimal effort, making it an attractive option for both novice and experienced investors. Safuu 2.0 offers a unique APY of up to 102,800%, the highest in the industry. This fixed and guaranteed APY is backed by the protocol, providing users with confidence as they stake their tokens. A cornerstone of the Safuu 2.0 protocol is the Safuu High-Yielding External Revenue Income Fund Forever (SHERIFF) model. This model utilizes Flash Loan revenue on the BASE Blockchain to generate additional income, providing a bonus on top of the fixed APY for all stakers. Safuu 2.0 introduces a novel concept within DeFi called Statically Charged Rebasing. This sustainable interest model issues tokens at a protocol level with a static supply, eliminating token dilution and ensuring long-term sustainability. Through the SHERIFF model, Safuu 2.0 drives targeted revenue to the protocol, achieving long-term growth and sustainability. This automated eligibility feature allows all stakers to benefit from consistent revenue generation. Safuu 2.0 offers a range of staking pools to cater to different investment preferences, each with a fixed APY and the added SHERIFF bonus: 12-month stake: 102,800% APY + SHERIFF Bonus9-month stake: 57,825% APY + SHERIFF Bonus6-month stake: 38,550% APY + SHERIFF Bonus3-month stake: 19,275% APY + SHERIFF Bonus30-day stake: 4,224% APY + SHERIFF Bonus14-day stake: 1,971% APY + SHERIFF Bonus7-day stake: 985% APY + SHERIFF Bonus1-day stake: 140% APY + SHERIFF BonusThese fixed APYs ensure that users can choose a staking duration that best fits their investment strategy while enjoying guaranteed returns. Bryan Legend, a leading figure in the DeFi sector, has expressed significant enthusiasm about the launch of Safuu 2.0. He highlighted that the new version represents a rebirth of the well-established Safuu brand and will usher in a new wave of earning potential in 2024 and beyond. This statement underscores the anticipation and optimism surrounding Safuu 2.0’s impact on the DeFi landscape. Safuu 2.0 represents a significant advancement in the DeFi space, building on the foundation laid by its predecessor. With its innovative Stake-To-Earn model, unprecedented APY, and the SHERIFF revenue model, Safuu 2.0 aims to provide users with an enhanced and sustainable earning opportunity.

    "news_title": "Ethereum Wallets Surge in Popularity as Plus Wallet Redefines User Experience",
    "news_content": "Ethereum has been witnessing unprecedented growth, with wallets now collectively holding over 19 million ETH. Projections suggest this number could exceed 20 million by year’s end, marking a significant milestone that reflects a rising interest in cryptocurrency among prominent economic players. This surge in Ethereum holdings underscores the increasing role of digital assets in mainstream financial markets and has drawn attention to the critical role of secure, feature-rich wallets. Throughout 2024, Ethereum wallet usage has experienced substantial growth, with the total amount of ETH held rising from 11.5 million at the beginning of the year to over 19 million by mid-October. Valued at approximately $2,700 per ETH, these holdings are currently worth close to $80 billion, a figure comparable to the market capitalizations of some leading global corporations. Industry observers attribute part of this growth to the recent approval of Ethereum spot ETFs, which has boosted investor confidence and helped cement Ethereum’s place as a key financial asset. As the value and prevalence of digital assets grow, so does the demand for wallets that provide more than just storage. Emerging platforms like Plus Wallet are responding by offering a suite of functionalities designed to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. In addition to multi-chain accessibility, Plus Wallet provides robust security features and dual rewards programs, making it a popular choice for those navigating the expanding cryptocurrency landscape. Amid the increased focus on Ethereum, another notable development comes from Ctrl Wallet, which is enhancing its operational framework by migrating its $XDEFI token to $CTRL. This transition aims to improve token liquidity and optimize the wallet’s token structure for a more seamless user experience. Holders of $XDEFI and $vXDEFI on Ethereum and Arbitrum are encouraged to exchange their tokens for $CTRL at a one-to-one ratio through a dedicated migration portal, with fees waived until the end of 2024. Leading exchanges, including KuCoin and Huobi, are supporting this transition, and 32% of the total $CTRL token supply will be secured in liquidity pools for the next twelve months. This move toward a deflationary token model reflects a strategic approach to preserving the token’s value over time, highlighting Ctrl Wallet’s commitment to robust, long-term token economics. The rapid expansion of the cryptocurrency market, especially within the Web3 sector, has fueled demand for versatile wallets that offer flexibility and adaptability to cater to emerging opportunities. Traditional wallets often limit users to a single network, restricting their trading and exploration capabilities. However, Plus Wallet has set itself apart by addressing these limitations with a cross-chain functionality, enabling users to manage and trade assets across various blockchain networks from one interface. This feature not only simplifies the trading process but also enables users to engage with a broader range of assets and access new projects at early stages.

    "news_title": "Morph Launches on Ethereum, Targeting Mass Blockchain Adoption",
    "news_content": "Morph, a globally recognized platform for advancing blockchain adoption, has officially launched its mainnet on Ethereum, a significant development in its journey toward creating a blockchain experience that is accessible to mainstream users. The launch of the Morph mainnet introduces a consumer layer designed to overcome common adoption barriers by enabling participants to trade real assets and engage in various blockchain transactions. With the mainnet now live, projects already developed on Morph can seamlessly transition to this broader ecosystem, potentially increasing user engagement and accelerating the platform’s consumer-focused growth. CEO and co-founder Cecilia Hsueh emphasized that this mainnet launch is a major achievement in Morph’s goal to bring blockchain technology to a broad audience. She indicated that most decentralized applications (DApps) are currently inaccessible to everyday users and stated that Morph’s objective is to bridge this gap by providing a decentralized, scalable, and secure infrastructure. This will enable developers to create the next generation of user-friendly DApps and offer non-crypto natives the opportunity to interact easily within the blockchain ecosystem. Morph’s consumer layer is a comprehensive environment combining advanced blockchain technologies, such as optimistic and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, which improve both security and scalability. The solution is crafted to address longstanding issues in blockchain, including regulatory restrictions, scalability limitations, and performance challenges. With these improvements, Morph is striving to make blockchain accessible to a wider user base by offering builders an experience that prioritizes scalability, security, and simplicity. Morph’s mainnet debut builds on the successes of its earlier Holesky testnet, which featured several key upgrades that have been integrated into the mainnet. One notable advancement was the EIP-4844 Optimistic zkVM integration, a feature that reduces transaction costs and offers an updated bridge mechanism allowing for single-transaction withdrawals. During the testnet phase, Morph recorded substantial engagement, with over six million wallet addresses, more than 100 million transactions, 200 projects deployed, and over one million community members. This high level of activity highlights the network’s appeal to developers and users alike and lays a strong foundation for further adoption on the mainnet. COO and co-founder Azeem Khan highlighted that Morph’s goal is to be a comprehensive resource for global builders, providing them with tools to help them achieve success in launching and scaling their blockchain projects. He pointed out that while decentralization is critical, builders face challenges in finding the resources needed for successful project development, launch, and expansion. Morph aims to address this gap by creating an environment tailored to the needs of builders, thereby facilitating a more accessible path to blockchain success. Morph distinguishes itself from other blockchain platforms by prioritizing a consumer-focused approach rather than remaining limited to purely technical features. This consumer layer strategy involves offering critical resources to builders, including funding, incubation, acceleration, and market strategies, all aimed at fostering a user-first approach to blockchain development. Among its initiatives, Morph recently launched the Centralized Exchange Coalition, which includes several leading centralized exchanges, to empower builders with the tools necessary to bring projects to market, attract new users, and secure essential funding. Through these supportive measures, Morph seeks to position itself as a significant driver of blockchain innovation and adoption, facilitating a new wave of user-friendly applications that can appeal to a broad audience. This support system aligns with Morph’s overarching vision of transforming the blockchain industry from a niche technological space to an accessible mainstream utility. By equipping builders with the necessary resources, Morph aims to generate a broad ecosystem of applications that meet diverse user needs and contribute to increased blockchain adoption. Morph operates as a global consumer layer, serving as a distribution hub that provides builders with the resources needed to launch and scale their projects for the mass market. Through the use of hybrid rollup technology, combining ZK and Optimistic rollups, and employing a decentralized sequencer, Morph opens up limitless possibilities for developers targeting a mainstream audience. This unique blend of technology allows Morph to offer a user-friendly experience for developers who seek to create accessible and secure blockchain applications. As one of Morph’s original investors, Bitget, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, will continue to play a role in supporting the Morph ecosystem and contributing to its growth. With these strategic partnerships and innovative technologies, Morph is positioned to make a significant impact on the blockchain industry by paving the way for consumer-friendly, scalable applications that cater to everyday users. By emphasizing accessibility, resource support, and advanced technology, Morph aims to transform the blockchain landscape and drive a new era of blockchain adoption for all.

    "news_title": "Cryptocurrency ICO - Current & Upcoming ICOs Reviewed and Rated by CoinTrust.com",
    "news_content": "          An ICO is a fund-raising mechanismcontrivance where a start-up sells their existing cryptocurrency tokens for either Bitcoin or Ether. The investors get a share in the start-up. The inception of the ICO trend dates back to 2013, where it all began for the ICOs. The pre-developed tokens are then available for the people to trade onall the Cryptocurrency exchanges, given that there’s decent demand for that particular token. With the growing ICO trend, many start-ups are coming forward with their innovative ideas and business plans to raise the funds they require to execute their business. Investors from all around the globe are getting interested in ICOs because they usually provide investors with a lot of money making opportunities. The triumph of Ethereum ICO led to a lot more well-planned ICO projects that followed the path of Ethereum. ICOs have the potential to completely change the way businesses work. They’re already making huge improvements in the fundraising sector. The riseof cryptocurrencieshas completely changed the face of both the tech and financial industries. Blockchain has paved way for many innovations in both of these fields. While everyone is busy looking at the Bitcoin and a few other major Altcoins, there is a growing number of newer coins being introduced into circulation with different features and advantages. ICOs are happening every other day for one new altcoin or the other and altcoins are constantly outdoing each other in terms of improvising and providing the best features. TheBitcoinmay be the most popular and valuable cryptocoin at this point, but you can rest assured that there are newer altcoins coming out regularly which offer everything the bitcoin does and even more.The way that these altcoins are initially introduced to the market is through what is known as an ICO – Initial Coin Offering. The big crypto investors are actively getting into the ICOs by investing good amounts of money into several promising ICOs. Unfortunately, a few isolated events that occurred with regards to ICOs has resulted in people giving it a bad reputation. We should take a step away from it and realize that these are just few bad apples. Even these incidents have not been able to stop the ICO train, as it is still moving forward successfully with many more upcoming ICO projects. Basically, one needs to be careful while getting involved with any type of financial instrument, let alone an ICO. Proper education about the business model goes a long way in helping you make the right decisions from an investment stand point. As mentioned earlier, an ICO works in a very similar way to theIPOmodel. A start-up company or team comes up with a business plan which has a cryptocurrency coin integrated into it. The start-up creates cryptocurrency tokens which will be made available for the investors to buy. The ICO is developed with the backing of a blockchain-based software or frameworksuch asEthereum. Then the whole mechanism is supported by digital tokens which are cryptography-based. These digital tokens are usually known as tokens or coins. The team then comes up with a white paper, which is basically a statement that includes all the details of their project and their business model. You can find all the technical details of an ICO in theirwhite paper. The companies that offers products and services by integrating a crypto token or coin can only be labeled as an ICO. With an ICO, start-up companies can raise the required capital for their business in a very easy and simple way. The investor who buys the coins or tokens gets profited if the company performs well in the post ICO period. The coins/tokens are then introduced into the cryptocurrency exchanges, where the public investors can trade them. The initial investors’ profits depend on the value of the coin after it gets introduced to the cryptocurrency exchanges. The people who invest in the ICO phase usually get a decent discount on the price of coins. By now, you may have understood what an ICO is and how it works. Now, it’s time to get educated about our ICO reviewing process in order to make sure that you’re investing properly. Currently, there’s a backlash against ICOs due to some scams that happenedin the recent past. The cryptocurrency community strives hard to eradicate such things from happening in the future. If you’re interested in investing some of your money in the ICOs, you must educate yourself about the major factors that determine an ICO. If you invest blindly into an ICO, you might regret later if it turns out to be either a scam or a bad project. Investing in the already-established cryptocurrencies is fairly easy when compared to the upcoming cryptocurrency projects in the form of ICOs. The process can be really tricky since we can’t really see what lies behind the fancy whitepaper and the ICO promotions. In order to find andfilter the best ICO projects out there, you need to completely understand the dynamics of ICO projects and the way they’re marketed and executed. Currently, there are lots of ICO projects that are being announced and marketed within the cryptocurrency community. It can be a little complicated to find out the best and efficient ICO projects for you to invest in. To do the job properly, you should properly educate yourself about the different methods of reviewing an ICO project. These include various factors concerning about different mechanisms of an ICO project. By practicing these methods thoroughly while checking out and reviewing an ICO project can help you by leaps and bounds.Following are a few steps that you can take while reviewing an ICO: This is the most important step while assessing an ICO project. A good team most probably is capable of executing the ICO properly. Try to research about the team members that are involved in the ICO you’re considering. You can use Linkedin for this purpose since most of the developers and entrepreneurs are active on this social media platform.Googlethe names of the team members and try to find as much information as possible about them. Look up their past projects and their portfolio to get an idea about them. Make sure to check out if the team had any previous experience related to cryptocurrencies. Check their credentials and educational backgrounds to ensure they’re appropriately qualified. If their information is not available anywhere on the internet, then it’s a big red flag for you to proceed. Usually, the people who hide their portfolios tend to be on the wrong side of the line when it comes to legitimacy. So, finding as much information as you can about the team should be of high priority to you. If the team has any prior crypto experience, find out what projects they have worked on and whether the projects have succeeded or not. If the team worked on a project which ended up a failure, you must consider backing out. Talk to the team behind the ICO and ask them any queries that you may have. If the team is not responsive or unclear with the answers, it’s not a very good sign. Most of the ICO projects have public communities on different social media platforms or messengers. Usually, the majority of ICO teams and communities use Slack andTelegramto communicate with each other. These platforms are used for the general chit-chat and some important updates about the project. ICO teams deliver their messages to the community through Slack and Telegram. The community members are able to participate in group chats and private chats with the other community members and the ICO team members. Make sure that you search for the public communities of an ICO while considering it as a potential investment. If you can’t find the above-mentioned communities, try to see if there’s any other public community on different social media platforms such as Facebook or Reddit. Most of the ICO projects maintain a twitter handle to post and deliver updates on the project. Search for any Facebook groups related to the respective ICO project. If the ICO team doesn’t take the media seriously, then most likely they aren’t serious about the project either. ICO projects generally launch bounty programs to encourage the community members to promote their ICO. Try to see if the ICO project is conduction such bounty program because these programs play a crucial role in the promotion of the project. An ICO project without a bounty program most likely lacks an efficient marketing team. A dedicated token must be created solely for the project to be qualified as an ICO. You must know the exact details of how the token is related to the project. There are several ICOs coming up with silly reasons for creating a token, which end up being a scam by looting money from the investors. If you want to avoid that fate, make sure you know the complete details of the token and why it’s created in the first place. A token needs to have unique characteristics from a business point of view. If a token doesn’t have any purpose, then it won’t have value in the future. Many projects have come and gone with the passing time, don’t end up investing in such ICO projects. Always do your due diligence in finding about everything you can about an ICO token prior to investing. Understand the project and the token that’s integrated into the ICO project to ensure the safety of your investment funds. Find out if the project really needs a blockchain-backed technology. Some ICOs are just plain marketing gimmicks to lure money from the people and eventually go rogue. The token and the ICO project must be compatible with the blockchain in order to succeed. If the project can be executed without a blockchain software, then there’s no purpose of an ICO. So, stay away from such projects that aren’t built on an underlying blockchain platform. Make sure you understand the conceptof capitalizationin the cryptocurrency spectrum before you investigate the cap of an ICO project. Basically, the market cap is the value that’s derived by multiplying the value of a token and number of tokens in circulation. Some ICO projects go with unlimited capitalization, which you need to consider seriously.ICO projects that have unlimited capitalization lets the investors send in as much money as they can. This phenomenon leads to a tricky situation where the value of a token may drop due to lack of the demand. If there’s a huge number of token in circulation your tokens may simply become less unique, which leads to a poor demand for the tokens. There’s another side of this coin, which you need to consider as well. After the ICO is completed, the tokens get introduced into the cryptocurrency exchanges, where they are open to being traded by the public traders. There’s a catch here, which is, the exchanges are interested in listing the tokens that usually raise some decent money in the ICO stage. If an ICO doesn’t raise a good amount of funds in the ICO phase, then it may not be listed on the major exchanges which simply lead to poor trading activity for that token. A token must be available for the public trading in order to get value after the ICO. This is one of the very important factors that you need to keep in mind while evaluating an ICO project. Look at how the token distribution is being done among the team members and investors. If an ICO project allots more than fifty percent of the tokens to the team members, it’s simply a sign of greed among the ICO team. You don’t want to be dealing with an ICO that has a greedy team behind it. Look at the roadmap of the project to find the details about the token distribution. Some ICO projects distribute the token shortly after the end of ICO. While some other projects take a break after the completion of ICO and start the token allotment phase after this break. They usually utilize this time to develop a beta version of the token project. Gather this information about the ICO project that you’re considering and assess how it’s going to affect your investment. All the information about an ICO project lies in the whitepaper. If you’re investing in an ICO project without reading and evaluating the whitepaper, consider yourself a bad investor, especially when it comes cryptocurrencies. Whitepaper of an ICO projects consists of each and every detail that’s related to an ICO project. You can find about the roadmap, token distribution, purpose of the token, and much more in the whitepaper. Don’t ever neglect this step while reviewing an ICO project. Reading and understanding the whitepaper of an ICO project can help you by leaps and bounds. While reading the white paper of an ICO project, take note of all the positive and negative points of the project. Note them down on a paper for future reference. Ask yourself how the project can add value to the world. If the project is of no use for society, then most likely the project would fail sooner or later. Investing in such ICOs can lead you to a complete disaster. Always study what you’re investing in. Pretty much every cryptocurrency publishes their code as an open-sourceon Github. If you have even little knowledge of coding, you can try and review the quality of the code. If you are able to find any errors or glitches in the code, you can determine that the developer of the project is not serious. An ICO with a code that has errors tells you the professionalism of the developers and the overall team. If you don’t have any coding skills, you can check the structure of the project’s code and how well it’s framed. An ICO project without an open-source code must be dealt with more caution. Finally, try to search the internet about the ICO project and see how people in the cryptocurrency community are responding to the ICO. Talk to any friends involved or experienced in cryptocurrency and ask their opinion about the ICO project. Always be careful while investing in an ICO project. Do your due diligence, because it’s better to be safe than sorry.      © 2024CoinTrust.com. * DISCLAIMER: All information provided in CoinTrust is merely for informational purposes, we are not an investment advisor and not affiliated with any companies or ICO/Cryptocurrency Projects.
