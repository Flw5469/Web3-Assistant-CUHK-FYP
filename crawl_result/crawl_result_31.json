Tragically, she became embroiled in the very serious crimes\r\ncommitted at FTX and Alameda Research. Caroline blames no one but herself for what she did.\r\nShe regrets her role deeply and will carry shame and remorse to her grave. The goal of this\r\nsubmission is to respectfully provide the Court with context beyond what was discussed at trial,\r\nso the Court will have a full understanding of Caroline's life before, during, and after FTX.\r\nOne important piece of context at the outset is Caroline's complex relationship with Sam\r\nBankman-Fried. Caroline met Mr. Bankman-Fried at Jane Street Capital in 2015; he was a junior\r\ntrader, and she was a summer intern. In just a few years, Caroline watched Mr. Bankman-Fried\r\nfound Alameda Research and then FTX, grow FTX into a juggernaut, become one of the world's\r\nrichest men, share stages with former presidents and prime ministers, appear regularly on\r\ntelevision and the cover of magazines and newspapers, and testify before Congress as the\r\npersonification of cryptocurrency's future. Caroline moved around the globe at his direction, first\r\nto Hong Kong and later the Bahamas. Far from home and family, Caroline worked long, stressful,\r\nAdderall-fueled hours, associating almost exclusively with other employees of Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried.\r\nAnd Caroline was in an on-again-off-again, sometimes-secret relationship with Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried that she understood at the time was fundamentally unequal. Deeply unhappy,\r\nCaroline repeatedly considered leaving Alameda, but Mr. Bankman-Fried convinced her to stay,\r\ntelling her she was essential to the survival of the business, and that he loved her (while also\r\nperversely demonstrating that he considered her not good enough to be seen in public with him at\r\nhigh-profile events).\r\nOver time, Caroline's moral compass warped. At Mr. Bankman-Fried's direction, she took\r\nactions that she knew to be wrong, helping him steal billions. She lived in dread, knowing that a\r\n1 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 5 of 67\r\ndisastrous collapse was likely, but fearing that disentangling herself would only hasten that\r\ncollapse. When FTX finally collapsed, Caroline felt intense sadness for all the people they had\r\nbetrayed, but also tremendous relief, because she did not have to go on lying and stealing for Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried.\r\nOf course, it did not have to be this way. As the trial testimony revealed, Caroline was a\r\nvoice for not doing what led to this disaster. Mr. Bankman-Fried asked Caroline in the fall of 2021\r\nto analyze his plan to spend billions of dollars on illiquid \"venture\" investments, financed by\r\nhaving Alameda take open-term loans from third-party crypto lending desks. Caroline advised\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried that if he did this, any significant turmoil in the cryptocurrency markets would\r\nleave Alameda unable to repay its lenders—even if Alameda took FTX customer deposits. Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried ignored Caroline's warning. Mr. Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh\r\nproceeded to take billions of dollars in purported “loans” from Alameda. Caroline only learned\r\nmonths later of many of these loans, even though they were taken from Alameda, the company for\r\nwhich she was nominally the co-CEO.\r\nThe venture borrowing spree that Caroline advised against led directly to the central crime\r\nin this case: the theft of billions of dollars-worth of FTX customer funds. After the cryptocurrency\r\nmarkets stopped their meteoric rise and Alameda's lenders demanded repayment in June 2022,\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried, Mr. Wang, Mr. Singh, and Caroline met to examine Alameda's financial\r\nposition, and Mr. Bankman-Fried directed her to take customer funds from FTX to repay\r\nAlameda's loans. Caroline did as he instructed. And when Mr. Bankman-Fried told Caroline to\r\nlie about it to Alameda's lenders, to journalists, on Twitter—she did that too.\r\nWhile Caroline committed serious crimes to further Mr. Bankman-Fried's interests, she\r\nnotably did virtually nothing to protect her own. Caroline did not take enormous personal loans.\r\n2 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 6 of 67\r\nShe did not receive equity in Alameda Research, and she held only a small amount of equity (less\r\nthan 1%) in FTX. While she received significant bonuses at Alameda (consistent with its and her\r\nperformance), she always kept most of her assets in her FTX.com user account, withdrawing funds\r\nalmost exclusively to make charitable contributions and to pay taxes. But after Alameda used FTX\r\ncustomer funds to repay its loans in June 2022, she made no further withdrawals. Caroline declined\r\nto transfer any of her own money out of FTX because she believed that to protect herself while\r\nFTX customers remained at risk would be profoundly unfair. Accordingly, when FTX suspended\r\nwithdrawals and collapsed, Caroline lost access to the vast majority of her savings.\r\nAfter years of serving Mr. Bankman-Fried's interests, Caroline reasserted her own in\r\nNovember 2022, when she stopped lying for Mr. Bankman-Fried: At an all-hands meeting of\r\nAlameda employees on November 9, Caroline disclosed the essential facts of and accepted\r\nresponsibility for the crimes committed at FTX and Alameda, just as she would nearly a year later,\r\non the witness stand at Mr. Bankman-Fried's trial. Caroline immediately began making amends\r\nfor participating in those crimes. She encouraged Mr. Bankman-Fried to let FTX and Alameda\r\ndeclare bankruptcy. Caroline then worked tirelessly to assist FTX's bankruptcy counsel secure\r\nassets. Caroline voluntarily returned to the United States, retained counsel, and quickly began\r\ncooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the\r\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, helping them understand what happened at FTX and\r\nAlameda. A little more than a month after FTX declared bankruptcy, Caroline pled guilty, publicly\r\naccepted responsibility for her crimes, and apologized for the resulting harm.\r\nFrom her first meeting with prosecutors, Caroline unflinchingly acknowledged her own\r\nwrongdoing, without minimization, blame shifting, or self-pity. And she time and again proved\r\nherself an enormously credible and important cooperating witness. Caroline would provide her\r\n3 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 7 of 67\r\nrecollection of an event, and the government would later find documents confirming in minute\r\ndetail what she had said. And so the government met with Caroline more than twenty times in\r\nadvance of trial. In those meetings, Caroline interpreted Alameda's intentionally cryptic records,\r\nrecalled key conversations not preserved because of Mr. Bankman-Fried's insistence on ephemeral\r\nmessaging, and disclosed conduct that not only provided crucial evidence of the crimes the\r\ngovernment had been investigating from the day of FTX's collapse, but also allowed the\r\ngovernment to charge Mr. Bankman-Fried with crimes it had no inkling of before learning of them\r\nfrom Caroline, such as defrauding Alameda's lenders and bribing Chinese government officials,\r\nsee Presentence Report (“PSR”) at 41.\r\nCaroline did all this even as she faced the kind of public attention and scrutiny few people\r\nwill ever have the misfortune to experience. Every shred of her online life was relentlessly picked\r\nover; Internet trolls constantly speculated on her whereabouts, so she had to conceal her identity\r\nwhenever she ventured into public; her family members were harassed; news sources shared\r\nsalacious and unfounded speculation about her sex life; Mr. Bankman-Fried leaked Caroline's\r\ndeeply private writings to the New York Times, which prominently published them; and the\r\npsychiatrist she shared with Mr. Bankman-Fried disclosed confidential information from her\r\ntreatment to a bestselling author, who featured them in the book he released on the eve of trial.\r\nAs Caroline came and left the courthouse each day of her trial testimony, she was aggressively\r\nmobbed by photographers and reporters, ultimately requiring an FBI escort and a line of Marshalls\r\nto protect her.\r\nCaroline came through all that undaunted. Setting aside the media maelstrom enveloping\r\nher, she testified over three days at Mr. Bankman-Fried's trial about the defendant's mindset; his\r\nmanagement of FTX and Alameda Research; and his illegal schemes to defraud the customers,\r\n4 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 8 of 67\r\ninvestors, and lenders of FTX and Alameda. Because Caroline had been truthful since she first\r\ndisclosed these crimes in November 2022, Mr. Bankman-Fried's counsel was unable to impeach\r\nher on cross-examination.\r\nHer testimony was so devastating to Mr. Bankman-Fried that\r\nsubstantial portions of the government's closing argument and this Court's comments at Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried's sentencing quoted Caroline extensively. See, e.g., Tr.2979-2982 (government\r\nsummation, quoting Caroline's testimony about defrauding lenders); Dkt. 426 at 51-52 (Bankman-\r\nFried sentencing, quoting Caroline's testimony about defendant's attitude toward risk).¹\r\nSince the trial, Caroline has focused on rebuilding her life and resolving the civil cases and\r\nother consequences arising from her acts at Alameda Research. Caroline\r\nis engaged in volunteer work and writing projects (unrelated to FTX) including\r\na math textbook and works of fiction. She is finalizing agreements with the government and the\r\nFTX Debtors that she expects will leave her without anything she earned while employed at\r\nAlameda.² Caroline has also executed a comprehensive settlement with the plaintiffs' steering\r\ncommittee in the FTX-related multidistrict litigation. Both the FTX Debtors and the MDL steering\r\ncommittee have provided letters describing Caroline's ongoing assistance. See Exs. AI (FTX\r\nDebtors), AJ (MDL plaintiffs). Caroline has also continued to provide information to any\r\ninvestigations into FTX that have sought her cooperation, including other elements of the\r\nDepartment of Justice, the SEC, the CFTC, the FTX bankruptcy examiner, and the New York\r\nAttorney General's Office.\r\nCourt.\r\n1 Citations to \"Tr.\" Refer to the transcript of Mr. Bankman-Fried's criminal trial before this\r\n2 We expect these settlements will be consummated before sentencing and will promptly\r\nnotify the Court when that occurs.\r\n5 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 9 of 67\r\nCaroline now stands before the Court for sentencing. The Probation Department\r\nrecommends a sentence of time served with three years of supervised release. See PSR at 40. The\r\nPSR grounds this recommendation in Caroline's extraordinary cooperation with the government,\r\nher otherwise unblemished record, and the numerous testimonials of Caroline's honesty and ethical\r\nbehavior both before she started working at Alameda and since she left Alameda. See id. at 40-\r\n42. Caroline poses no risk of recidivism and presents no threat to public safety. It would therefore\r\npromote respect for the law to grant leniency in recognition of Caroline's early disclosure of the\r\ncrimes, her unmitigated acceptance of responsibility for them, and—most importantly—her\r\nextensive cooperation with the government.\r\nWithout in any way diminishing the very serious crimes here, we respectfully submit that\r\nthe policy goals and interests of justice embodied by the section 3553(a) sentencing factors do not\r\nrequire sending Caroline to prison, and accordingly request a non-custodial sentence.\r\nII.\r\nCAROLINE'S PERSONAL HISTORY\r\nA.\r\nChildhood\r\nCaroline Ellison was born in November 1994 in Boston, Massachusetts to Glenn and Sara\r\nEllison. PSR 72. Caroline grew up in the Boston suburbs as part of a tight-knit and intensely\r\nacademic family. PSR ¶73. Both of Caroline's parents are professors of economics at the\r\nMassachusetts Institute for Technology, and they did not stop teaching when they left campus.\r\nPSR 72. Caroline ate dinner with her parents and her two younger sisters each night; they\r\ndiscussed mathematical concepts, debated economic trends, and disentangled correlation and\r\ncausation. See generally Exs. A (S. Ellison), B (G. Ellison), C (A. Ellison), D (K. Ellison).\r\n\"Caroline was evidently an unusually gifted child.” Ex. L (E. Duflo) at 1. Caroline's\r\nparents \"taught her to read at about 2½,\" \"[s]he was reading novels by 4 and had surpassed [her\r\nmother] in reading speed and comprehension by 5.\" Ex. A (S. Ellison) at 2; see also, e.g., Ex. K\r\n6 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 10 of 67\r\n(C. Snyder) at 1. Her mother explains that “keeping her in books [as a child] was difficult and\r\nexpensive.\" Ex. A (S. Ellison) at 2. Eventually, her parents would limit the time she spent reading\r\nbecause, in Caroline's words, “they wanted me to get a life\" and spend time outside with friends.\r\nHer parents also resisted teachers' suggestions for Caroline to skip multiple grades, for fear it\r\nwould impede her social development. See Ex. AA (K. McFarlane). Caroline's love of literature\r\ngrew into a passion for writing. A family friend recalls that during a biennial weekend spent with\r\nthe Ellisons and other academic families, Caroline, “the oldest, would script and direct a play with\r\nthe other ten or twelve children, which they would perform for the parents[,] ... despite the[\r\nyounger children's] sometimes wandering attention.” Ex. K (C. Snyder) at 1. To this day, Caroline\r\nloves writing and she entertains her friends by drafting elaborate scripts for role playing games for\r\nthem to act out. See Exs. G (L. Clark) at 2, M (A. Yedidia).\r\nDuring Caroline's childhood, her parents twice moved the family to take year-long\r\nacademic fellowships. PSR ¶76. After returning to Massachusetts for good, Caroline felt socially\r\nadrift and craving a sense of belonging. Around this time, Caroline “developed a keen interest in\r\nmath,\" and she spent hours with her father “talking through logic puzzles\" and learning\r\n\"rudimentary programming.” Ex. A (S. Ellison) at 2. Caroline found community by joining her\r\nmiddle-school math team. Caroline spent four hours a week attending team practices, another four\r\nhours attending supplemental math classes each Saturday, and even more time attending math\r\ncompetitions against other schools. Caroline was eventually named captain of her math teams in\r\nboth middle and high school. On both teams, Caroline was known for fostering an inclusive culture\r\nthat \"made other girls ... want to join,\" leading to an unusual gender balance for an interscholastic\r\nmath team. Ex. B (G. Ellison) at 2. Caroline also became an internationally ranked competitor in\r\n7 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 11 of 67\r\nlinguistics competitions. See Ex. V (A. Hesterberg) (describing Caroline's award for writing the\r\nbest solution at the 2011 International Olympiad in Linguistics).\r\nAs several people who have known Caroline since childhood explain, “Caroline stood out\r\nfor her independence and determination. She wanted to do everything by herself.” Ex. L (E.\r\nDuflo) at 1. According to Caroline's mother, “one of her first phrases, betraying an essential aspect\r\nof her personality, [was] ‘by self.”” Ex. A (S. Ellison) at 1. For example, when Caroline was 16\r\nyears old, she asked to spend a summer at a Chinese immersion school in China, after having\r\nstudied Mandarin for about six years, but her parents could not find any program oriented toward\r\nstudents like her. See id. So, Caroline set off on her own for a three-week program designed for\r\nadults learning Mandarin for professional reasons. See id. Caroline only realized upon arriving in\r\nBeijing that she was the only child in the program; though overwhelmed, she thrived. See id.\r\nDespite Caroline's brilliance, her friends and family know her as someone “low-key and\r\ndown to earth,\" who “has never seemed particularly interested in glamour or being the center of\r\nattention.” Ex. Q (J. Chevalier). Caroline “stood out in her unfailing kindness,” as a person who\r\n\"consistently helped create positive and compassionate spaces\" for others. Ex. AD (D. Wang).\r\nMany of the letters written in support of Caroline are from friends who have known her since\r\nchildhood, and they uniformly describe her as “extremely generous and loyal towards others,\" who\r\noften “expresse[s] her friendship in many small ways,\" Ex. F (M. Dinsmore) at 2, and who \"rarely\r\nputs herself or her needs first,” Ex. A (S. Ellison) at 4. Several letters describe how Caroline's\r\nfriends and family were “struck by how much love and support she showed to a close friend around\r\nthe time of that friend's father's death\" by suicide. Ex. F (M. Dinsmore) at 2; see also Ex. A (S.\r\nEllison) at 2. In the wake of this tragedy, Caroline recalls that her friend spent so much time at\r\nher house that she was thought of as a fourth Ellison sister. Nor was Caroline's support for a friend\r\n8 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 12 of 67\r\nin crisis a one-off occurrence. A childhood friend's letter describes Caroline's supportive reaction\r\nwhen he lost a brother to suicide in 2021:\r\nAlthough Caroline and I were not in regular communication at that time, she went out of\r\nher way to extend herself and make herself available to me in an extraordinary manner.\r\nThose who have experienced loss often report that even close friends and family pull away\r\nin the aftermath: not Caroline. Her response was far beyond what I could have expected.\r\nEx. F (M. Dinsmore) at 2.\r\nB.\r\nCollege\r\nAfter high school, Caroline moved to Palo Alto to study mathematics at Stanford\r\nUniversity. In the words of Caroline's academic advisor in the mathematics department, \"she\r\nthrived\" academically. Ex. N (R. Vakil). Caroline's transcript is laden with advanced math and\r\nlinguistics courses, and she was accepted to a master's program in computer science. See id.\r\nCaroline also developed deep and lasting friendships, as reflected in several letters of support from\r\nher college classmates. See Exs. H\r\nOutside of class, Caroline's most significant activities revolved around Stanford's effective\r\naltruism (\"EA\") community, which she helped foster. “[E]ffective altruism is the project of using\r\nevidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on\r\nthat basis.... [E]ffective altruists aim to maximise the wellbeing of all, where ... everyone counts\r\nfor one,\r\n\"\r\nand no-one for more than one. W. MacAskill, “Effective Altruism: Introduction,” Essays\r\nin Philosophy 2, Vol. 18:1 (2017). Caroline recalls that EA was just beginning to gain adherents\r\nat the time; she learned about EA in various online communities devoted to the philosophy of\r\nrationalism, which appealed to her as she moved away from the Catholic faith of her youth. A\r\nfriend from one of Caroline's first-trimester courses invited Caroline to join an EA group she was\r\nstarting. Caroline was the fifth member; but the small, dedicated group soon grew. Caroline read\r\n9 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 13 of 67\r\ndeeply in the burgeoning EA literature and started a blog on which she wrote about EA-related\r\ntopics.\r\nAs described in many of the attached letters, Caroline has spent an enormous amount of\r\ntime throughout her life considering how to live ethically. Even in “high school ... Caroline spoke\r\nfrequently about moral principles, how to live a good life, and obligations of service to others.\"\r\nEx. F (M. Dinsmore) at 1. For many years before attending college, Caroline's Catholic faith\r\nframed this question. She prayed regularly, attended church with her mother and sisters, and was\r\n“a devout altar server,” Ex. K (C. Snyder) at 1. But, as her lifelong friend and Confirmation\r\nclassmate explains in his letter, Caroline began to struggle with her faith late in high school. See\r\nEx. F (M. Dinsmore) at 1. This was a stressful experience, as Catholicism formed the basis of her\r\nmoral framework, bound her to her family, and provided her with an important source of\r\ncommunity. This ethical evolution left Caroline “looking for something more intellectually\r\ncoherent, in her view, than Catholicism seemed to be.” Id. Eventually, “Caroline became\r\ninterested in [EA].” Even to her friends and family critical of EA, Caroline's embrace of EA\r\n“seemed like the logical outcome of her passion for ethical commitment, one that offered\r\ncommunity and purpose in a secular manner.” Id. A close family friend explained that it is \"[m]y\r\nfirm belief... that” Caroline's “move[] from Catholicism to Effective Altruism... was a\r\ncontinuation of her spiritual journ[ey], a serious search for how to live a good and holy life.” Ex.\r\nK (C. Snyder) at 1.\r\nCaroline found herself particularly drawn to the EA precept of “earning to give,” which \"is\r\nthe idea that instead of working directly to tackle a pressing problem, you take a job where you\r\nearn more money than you would have otherwise and donate much of the extra to fund others\r\n10 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 14 of 67\r\ndoing effective work on those problems.”³ As described in numerous letters, Caroline began to\r\ndonate a large portion of her spending money to charity and would carefully research different\r\norganizations and causes to determine which contributions would likely have the greatest overall\r\nbenefit. Initially, Caroline focused on global health and animal welfare charities (she has been a\r\nvegetarian since age 16). Over time, however, Caroline became increasingly concerned about\r\nlong-term societal prospects. As a college friend explains:\r\n-\r\nCaroline subscribed to a[n] esoteric philosophy – that the happiness of people yet to be\r\nborn is as important as ours today. Caroline also expressed concern that artificial\r\nintelligence would take over the world and cause humanity's extinction. This worldview\r\nled Caroline to believe that her highest and best purpose should be to make as much money\r\nas she could while spending those funds on preventing this AI disaster…….. [M]any people\r\nin Silicon Valley [shared Caroline's concern], including some of its most powerful leaders.\r\nEx. G (L. Clark) at 1.\r\nLater, Caroline would devote much of her charitable giving to AI safety efforts. One painful\r\nconsequence of Caroline's crimes has been that she has been totally cut off from the EA movement,\r\nto which Caroline had been so devoted.\r\nCollege also led to Caroline's first experiences dating. Caroline's early relationships\r\npresage in certain ways her dynamic with Mr. Bankman-Fried years later. For instance, when\r\nCaroline was a first-year student, there was a fourth-year man who kept asking her out and hanging\r\naround; though she was not interested in him, she \"wasn't good at saying 'no' to him,\" and\r\neventually agreed to go out with him. They dated for several months. Despite never being\r\nenthralled with him, when he eventually broke up with Caroline she was \"super upset.\" Some of\r\nher friends see this relationship as one of several “situations where [Caroline] became involved in\r\nrelationships that were not particularly good for her.” Ex. H (\r\nat 1. Caroline's\r\n3 B. Todd, Why and how to earn to give, 80,000 Hours (Mar. 2023),\r\nhttps://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give.\r\n11 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 15 of 67\r\nclose friend from Stanford \"remember[s] feeling frustrated on more than one occasion that an\r\notherwise intelligent young woman had what seemed to me to be sub-optimal judgment when it\r\ncame to romantic relationships.\" Id.\r\nC.\r\nJane Street\r\nDuring her junior year at Stanford, Caroline's burgeoning commitment to EA led her to\r\napply to paid internships, in which she could earn money to donate. Caroline had no intrinsic\r\ninterest in finance at the time, but a job in finance seemed to her like one of the best ways to earn\r\nsignificant amounts of money, which she could then give away to the public health and animal\r\nrights charities she thought would be most helpful. See Ex. I (S. Fisher) at 2 (explaining that\r\n\"Caroline planned to donate most of her salary to charity,” much to the “exasperat[ion]\" of her\r\nmother). After applying to internships at technology and finance companies, Caroline received\r\nthree offers from financial companies. She chose to spend her summer at Jane Street Capital,\r\nbecause it seemed like the most fun and interesting of her options. So, in June 2015, Caroline\r\nmoved to New York City to spend the summer as a trading intern at Jane Street.\r\nIt was during this summer internship that Caroline first met Mr. Bankman-Fried, who had\r\nbeen working as a full-time trader at Jane Street for about a year. See Tr.642:22. Caroline recalls\r\nthat she and Mr. Bankman-Fried first met during a mock trading exercise, for which he was serving\r\nas a coach. Caroline knew that Mr. Bankman-Fried—another child of two professors―also\r\nsubscribed to EA, and they immediately bonded over this shared interest. Caroline recalls getting\r\nto know Mr. Bankman-Fried during a Jane Street-sponsored dinner held at a Brazilian steakhouse,\r\nat which they bonded over their mutual vegetarianism. Caroline developed a crush on Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried during this time. However, nothing came of these feelings during Caroline's\r\n12 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 16 of 67\r\nsummer internship. Mr. Bankman-Fried worked on a different trading desk, so they interacted\r\nrelatively infrequently.\r\nDuring her summer internship at Jane Street, Caroline learned how to think like a trader,\r\nwhich meant becoming comfortable with taking risks. Caroline recalls being “risk averse” when\r\nshe started, as most people are, but Jane Street created an environment to train interns to think\r\nprincipally about maximizing the expected value, or “EV,” of their trading strategies and not to\r\nfocus on what they might lose. See Tr.694:13-18. Jane Street inculcated this “risk neutral”\r\nmentality in part through formal training, like mock trading sessions; Caroline recalls getting\r\nnervous and freezing up, unable to do quick calculations under time pressure during trading\r\nsimulations. Jane Street also cultivated a culture of risk taking, whether through games or by\r\nconstantly betting on little things, like facts people wondered about or had forgotten. Caroline was\r\nfamiliar with the concept of \"expected value\" before her summer at Jane Street—“expected value\"\r\nis a fundamental concept in statistics, a key tool in economic modeling, and an element of EA\r\nethics—but Caroline does not recall casually using the concept of “EV” to structure her thinking\r\nbefore working at Jane Street. Caroline's training and trading experience at Jane Street taught her\r\nto focus only on a trading strategy's EV and not to focus on potential losses.\r\nCaroline enjoyed her summer at Jane Street, which stimulated an interest in finance. But\r\nCaroline recalls being concerned that she would not get a full-time offer. Caroline arranged to\r\nstay at Stanford for a fifth year for a master's degree program in computer science, because this\r\nwould make her eligible for another Jane Street internship after her senior year. PSR ¶87. Caroline\r\nagain interned at Jane Street in the summer of 2016. But her worries proved unfounded-within\r\nweeks of starting her second internship, Jane Street asked Caroline to forego her master's program\r\nand to take a full-time position as an entry-level quantitative trader. See id. She agreed.\r\n13 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 17 of 67\r\nCaroline started her first full-time job, as an assistant quantitative trader on the equities\r\ndesk at Jane Street in fall 2016. See Tr.647:19-20. Her responsibilities remained limited during\r\nthe roughly one-and-a-half years she worked at Jane Street. She contributed to the development\r\nand testing of the firm's algorithmic trading models, but Caroline was never responsible for\r\nmaking important trading decisions. Caroline neither managed funds for any client nor allocated\r\nJane Street's proprietary capital. Caroline did not interact with any other external parties, clients,\r\ninvestors, lenders, or trading counterparties. She did not supervise any employees, hire or fire\r\nanyone, set any person's compensation, or handle any disciplinary matters. Caroline did not set\r\nor enforce any corporate policies, and she had no interaction with legal or compliance functions,\r\nother than attending the basic training programs required for all entry-level traders.\r\n... never seemed\r\nCaroline's choice to work in finance surprised many who had watched her grow up. See,\r\ne.g., Ex. C (A. Ellison) at 2. “Candidly, I was fairly surprised when I heard that she was planning\r\non going into finance,” her uncle writes. Ex. J (M. Ellison) at 2. \"I always assumed she would\r\neventually be a professor or go into government and work on something like cryptology.” Id.\r\nCaroline's friends and relatives uniformly insist that Caroline was not motivated to go into finance\r\nby getting rich at least not to use the money for herself. “Growing up, Caroline\r\nto be interested in being wealthy, buying expensive clothes, jewelry or cars. She actually always\r\nseemed to be very conservative about money and never appeared to feel a need to impress anyone\r\nin anything outside of academics.” Id. at 1. A family friend writes: “I have little doubt that\r\nCaroline was fully committed to the ‘earn to give' philosophy not to generate wealth for herself\r\nbut to give as much as possible to effective charities.” Ex. K (C. Snyder) at 1. Like others, he\r\nnotes that Caroline's economist-parents “deeply admired her generosity” but were \"somewhat\r\ndistressed that she was giving away most of her [Jane Street] salary each year to charitable causes,\"\r\n14 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 18 of 67\r\nrather than “save a greater portion to buy a house for herself and provide for her eventual family.\"\r\nId. See also, e.g., Ex A (S. Ellison) at 4.\r\nIn New York, Caroline's social circle consisted primarily of other Jane Street employees\r\n(including Mr. Bankman-Fried), because most of her college friends had remained in the Bay Area.\r\nEventually, Caroline started dating a fellow Jane Street trader who had started around the same\r\ntime as she. See Ex. C (A. Ellison) at 2. Caroline recalls recognizing at the time that this was an\r\nunhealthy relationship, but she remembers feeling unable to leave it, largely because they shared\r\na workplace and a primary group of friends. As one of Caroline's close college friends explains:\r\n...\r\n“[Caroline] was very serious about the relationship, [but early on] he said that he did\r\nnot love her, and that he felt it was unlikely he ever would. Caroline was deeply hurt by\r\nthis, yet she continued to date him for the better part of a year after that. [Caroline]\r\nexpressed... that the relationship made her unhappy, but she could not seem to work up\r\nthe momentum to leave it. It wasn't until the opportunity at Alameda came up that she felt\r\nable to break things off with him, and it was not long after that she moved to California.\r\nIn some ways, it seemed like taking the job at Alameda was an escape from the situation.\r\nHer romantic involvement with Mr. Bankman-Fried began within the year.\"\r\nEx. H\r\nD.\r\nat 1-2.\r\nAlameda Research\r\n1. Berkeley, California\r\nIn February 2018, Jane Street sent Caroline on a fateful recruiting trip to the Bay Area.\r\nWhile in Berkeley, California, Caroline met up for coffee with Mr. Bankman-Fried, who had left\r\nJane Street to start his crypto trading firm, Alameda Research, several months earlier. See Tr.648.\r\nDuring the meeting, Mr. Bankman-Fried explained that trading crypto was a new and exciting\r\nbusiness. Mr. Bankman-Fried also described how he had started Alameda Research with other\r\npeople involved in the EA community, that the company had an EA ethos, and that it was largely\r\nfunded by wealthy people he knew through the EA movement. Caroline recalls Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried arguing that her joining Alameda Research would be “high EV”—both for her and for the\r\n15 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 19 of 67\r\nworld because she had the potential to make a lot more money at Alameda than she could at Jane\r\nStreet, so she could give more to charity. Caroline was aware of cryptocurrencies, but she was not\r\nparticularly focused on blockchain technologies or the cryptocurrency sector. Motivated by EA's\r\n\"earn to give\" ethic, Mr. Bankman-Fried's argument made sense to her. As Caroline's sister\r\nexplains:\r\nPart of [why Caroline joined Alameda Research] was of course that she thought she would\r\ndo well at the job and enjoy it, and part was that it would enable her to donate large amounts\r\nof money and make the financial system more efficient. A larger part, though, was that\r\nshe was extremely lonely and was looking for a place to find a new start. At her previous\r\njob she had dated a coworker who, after over a year of dating, still was not in love with\r\nher. When they broke up, she felt like she had lost the support of her friends, who had been\r\nhis friends first, and was still forced to see him every day at work. In what seemed to her\r\nto be fortunate timing, Sam offered her the job at Alameda, and she took it in large part as\r\na way out of this difficult situation.\r\nEx. C (A. Ellison) at 2.\r\nAfter Mr. Bankman-Fried told Caroline that Alameda Research was having financial success and\r\ndescribed its cryptocurrency trading business, Caroline “asked if he wanted [her] to work there[,]\r\nand he said yes and gave [her] a job offer. [She] thought about it for a bit and decided to quit Jane\r\nStreet and move to California to work for him.\" Tr.648:15-18.\r\nCaroline moved to Berkeley, California and started at Alameda Research as a\r\ncryptocurrency trader in March 2018. See Tr.648. She was twenty-three. It was her second full-\r\ntime job. Tr.648:19-20. Nobody could have predicted that in barely three years, Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried would name her Alameda's co-CEO. And it would have been entirely unthinkable to\r\nCaroline (or to anyone who knew her) that a little over a year after that, she would be in a courtroom\r\npleading guilty to her role in a multi-billion-dollar fraud.\r\n“Shortly after [Caroline] started, [she] learned”—not for the last time—that Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried had not been honest with her. Alameda “was in much worse shape than [she] realized. Right\r\nbefore [she] had started working there, they had suffered large losses” from errant cryptocurrency\r\n16 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK\r\nDocument 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 20 of 67\r\ntransfers and money-losing trades.\r\nTr.648:25-649:3.\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried had previously\r\nempowered four people as managers of various parts of the business, and after the losses were\r\ndetected, Caroline recalls those four people advocated disclosing the losses to the wealthy\r\ninvestors who had lent Alameda Research the capital it used for trading. Mr. Bankman-Fried\r\nrefused, saying Alameda would return to profitability. Eventually, those four employees\r\ndisobeyed Mr. Bankman-Fried's directives and told the lenders anyway. As a result, the lenders\r\nrecalled much of their remaining investment, and (under pressure from Mr. Bankman-Fried) the\r\nfour managers quit, along with many of Alameda Research's other employees. Tr.649:3-5.\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried had not mentioned any of this brewing crisis to Caroline before she\r\nleft Jane Street and moved across the country to join his company even though, as he later\r\nadmitted to Caroline, he had known about it at the time he offered her the job. See Tr.649:6-14.\r\nEventually, Caroline recalls that Alameda recovered the funds lost in the errant transfers and had\r\nseveral months of profitable trading. Caroline recalls thinking at the time that Mr. Bankman-Fried\r\nhad ended up being correct and succeeding in business when others doubted him. Caroline now\r\nsees this episode as a missed warning, because it illustrates many of Mr. Bankman-Fried's worst\r\ntendencies: his willingness to lie, his instinct to hide losses and other corporate problems, his\r\nunwillingness to consider others' advice, and his insistence on maintaining total control of the\r\ncompany.\r\nOnce the immediate crisis passed, Caroline enjoyed her work at Alameda Research for a\r\ntime. As a trader, she was responsible for doing research, developing mathematical trading\r\nmodels, and monitoring automated trading systems. Tr.649:15-19. She found the cryptocurrency\r\nmarkets interesting, and she liked the fast pace of learning and the quick turnaround from\r\nproposing an idea to implementing it.\r\n17 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 21 of 67\r\nCaroline initially worked reasonable hours as a cryptocurrency trader. But as her trading\r\nskills developed, she was given expanding responsibilities, which dramatically increased her\r\nworkload. Because \"cryptocurrency trading happens 24/7 and is punctuated by unexpected\r\nevents[,] [s]omeone has to monitor the trading systems at all hours.\" Ex. G (L. Clark) at 2. In the\r\nfall of 2018, Caroline began to feel pressure from Mr. Bankman-Fried to work 80-90 hours per\r\nweek and to take overnight shifts monitoring the trading systems. As a result, there were several,\r\nmonths-long periods when Caroline would work from 9:00 pm to 9:00 am six or seven days per\r\nweek. \"[T]hose night shifts were hard on [Caroline;] [s]he spent many of them sitting alone, in\r\nfront of a monitor and a sunlamp, desperately trying to stay awake.\" Id. Her friends would rarely\r\nsee her. Id. She was so busy that, at one point, Mr. Bankman-Fried pressured her not to attend\r\nher uncle's funeral after his unexpected death, even though it was being held just a few hours away,\r\narguing that it was more important for her to stay at the office and work. (She ultimately attended\r\nthe funeral anyway, wanting to support her father during a very difficult time.)\r\nCaroline struggled to keep up, even as Mr. Bankman-Fried pressured her to work more,\r\nand to take on more night shifts. Caroline recalls that Mr. Bankman-Fried suggested she obtain a\r\nprescription for the amphetamine Adderall to stave off fatigue. Amphetamine use was common\r\nat Alameda; Caroline had no trouble obtaining a prescription from the same psychiatrist used by\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried, his brother, and others in his orbit. Over time, Caroline increased the amount\r\nand the frequency of her Adderall use. See Ex. AM (Reflections on Vacation, Mar. 18, 2022) at 1\r\n(\"The amount of adderall I've been taking has crept up slowly over the past couple years from 10\r\n-> 15 -> 20.\"). In April 2022, while reflecting on why she was feeling bad, and bad about herself,\r\nCaroline wondered if “maybe I'm hitting issues with adderall tolerance,\" because \"my usual dose\r\ndoesn't give me the confidence and motivation it used to () but also if I try taking more it makes\r\n18 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 22 of 67\r\nme jittery/anxious.” Ex. AN (Thoughts 4/15) at 1. At the time, she considered “tak[ing] time off\r\nwork and detox[ing] from adderall.\" Id. at 2. Reflecting now, Caroline believes that this\r\namphetamine use made her more risk-seeking, more focused on the task at hand but less thoughtful\r\nand reflective. It narrowed her focus to completing whatever task Mr. Bankman-Fried had\r\nassigned her and left her less inclined to step back and think about whether the situation made\r\nsense.\r\nCaroline's work relationship with Mr. Bankman-Fried was complicated by her romantic\r\nfeelings for him. Several months after starting at Alameda, Caroline's crush on Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried returned, and he seemed to reciprocate. Around September 2018, Caroline told Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried about her feelings. He proposed they have sex, but Caroline refused, because he\r\nwas dating someone else. About a month later, however, Mr. Bankman-Fried's other relationship\r\nended, and a day after that, he began a sexual relationship with Caroline. See Tr.650:2-10. From\r\nthe start, Mr. Bankman-Fried's behavior was erratic and manipulative. He initially professed\r\nstrong feelings for Caroline and suggested their liaison would develop into a full relationship. But\r\nafter a few weeks, he would \"ghost\" Caroline without explanation, avoiding her outside of work\r\nand refusing to respond to messages that were not work-related. One day in late 2018, Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried moved to Hong Kong for several months without telling Caroline. When he\r\nreturned, he apologized and rekindled their relationship, only to ghost her again in the same way\r\na few weeks later. This cycle repeated itself several times. Throughout this period, Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried remained Caroline's boss, retained the title of CEO of Alameda Research, and insisted on\r\nkeeping their relationship a secret. Cf. Tr.684:22-25.\r\n19 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\n2.\r\nHong Kong\r\nPage 23 of 67\r\nStarting in late 2018, Mr. Bankman-Fried spent an increasing amount of time in Hong\r\nKong, seeking to build connections with East Asian cryptocurrency companies and to fundraise.\r\nSee Tr.2312 (Bankman-Fried). Eventually, Mr. Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh\r\nobtained investments from Binance and others, and they began building the FTX.com exchange\r\nplatform. See Tr.2313 (Bankman-Fried). Caroline was not involved in this effort, or in building\r\nthe back door that allowed Alameda to borrow from FTX. See Tr.660:8-13. During this time, Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried occasionally returned to check in on Alameda Research's offices in Berkeley, and\r\nCaroline twice visited the growing office in Hong Kong. Eventually, in the second half of 2019,\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried pressured Caroline and other Berkeley-based employees to move to Hong\r\nKong. Although Caroline did not want to leave her friends, she relented and moved to Hong Kong\r\nin November 2019. PSR¶ 76.\r\nIn Hong Kong, Caroline lived in a “bubble,” centered on Mr. Bankman-Fried. Ex. F (M.\r\nDinsmore) at 2. Other than colleagues who also worked for Mr. Bankman-Fried at FTX and\r\nAlameda Research, the only people Caroline knew in Hong Kong were some friends who worked\r\nin the Jane Street office there and they were roommates of Mr. Bankman-Fried. By this time,\r\nCaroline was responsible for assigning shifts among the Alameda Research traders, but \"she often\r\ngave overnights to herself because nobody else wanted to do them.” Ex. G (L. Clark) at 2. As a\r\nfriend and colleague recalls, “[i]t became a running joke among those of us with day jobs that\r\nwe never knew when or if we would see her.” Id. Caroline's isolation was exacerbated when,\r\nsoon after moving to Hong Kong, the COVID-19 pandemic set in, causing travel between the\r\nUnited States and Hong Kong to become very difficult. Caroline's childhood friend described\r\nhow Caroline effectively disappeared during this time:\r\n20\r\n20 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 24 of 67\r\n[I]t surprised me when, around the time she joined Alameda, Caroline seemed to pull away\r\nfrom many of the people close to her. Once she moved abroad, she seemed to vanish; I\r\ncertainly lost contact with her, and I gathered from a number of her friends that she was\r\nincreasingly isolated in a bubble of people surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried, their work,\r\nand effective altruism. This was especially strange to me because it seemed so out of sync\r\nwith Caroline's earlier priorities, namely ideas and people. I had always assumed Caroline\r\nwould be a professor or perhaps do mission-driven nonprofit work, and instead she was\r\ninvolved in high-risk trading, even though she had never expressed any desire for financial\r\ngain to me. I had always assumed Caroline would be surrounded by family, friends, and\r\ncommunity, but instead she was living in seclusion from her natural environment. The\r\nfurther she went into this bubble, the less she resembled the Caroline I had known before—\r\nand the Caroline she is today.\r\nEx. F (M. Dinsmore) at 2; see also Ex. I (S. Fisher).\r\nCaroline's writing from that time reflects the emotional and psychological toll exacted by\r\nher work, her isolation, and her complicated relationship with Mr. Bankman-Fried. In a digital\r\nfile titled \"My Life\" that she wrote during the summer of 2020, during her first trip back to the\r\nUnited States after moving to Hong Kong, Caroline described “bouts of feeling lonely” and “bouts\r\nof feeling like my life is dark and hopeless”:\r\nThis really needs to stop. I think my mood for the past couple months qualifies as\r\nborderline clinical depression.... It definitely makes me less effective at work. It also just\r\nsucks. I'm not willing to feel like this long-term and need to do something to stop it, one\r\nway or another.\r\nEx. AL (My Life) at 1.\r\nCaroline identified as “potential culprits” her “work stress,” “isolation in Hong Kong,\" and \"Sam.\"\r\nId. Caroline continued her “introspection\":\r\nI wonder if maybe a lot of stuff traces back to feeling romantically rejected by Sam.\r\nI think when Sam and I are sleeping together, or are in “flirty mode,” I feel better about\r\nwork and life, and don't have the same negative spirals.\r\nA lot of what stresses me out about work is specifically failing Sam, or Sam's disapproval\r\nor something. I get easily upset when he disagrees with me or criticizes me, in a way that\r\nI don't think I get upset if other people do the same things. Maybe I feel like: Sam is\r\nrejecting me for not being good enough, and then everything else he says or does is just\r\nrubbing this in.\r\nId. at 3.\r\n21 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 25 of 67\r\nCaroline contemplated quitting Alameda Research:\r\nPart of me feels like all this introspection. this “I have to work through my feelings,”\r\nthinking about exercise and therapy and whatever are just dumb, when I'm fighting a really\r\nuphill battle to be happy or even okay in this situation and I should just quit.\r\nPartly I'm not sure why I don't want to quit, and I'm worried the reasons to stay are all\r\ngenerated within the framework of “be good enough for Sam” making them suspect.\r\nId. at 5.\r\nCaroline did not quit, nor did she move back to Berkeley.\r\nJust before her trip to the United States, Caroline recalls Mr. Bankman-Fried asked to visit\r\nher apartment for a discussion. After he rambled for a while, Caroline said she had expected him\r\nto ask her to start a real relationship. Mr. Bankman-Fried said he wanted to have sex, but that he\r\nwas not interested in any commitment. Caroline refused. However, as soon as she left Hong\r\nKong, she recalls Mr. Bankman-Fried started messaging and calling her, and he eventually\r\nproposed that they begin a real relationship. The two exchanged several more, long messages,\r\nwith Caroline questioning the wisdom of starting a relationship and Mr. Bankman-Fried professing\r\nto love her and saying he wanted to be with her forever. Caroline was eventually convinced, and\r\nafter she returned from visiting the United States, they started dating. See Tr.650:8-9. However,\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried again insisted on keeping their relationship secret. See Tr.684:24-25. He\r\nrarely agreed to go out or spend time together, and he refused to share with Caroline his thoughts,\r\nfeelings, or even news of his daily life. Caroline described to a friend her relationship with Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried as “asymmetric,” a pattern exacerbated by their lopsided power dynamic at work,\r\nwhere they spent most of their time. Ex. H\r\nat 2. A college friend recalls \"in\r\nJuly 2021, after receiving some kind of work feedback, [Caroline] mentioned, ‘having this boss-\r\nemployee dynamic where Sam tells me I'm doing something wrong just makes our relationship\r\nweird.\" Id.\r\n22 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 26 of 67\r\nOver the following year, Caroline tried to break up with Mr. Bankman-Fried repeatedly,\r\n\"but a few words from him would change her mind.\" See Ex. H\r\nat 2. Her\r\nfriend describes Caroline as \"like someone who says they want to give up smoking but can't seem\r\nto stop sneaking cigarettes.” Id. Caroline “talked about breaking up with him a lot.” Id. In July\r\n2021, Caroline messaged a college friend about the challenge of leaving Mr. Bankman-Fried:\r\nThere's definitely a part of me that feels relieved by the idea of us breaking up which is\r\nmaybe a sign that we just should.... It just feels like there are so many worries and\r\nquestions and confusions right now, and breaking up would just get rid of all of them and\r\nthings would be simple and easy. But also obviously there's a part of me that feels really\r\nsad about it, and like, is avoiding even thinking about not being with him anymore because\r\nthe idea feels too horrible. Also [to be honest] it would kind of fuck up my whole life, like\r\nI work with him, I sit 5 feet away from him, my main friend group is his roommates and\r\ntheir other friends.\r\nId. (quoting message from Caroline).\r\nCaroline did eventually try to break up with Mr. Bankman-Fried, later in summer 2021,\r\nwhen she was about to leave Hong Kong for a trip to the United States. See Tr.650:9-10. Caroline\r\nrecalls planning to take some time to herself, back in the United States, to consider whether to quit\r\nAlameda Research. After Caroline broached the topic of ending their relationship, Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried proposed they instead take a “break” to think about it while she traveled. Caroline recalls\r\nthat Mr. Bankman-Fried had repeatedly said that he did not want to publicly date an employee.\r\nSo, when Mr. Bankman-Fried messaged her during her trip and proposed making her co-CEO of\r\nAlameda, she took this as a positive signal that he might be willing to openly acknowledge their\r\nrelationship; she decided not to quit and returned to Hong Kong. But after she had gone through\r\nHong Kong's lengthy COVID-19 quarantine process and was able to see Mr. Bankman-Fried again\r\nin person, he said he had changed his mind. Caroline recalls him saying that he thought she had\r\nbeen right earlier, and they should just break up. At that point, having just been publicly named\r\n23\r\n25 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 27 of 67\r\nco-CEO and getting through Hong Kong's quarantine process, Caroline recalls feeling that she\r\nwas stuck again at Alameda Research. A colleague in Hong Kong recalls:\r\nIn September 2021, when she and Sam broke up, she told me she was miserable. Of course!\r\nShe worked for a firm owned by her ex-boyfriend, in an industry that valorized him. “So\r\nwhy not move back to Berkeley?” I asked her. She was rich, talented and smart. I thought\r\nshe could do great things. To this day, I don't know why she didn't, but I wish she had.\r\nEx. G (L. Clark) at 3.\r\n3.\r\nNassau, Bahamas\r\nAround the time that Caroline broke up with Mr. Bankman-Fried, he unilaterally decided\r\nto move the joint headquarters of Alameda Research and FTX again—this time to the Nassau, in\r\nthe Bahamas. Again, Mr. Bankman-Fried pressured Caroline to move along with him. PSR ¶ 76.\r\nThis move only deepened Caroline's envelopment in Mr. Bankman-Fried's world. From\r\nCaroline's perspective, Hong Kong had at least been a big city with many things to do and at least\r\na few friends who did not work for Mr. Bankman-Fried. In the Bahamas, Caroline lived on a small\r\nisland where the only people she knew were employees of FTX or Alameda Research, and the only\r\nactivities were working and hanging around the development where they all lived in shared\r\napartments that Mr. Bankman-Fried had directed the companies to purchase. Caroline recalls this\r\nmove pushed her closer to the other people at FTX and Alameda Research and further cut her off\r\nfrom the rest of the world.\r\nCaroline's living situation in the Bahamas exacerbated the complicated dynamics between\r\nher and Mr. Bankman-Fried. Shortly after arriving in the Bahamas, Caroline asked several\r\ncolleagues if they wanted to share a house. But soon thereafter Mr. Bankman-Fried approached\r\nthe same people to live with him. Caroline opposed cohabitating with Mr. Bankman-Fried (they\r\nhad just broken up), but it was clear that her FTX colleagues would choose to live with FTX's\r\nCEO if forced to pick between them. Caroline thus resigned herself to living alone, even though\r\n24\r\n24 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 28 of 67\r\nshe predicted this would lead to her being excluded from her principal group of friends in the\r\nBahamas. But then, Mr. Bankman-Fried proposed that he and Caroline resume dating—this time\r\nwithout keeping it secret. See Tr.684:25-685:3. Thinking this signaled that Mr. Bankman-Fried\r\nwas committed to a more normal relationship, Caroline agreed. See Tr.650:9-10. Caroline\r\nnevertheless recognized quickly that this relationship was still unhealthy: When she told a college\r\n....\r\nfriend in December 2021 \"they had gotten back together. she commented, ‘Maybe it's a dumb\r\nidea.\"\" Ex. H\r\nat 2. Shortly thereafter, Caroline moved into a shared bedroom\r\nwith Mr. Bankman-Fried at the “Orchid” condo at The Albany. See Ex. M (A. Yedidia).\r\nBy the time she moved to the Bahamas, Caroline had become wealthy, at least according\r\nto her FTX.com user account. See Tr.1004:7-10. During the summer of 2021, Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried had appointed Caroline to be co-CEO of Alameda Research, alongside Sam Trabucco, see\r\ninfra pp.54-55. Mr. Bankman-Fried did not increase Caroline's base salary of $200,000, which\r\nhad remained the same since she was hired. Tr.685:4-9. But Caroline also received twice-yearly\r\ndiscretionary bonuses, composed of U.S. dollars and FTT, deposited into her FTX.com user\r\naccount. See Tr.685:10-22.4 Caroline was also given the opportunity, along with other FTX and\r\nAlameda employees, to purchase locked SRM tokens at a preferential initial price. These SRM\r\ntokens soared in value and constituted the bulk of Caroline's wealth at its peak, but they were only\r\nuseful to Caroline if Mr. Bankman-Fried allowed her to access them: Mr. Bankman-Fried had\r\narranged the transaction so that Caroline could not sell or transfer the locked SRM tokens without\r\nhis consent. After she was appointed co-CEO, Caroline asked Mr. Bankman-Fried to be given\r\nsome equity in Alameda Research, but he refused. See Tr.686:1-5.\r\n4 As a component of her bonus payments, Caroline also received FTX equity, which she\r\nnever monetized and is now worthless. See Tr.686:9-12.\r\n25 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 29 of 67\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried had sole discretion to set Caroline's bonus. See Tr.687:13-14. Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried's unpredictable payment of her bonuses would, at times, leave Caroline feeling\r\nvulnerable and serve as a reminder of his authority. For instance, in early 2022, when Caroline\r\nwas due her bonus for the second half of 2021-her first bonus as co-CEO—she recalls that Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried declined to inform her of the amount or make any payment for months after\r\nCaroline understood other Alameda and FTX employees received their bonuses. Caroline\r\nperceived this delay as another stark reminder that, although her title was “Co-CEO,” everything\r\nat FTX and Alameda was subject to Mr. Bankman-Fried's whim. Cf. Tr.687:12-14 (“[H]e was the\r\nperson I officially reported to. He owned the company. And he was the one who set my\r\ncompensation and had the ability to fire me if he wanted.\").\r\nDespite the value of her FTX.com user account, Caroline never lived an extravagant life.\r\nAs a colleague who lived with Caroline in the Bahamas explains:\r\nAt the peak of Alameda's success, Caroline lived a comfortable life but not a flashy one.\r\nOne reason we remained friends despite her seemingly immense wealth was because she\r\nnever bragged about it. She didn't fly private jets, or sponsor celebrity galas, or buy a yacht.\r\nOnce she asked me for my thoughts on how she should redecorate her room in the\r\nBahamas. I remarked that the wealthy people we knew in New York hired interior\r\ndesigners and paid tens of thousands of dollars for the service. In the end, she decided that\r\na $150 online design service was good enough for her.\r\nEx. G (L. Clark) at 2.\r\nAt no point did Caroline buy real estate, vehicles, designer clothing, or other luxury goods. As her\r\nmother explains:\r\nCaroline... has always shopped at The Gap, wears a threadbare coat and shoes that are\r\nfalling apart, and rarely chooses to wear jewelry-she finds it wasteful to spend money on\r\nluxuries when there are people in the world who do not have enough to eat. (I have, on\r\nmultiple occasions, felt compelled to buy her a decent pair of shoes so that she did not\r\npermanently damage her feet, even when her net worth was so many times mine.) While\r\nat Alameda, Caroline did not buy lavish gifts for us or much at all for herself, refusing even\r\nto purchase a modest apartment or house when she had plenty of money, despite our\r\nexhortations that she should do it at least to diversify her portfolio.\r\n26 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 30 of 67\r\nEx. A (S. Ellison) at 4.5\r\nAnd while the Orchid condo was a luxurious apartment, her father's sole visit to the Bahamas left\r\nhim with the impression that \"the super-expensive condo was incongruous with how most in it\r\nlived\":\r\nCaroline would spend all day and much of the evening at the office sitting at one of the 15-\r\n20 desks arranged in a circle a couple feet from each other in a generic office park. In the\r\nevening she and her roommates would often cook and eat together—the Bahamas had few\r\nvegetarian options—and then perhaps play some boardgames or open their computers and\r\ncontinue working. Caroline did take pride in her new Honda Civic [provided by the\r\ncompany for her use], having never before (or since) had a car, but her phone might have\r\nbeen her second-most valuable possession.\r\nEx. B (G. Ellison) at 2.\r\nThe only significant purchase Caroline made while she worked at Alameda Research was $10\r\nmillion in shares in the AI company Anthropic, which she viewed as an investment in promoting\r\nthe safe development of AI. See Tr.685:17-19. This proved to be a good investment; the shares\r\nhave soared in value since Caroline purchased them. The Anthropic shares provide the bulk of the\r\nvalue of Caroline's anticipated settlements with the government and the FTX Debtors. See infra\r\npp.60-61. Caroline also donated millions of dollars to charity, though she took no meaningful\r\nsteps to publicize those donations, and “none of [it wa]s performative.6 Ex. A (S. Ellison) at 4;\r\nsee Tr.685:20-22. As her mother explained:\r\nShe does not behave this way for credit or accolades or to shame others—she never draws\r\nattention to her choices and, in fact, often operates below the radar. We only know of her\r\ncharitable contributions, for instance, because occasionally a receipt would arrive in our\r\nmail if she did not have a permanent address to send it to, and we asked her about it.\r\n5 Caroline made a $100,000 loan to her parents to assist with home renovations. See\r\nTr.685:19-20.\r\n6 Some of those donations were made to donor-advised funds; to the extent money\r\nremained in those donor-advised funds at the time of Alameda's bankruptcy, it has been or soon\r\nwill be returned to the FTX Debtors. See, e.g., In re FTX Trading Ltd, No. 22-11068 (JTD) (Bankr.\r\nD. Del. Feb. 29, 2024) Dkt. 8281.\r\n27 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 31 of 67\r\nEx. A (S. Ellison) at 4.\r\nCaroline also did not attempt to amass celebrity or political power—nor did Mr. Bankman-Fried\r\nchoose to elevate Caroline in his political operation.\r\n7\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried also excluded Caroline from the many glitzy events he sponsored and\r\nattended and the meetings he had with visiting celebrities, even when they were publicly dating.\r\nFor instance, shortly before they broke up for the last time, Mr. Bankman-Fried received an\r\ninvitation to attend the 2022 Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; Caroline\r\nwas excited and asked if they could attend together. Mr. Bankman-Fried told Caroline that was\r\n\"not going to happen,\" and he said he did not want to be seen publicly with her. Similarly, when\r\na friend mentioned that she had seen on social media that Mr. Bankman-Fried had attended the\r\n2022 Super Bowl, she was embarrassed to admit that she had not been invited. Even at the lavish,\r\nmulti-day 2022 \"Crypto Bahamas” conference, which occurred around the time of their breakup,\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried did not invite Caroline to attend the events, dinners, and parties he arranged\r\nwith celebrities and politicians.\r\nIn or around late-April 2022, Caroline decided to break up for good with Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried. As before, Caroline “wanted more from [the] relationship but often felt like he was distant\r\nor not paying attention.” Tr.684:16-17. As always, the personal and professional aspects of their\r\nrelationship were inextricably intertwined. Mr. Bankman-Fried remained Caroline's boss, and she\r\ncontinued to communicate regularly with him on work-related topics, even as it became\r\nincreasingly difficult for Caroline to spend time around him. Indeed, in the same conversation in\r\n7 Caroline twice withdrew funds from her FTX.com user account to make donations to\r\npolitical action committees that assisted politicians supportive of pandemic preparation at the\r\nrecommendation of Mr. Bankman-Fried's brother. However, Caroline donated her own funds in\r\nher own name, and she did not leverage those donations to engage with politicians.\r\n28\r\n28 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 32 of 67\r\nwhich they decided to break up, Caroline discussed how it would be hard for her to continue\r\nworking for Mr. Bankman-Fried, and that she was feeling burnt out and no longer enjoying her\r\njob at Alameda Research. However, Mr. Bankman-Fried talked Caroline into staying. Lurking\r\nbeneath these conversations was their shared understanding that Mr. Bankman-Fried's strategy—\r\nplowing billions of dollars into illiquid “venture” investments, financed by open-term loans-left\r\nAlameda Research vulnerable to a crisis of confidence and, ultimately, to its collapse. She recalls\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried telling her that it was a bad idea to quit, that she was very important to FTX\r\nand Alameda Research, and that things would get much worse at FTX and Alameda Research if\r\nshe were not there. In particular, Mr. Bankman-Fried told Caroline that if she quit, it could be\r\ninterpreted as a signal that there was something wrong with the company. She also recalls Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried also appealed to her EA ethics, arguing that she was “worth more” to the world if\r\nshe remained at Alameda Research—i.e., working for him. For several months at this point, her\r\nco-CEO, Mr. Trabucco had been spending more time on his yacht than working for Alameda\r\nResearch, (though that fact had been concealed to avoid undermining confidence in Alameda), and\r\nso Mr. Bankman-Fried told Caroline that there was no one well positioned to take over as CEO of\r\nAlameda Research if she left, no one that he could “trust” as much as he trusted her.\r\nAt the time, Caroline felt flattered by Mr. Bankman-Fried's “trust,” and she did not want\r\nto be responsible for triggering the downfall of Alameda Research and FTX, which Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried suggested might happen if she quit. See Ex. E\r\nat 2 (Caroline \"didn't know\r\nhow to extract herself without feeling like she was letting down her friends and employees.\").\r\nCaroline now sees his \"trust” differently. Caroline now understands that Mr. Bankman-Fried\r\n\"trusted\" that she looked up to him so much, that she had such deep and longstanding feelings for\r\nhim that she would do things if he asked her to even things that she knew were wrong. Now,\r\n29\r\n29 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 33 of 67\r\nCaroline perceives that \"trust” as an expression of Mr. Bankman-Fried's confidence that he could\r\ncontrol her, that she would keep his secrets, that she would be obedient.\r\nCaroline became increasingly unhappy during the summer and fall of 2022, and she\r\neventually had another conversation with Mr. Bankman-Fried about \"want[ing] to quit.\"\r\nTr.1102:2. Caroline recalled that “he told me that I couldn't [quit], that I was too important to\r\nkeep at Alameda, and he thought I needed to stay at Alameda.” Tr.1102:2-4. As Caroline testified,\r\nshe again declined to resign “[b]ecause I trusted his opinion, and I didn't want FTX and Alameda\r\nto collapse. If he thought that my resigning might cause [the companies to collapse], then I didn't\r\nwant to do that.\" Tr.1102:6-8.\r\nIII. OFFENSE CONDUCT\r\nOf course, FTX collapsed anyway. FTX's collapse was immediately precipitated by a\r\ncrypto-industry website (CoinDesk) posting a copy of Alameda Research's balance sheet on\r\nNovember 2, 2022. See Tr.891-893. Although the balance sheet \"was dishonest,\" in that \"it\r\nunderstated the true extent of Alameda's risk, ... it still showed that Alameda was in a fairly risky\r\nposition” and that it was more intertwined with FTX than the public previously understood.\r\nTr.893:4-6. The collapse of FTX.com, which followed a massive withdrawal of customer funds\r\nfrom FTX, revealed that Alameda Research had misappropriated customer and investor funds from\r\nFTX, misrepresented its financial condition to lenders, and engaged in financial transactions\r\ndesigned to further and to obscure these crimes. Caroline pled guilty to her participation in these\r\ncrimes.\r\n\"[F]rom... the founding of FTX, [Mr. Bankman-Fried] had talked about”—and used—\r\n\"FTX [as] a good source of capital for Alameda.” Tr.718:3-4. Alameda Research “ultimately took\r\naround $14 billion” “from FTX customers and used it for [Alameda’s] own investments and to\r\nrepay debts that [it] had.\" Tr.644:16-645:13.\r\n30\r\n30 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 34 of 67\r\nAlameda Research obtained FTX customer money in two ways: it \"received FTX customer\r\nfunds directly into [its] bank accounts as part of the FTX fiat deposit system,” and it “had access\r\nto an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX.\" Tr.644:21-23. The trial evidence conclusively\r\nestablished that Mr. Bankman-Fried “was the one who set up the systems that allowed Alameda\r\nto take the money, and he was the one who directed [Caroline and others] to take customer money\"\r\nto be used for purposes that he determined. Tr.645:1-3.\r\nFirst, starting \"as early as 2020,\" when Caroline was still just a cryptocurrency trader and\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried was CEO of both Alameda Research and FTX, Alameda began receiving FTX\r\ncustomer fiat deposits into bank accounts owned by deceptively named subsidiaries, including\r\n\"North Dimension.\" Tr.654:22-655:3. Caroline was not involved in setting up the North\r\nDimension system, but she eventually supervised the Alameda Research Operations team, which\r\nreconciled FTX.com customers' fiat deposits and withdrawals with bank records. See Tr.657. By\r\nthe time Caroline was co-CEO and deactivated the North Dimension system, see Tr.1042:19-24,\r\nAlameda Research had received billions in FTX.com customer funds via this route, and Alameda\r\nhad withdrawn some of that money \"to other exchanges\" for trading, “spent [it] on expenses,\"\r\n“used [it] to repay loans,” and “used [it] for investments.” Tr.655:14-656:14.\r\n....\r\nSecond, Alameda had a secret “line of credit on FTX that allowed [it] to borrow\r\ncryptocurrency,” i.e., “a setting” in the computer code that ran the FTX.com trading platform “that\r\nallowed [Alameda Research] to withdraw coins from [its] account, even if [it] didn't have them ……,\r\nor to sell them again, even if [it] didn't have them.” Tr.658:12-21. Moreover, Alameda Research\r\ndid not need to post collateral or to pay interest on negative balances, was not subject to margin\r\ncalls, and was exempt from FTX.com's auto-liquidation protocols. Tr.659:9-660:9. Caroline\r\nlearned about these features sometime around when Alameda Research's FTX.com account was\r\n31 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 35 of 67\r\nfirst set up. See Tr.660. As she gained responsibilities, Mr. Bankman-Fried instructed Caroline\r\n\"to use\" Alameda's special line of credit “to make profitable trades that [it] wouldn't have been\r\nable to make otherwise\" and not \"to keep any more money on FTX beyond\" what was necessary\r\n\"so that if customers were withdrawing that [FTX] would be able to process those withdrawals.\"\r\nTr.661:4-7, 663:17-18. Mr. Bankman-Fried also directed Caroline and Mr. Trabucco in the\r\nsummer of 2021 to draw approximately $1 billion from Alameda's special “line of credit” to fund\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried's plan to repurchase from Binance approximately $2 billion in FTX equity.\r\nSee Tr.666-669.\r\nAlameda Research's most significant use of FTX customer funds came in June 2022, when\r\na broad dislocation in cryptocurrency markets led third-party lenders to recall most of the loans\r\nthey had extended to Alameda. See Tr.753-754. These loans totaled billions of dollars, and\r\nbecause \"the majority of [the] loans were open-term loans, the lenders could ask for them back\r\n...\r\nat any time and Alameda would have to repay.\" Tr.754:10-12. But against Caroline's advice, Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried had used billions of dollars of these open-term loans to make illiquid\r\n\"investments\" and \"for loans ... to Sam, Gary, Nishad, and other entities owned by Sam,\" and\r\n“Alameda had lost a lot of money in the cryptocurrency market downturn,\" so Alameda \"didn't\r\nhave the liquid assets to pay all of the money back.\" Tr.761:14-762:16. Ultimately, after several\r\nconversations that also included Mr. Wang and Mr. Singh, Mr. Bankman-Fried directed Caroline\r\n\"to borrow money using [Alameda's] FTX line of credit to repay loans when they were called”—\r\ni.e., \"to use FTX customer funds to repay [Alameda's] loans.\" Tr.765:8-14. Caroline accordingly\r\n“continued to direct the Alameda settlement team to repay lenders.\" Tr.766:1-2.\r\nAlthough Caroline was not generally involved in Mr. Bankman-Fried's efforts to raise\r\ncapital for FTX from investors, she was aware that FTX was not disclosing to investors the\r\n32 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 36 of 67\r\nexistence of Alameda's line of credit. See Tr.666:2-4, 937:2-4. For instance, in 2020, when FTX\r\nwas undergoing its first audit as part of Mr. Bankman-Fried's plan “to appeal to potential\r\ninvestors,\" Caroline asked him \"whether [Alameda's] line of credit would show up on the FTX\r\naudit because [she] was concerned that ... it would raise concerns with investors.\" Tr.664:11-\r\n665:2. Mr. Bankman-Fried reassured her: \"No, don't worry, the auditors aren't going to look at\r\nthat.\" Tr.664:15-16.\r\nCaroline also was not generally responsible for communicating with FTX customers—she\r\nnever worked for FTX-but she knew that Alameda's use of FTX customer funds was not\r\ndisclosed to FTX customers. See Tr.665:21-23, 824:1-5. When Caroline did make public\r\nstatements that FTX investors or customers might hear, she followed Mr. Bankman-Fried's\r\ndirective not to disclose this unlimited line of credit or other special permissions Alameda\r\nResearch enjoyed. See, e.g., Tr.936:20-937:1 (testifying about making “false statements on ...\r\nTwitter and in [a] Bloomberg article\"). She understood that the purpose of these lies was to conceal\r\nFTX's close relationship to Alameda from its customers and investors.\r\nBy contrast, Caroline was at times responsible for communicating with Alameda\r\nResearch's lenders, so she was most directly involved in carrying out Mr. Bankman-Fried's\r\ndirectives to make fraudulent misrepresentations to Alameda's lenders. The principal\r\nmisrepresentations made to Alameda Research's lenders appeared on Alameda Research balance\r\nsheets that Caroline prepared in and after June 2022. On June 18, 2022, following a week in which\r\nAlameda had returned billions of dollars in cryptocurrency loans to third parties using FTX\r\ncustomer funds secretly withdrawn from the FTX.com exchange, Caroline met with Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried, Mr. Singh, and Mr. Wang to discuss a request from Alameda's biggest lender, Genesis, for\r\nan updated balance sheet. See Tr.783-785. Genesis's request had left Caroline “very stressed out.\"\r\n33 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 37 of 67\r\nTr.784:4. She \"wanted to reassure [Genesis] about Alameda's financial state, but the facts were\r\n...\r\nthat Alameda was in a very bad situation[,] had very risky positions on[,] and ... had been\r\nborrowing increasing amounts of money from FTX customers, and [she] didn't want Genesis to\r\nknow any of that.\" Tr.784:5-10.\r\nAt the meeting, the group “discussed Alameda's most recent balance sheet, and [Caroline]\r\nasked what [she] should say to Genesis, and [Mr. Bankman-Fried] gave some suggestions\" about\r\nother assets \"to put on the balance sheet\" that “would make [Alameda's] assets look larger.\"\r\nTr.784:23-785:9. Caroline did “[n]ot initially” make Mr. Bankman-Fried's suggested changes;\r\nshe \"just prepared a normal balance sheet” and “sent it to [Mr. Bankman-Fried] and said, ‘This\r\nis our balance sheet, I think it looks bad, I don't think we can send this to Genesis. Do you agree?\"\"\r\nTr.785:13-18. He agreed and directed Caroline to \"prepare some alternative ways of presenting\r\nthe information and send them to him.” Tr.786:15-16. Caroline then “prepared a spreadsheet with\r\nseven different alternative balance sheets” by “doing things like combining categories so that it\r\nwasn't obvious that some of [Alameda's] assets were being used as collateral[,] ... combining FTT\r\nwith other cryptocurrencies[, and] ... netting out assets against liabilities to make [Alameda's]\r\noverall leverage and risk look lower.\" Tr.786:24-787:13; see GX44. After Mr. Bankman-Fried\r\nreviewed the spreadsheet, he selected one that falsely “ma[de] it look like [Alameda] had plenty\r\nof liquid assets to cover [its] open-term loans.\" Tr.799:14-15. That \"alternative” “netted out the\r\nexchange borrows”—i.e., FTX customer assets Alameda had taken—“against the related-party\r\nloans”—i.e., transfers of assets from Alameda to Mr. Bankman-Fried (and entities he controlled),\r\nto Mr. Singh, and to Mr. Wang and reclassified “the rest [of the exchange borrows as] long-term\r\nloans.\" Tr.800:5-7. Caroline then “sent [the misleading balance sheet] to Genesis ... [b]ecause\r\nSam directed [her] to.\" Tr.800:12-14.\r\n34\r\n=4 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 38 of 67\r\nCaroline also posted a series of misleading tweets on November 6, 2022, in response to\r\nCoinDesk publishing Alameda Research's balance sheet. See GX875. Caroline had been on\r\nvacation when the balance sheet was published, and she had declined to provide a comment to\r\nCoinDesk. See Tr.892-893. When Caroline returned to work in the Hong Kong office on\r\nNovember 6, customer withdrawals were accelerating and Mr. Bankman-Fried started a Signal\r\nchat to discuss with Caroline and several others his “thought that [they] needed to do something\r\npublicly to address th[e] concern\" in the market “around Alameda's balance sheet.” See Tr.898:15-\r\n17. Mr. Bankman-Fried declined to “be the one to tweet,” because he did not “want to be\r\nassociated with Alameda.\" Tr.898:20-22. Caroline was reluctant to do it “[b]ecause [she] knew\r\nthat the purpose of such a tweet would be to try to mislead people and give them false reassurance.\"\r\nTr.898:24-25. Still, after Mr. Bankman-Fried drafted a tweet and Caroline and others revised it,\r\nCaroline acceded to Mr. Bankman-Fried's request and “sent the tweet.” Tr.900:25.\r\nIV.\r\nCAROLINE ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY AND COOPERATES\r\nA.\r\nCaroline Discloses The Fraud\r\nCaroline began the process of accepting responsibility for her crimes on November 8, 2022,\r\nthree days before FTX and Alameda Research declared bankruptcy. At the time, FTX.com was\r\nstruggling to process customers' withdrawals. That night, following Mr. Bankman-Fried's\r\nannouncement that Binance intended to acquire FTX, Caroline told several Alameda Research\r\nemployees in Alameda's Hong Kong office “that FTX had a shortfall of user funds and that this\r\nwas caused by Alameda borrowing user funds from FTX to repay its prior loans, and it had used\r\nthose prior loans to make illiquid investments in various different ventures.” Tr.1139:10-14\r\n(Drappi). Caroline also refused to lie on a call with the representative of a wealthy investor, Dustin\r\nMoskovitz, whom she had contacted at Mr. Bankman-Fried's request: Caroline explained that\r\nFTX needed an “emergency investment” of several billion dollars to reopen withdrawals because\r\n35 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 39 of 67\r\nAlameda Research had used customer funds to repay loans taken out to finance illiquid venture\r\ninvestments. Tr.1088:6-1089:4.\r\nOn November 9, 2022, at an all-hands meeting of Alameda Research employees, Caroline\r\nexplained \"that Alameda had made billions of dollars of venture investments and had bought back\r\nFTX equity from Binance using open-term loans and that when the loans had been recalled, we\r\nhad to use or we did use FTX customer funds to repay them, which had caused the shortfall.”\r\nTr.1093:23-1094:2. When an employee asked who was involved in this wrongdoing, Caroline\r\nresponded immediately and truthfully: \"I talked about it with, like, Sam, Nishad, and Gary,”\r\nGX433E-T, and that the person “[w]ho made the decision on using user deposits\" was “Sam,”\r\nGX433F-T. See also Tr.1150-1151, 1094:10-12.\r\nCaroline made this disclosure \"want[ing] to be honest and open in answering [her]\r\nemployee[s'] questions.\" Tr.1095:6-11. As the government emphasized in its summation,\r\nCaroline made these disclosures “before she had ever met with the government, before she knew\r\nthere was an investigation.\" Tr.3127:16-18 (rebuttal summation); see also Tr.1008:21-25.\r\nCaroline's explanations to her employees (which were soon reported by the Wall Street Journal)\r\nare striking for many reasons, not least that Caroline forthrightly disclosed the fraud at the heart\r\nof FTX and Alameda Research in the same way that the story would come out at trial more than a\r\nyear later, and she acknowledged her responsibility for those crimes without reservation. See\r\nTr.3127-3128 (government arguing the same in rebuttal summation).\r\nCaroline's acceptance of responsibility at the November 9, 2022 all-hands meeting\r\nreflected her relief at being able to stop lying for Mr. Bankman-Fried. As Caroline testified:\r\nI never liked misleading my employees. I felt really bad about it, but I felt sort of trapped\r\nin the summer of 2022, because I was worried that if I revealed Alameda's actual financial\r\nsituation to anyone, including our employees, that the news would get out and that people\r\nwould withdraw their funds from FTX, causing Alameda and FTX to collapse. By the time\r\n36 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 40 of 67\r\nof this all hands ... meeting in November, it had already happened, so I felt free to be\r\nhonest with employees at that point, as ….. I had wanted to before but felt like I couldn't.\r\nTr.1096:18-1097:2.\r\nCaroline's relief at being able to accept responsibility for her crimes is also evident from a set of\r\nmessages exchanged between Caroline and Mr. Bankman-Fried on November 7, 2022. Tr.914:21.\r\nCaroline had messaged him that despite the chaos unfolding around them, she was in \"the best\r\nmood I've been in in like a year.” GX480D. Mr. Bankman-Fried thought this was “because shit's\r\nexciting,” but Caroline wrote: “I think I just had an increasing dread of this day that was weighing\r\non me for a long time, and now that it's actually happening, it just feels great to get it over with\r\none way or another.” Id. At trial, Caroline tearfully explained what she meant:\r\nTo be clear, that was overall the worst week of my life. I had a lot of mood swings during\r\nthat week and a lot of different feelings. But one of the feelings I had was an overwhelming\r\nfeeling of relief because, as I said, this had been something that I had been dreading for so\r\nlong, for the past several months. It's something that had been in my mind every day,\r\nworrying about what would happen when the truth finally came out. And I felt a sense of\r\nrelief that I didn't have to lie anymore, that I could start taking responsibility and\r\nbeing honest about what I had done, even though I obviously felt indescribably bad\r\nabout all of the people that were harmed and the people that lost their money, the\r\nemployees that lost their jobs, people that trusted us that we had betrayed.\r\nTr.915:2-14 (emphasis added).\r\nCaroline's statement at the all-hands meeting triggered a wave of resignations across Alameda\r\nResearch and FTX. See, e.g., Tr.1151:22-24; Exs. M (A. Yedidia), G (L. Clark).\r\nB. Caroline Assists The Bankruptcy Estate\r\nFollowing her comments at the Alameda Research all-hands meeting, Caroline had several\r\nconversations with Mr. Bankman-Fried, urging him to accept others' advice and declare\r\nbankruptcy. Mr. Bankman-Fried resisted the idea, telling Caroline that FTX was not \"at that point\r\nyet,” because he was still waiting to hear whether “other investors” would rescue his companies.\r\nCaroline disagreed, telling Mr. Bankman-Fried that this path was “not likely to fix the problem”;\r\n37 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 41 of 67\r\nshe argued to Mr. Bankman-Fried that declaring bankruptcy would be the \"best way to ensure that\r\neveryone was treated fairly.\" FTX, Alameda Research, and affiliated companies declared\r\nbankruptcy November 11, 2022. See Tr.926:17-19.\r\nHer colleagues' resignations left Caroline as one of the only remaining employees at\r\nAlameda Research, which faced the enormous task of gathering billions of dollars in crypto, fiat,\r\nand other assets held in a tangle of wallets and accounts at exchanges, brokerages, and banks so\r\nthat these funds could be secured and ultimately returned to customers, lenders, and investors.\r\n\"Within twenty-four hours of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, Ms. Ellison began\r\nassisting the Debtors' bankruptcy advisors by identifying and securing estate assets.” Ex. AI (FTX\r\nDebtors) at 2. Although Caroline could also have quit, she remained. She did so neither out of\r\nloyalty to Mr. Bankman-Fried nor to cover her tracks; she kept working out of a desire to help\r\naddress the harm caused by her crimes and to assist bankruptcy counsel in preserving as much\r\nvalue as possible for victims. On November 11, 2022, Caroline decided to return from Hong Kong\r\nto the United States and went to stay with her parents. During this time, Caroline \"assisted the\r\nDebtors' advisors in transferring hundreds of millions of dollars of Debtor cryptocurrency assets\r\nfrom third-party exchanges and accounts to secure cold storage wallets” and “provided information\r\nregarding the location of the assets, their approximate dollar value, and contact information for\r\nindividuals who might be able to assist in preserving them for the estate.\" Id. Her father recalls\r\nher single-minded focus on assisting the bankruptcy estate secure assets:\r\nAt that point, she set up a makeshift home office and started having multiple calls with the\r\nnew FTX management. As parents, we urged her to get herself a lawyer and consult with\r\nthem on what she should or should not be doing with FTX (and otherwise). But she said\r\nshe was too busy to try to get a lawyer right away. She backed out of one late-evening\r\nerrand she was going to run with me, telling me that the bankruptcy team wanted her help\r\nwith getting Alameda's crypto into cold storage, even though that's something she had\r\nmostly relied on staff for, and she'd need to pull another all-nighter. When they cut off\r\ncontact and fired her a day or two later, she understood completely, but was still\r\n38\r\n38 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 42 of 67\r\ndisappointed, worried that there was so much that the team taking over didn't know, and\r\nwishing they'd known they could trust that she would help out in any way she could to\r\nminimize the damage.\r\nEx. B (G. Ellison) at 3.\r\nJohn Ray, the current CEO of the FTX Debtor entities, describes Caroline's \"early cooperation\r\n[] as valuable in helping the Debtors' advisors protect and preserve\" \"hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars in Debtor assets for the benefit of creditors …… and understand FTX's systems so that they\r\ncould begin to institute governance and controls.\" Ex. AI (FTX Debtors) at 1-2.\r\nA few days after the bankruptcy petition was filed, Caroline had a discussion with Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried, who told her that agreeing to file \"was the biggest mistake he had ever made,\"\r\nand that he was supposedly trying to transfer assets to the Bahamian government, so the assets did\r\nnot get into the control of U.S. bankruptcy estate. In their last conversation, Mr. Bankman-Fried\r\nasked Caroline to help him \"get assets to the Bahamas,\" but Caroline refused, telling him that she\r\nwas \"not going to help with that” because she was “interested in cooperating with the U.S.\r\ngovernment.\" Indeed, after FTX and Alameda Research engaged U.S. bankruptcy counsel,\r\nCaroline exclusively followed their directions to assist in securing assets.\r\nIn the nearly two years since the bankruptcy, Caroline has continued to assist the FTX\r\nDebtors however she can. For instance, “through ... counsel, [Caroline] has also worked with the\r\nDebtors' advisors to answer technical questions and provide information regarding private keys to\r\ncryptocurrency wallets that contain estate assets, DeFi positions, FTX exchange internal account\r\ninformation, the use of third-party exchanges for pre-petition trading, and pre-petition auditing\r\npractices.\" Ex. AI (FTX Debtors) at 2. Caroline has “also made substantial productions of\r\ndocuments to the Debtors” and continues to cooperate with the Debtors' investigation and\r\nlitigation of adversary proceedings against recipients of capital from Alameda Research and FTX.\r\nId.\r\n39\r\n39 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 43 of 67\r\nC.\r\nCooperation with the United States Government\r\nAfter Caroline returned to the United States and around the time she was officially fired by\r\nthe Debtors, she retained counsel and began engaging cooperatively with the U.S. Attorney's\r\nOffice.\r\nOn December 8, 2022, Caroline sat for her first of many proffer sessions with\r\nrepresentatives from the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the SEC, and\r\nthe CFTC. Even at that early stage, and lacking access to most Alameda Research documents,\r\nCaroline described in detail documents and conversations that would feature prominently at Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried's trial. For instance, at Caroline's first proffer session, she described accurately\r\nand in detail the spreadsheet presenting “seven different alternative balance sheets\" that she created\r\nat Mr. Bankman-Fried's direction for the purpose of “conceal[ing] the things in our balance sheet\r\nthat we both thought looked bad.\" Tr.786:20-25; see GX44. Caroline explained in her first\r\nmeeting with the government how Mr. Bankman-Fried had selected the “alternative” balance sheet\r\nthat \"ma[d]e Alameda look less risky” by \"net[ing] out the exchange borrows against the related-\r\nparty loans and then mov[ing] the rest to the long-term loans category.\" Tr.798:24-800:7. At the\r\ntime, neither Caroline nor the government had possession of this document. Months later, Caroline\r\nidentified this otherwise-anonymous spreadsheet for the government in a collection of thousands\r\nof documents obtained from the Debtors' files. This spreadsheet became the centerpiece of the\r\ngovernment's case against Mr. Bankman-Fried for fraud and conspiracy against the lenders to\r\nAlameda Research. See PSR at 41, Tr. 784-804 (describing preparation and transmission of the\r\nfraudulent balance sheet). The inability of Mr. Bankman-Fried's counsel to impeach Caroline\r\n8\r\nThe government's seizure of Caroline's phone and computer shortly after she returned to\r\nthe United States created challenges that made it difficult to meet sooner.\r\n40 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 44 of 67\r\nregarding this critical spreadsheet reflects that she was totally consistent in her description of its\r\ncreation, meaning, and use from her very first meeting with the government through the conclusion\r\nof her testimony. See Tr.1069-1074.\r\nIn a later meeting, Caroline revealed to the Government that Mr. Bankman-Fried had\r\ndirected the payment of a bribe to unfreeze Alameda Research accounts on cryptocurrency\r\nexchanges based in China. See Tr.827-833, 837-843. Indeed, the Government “would not have\r\nbeen able to charge [Mr.] Bankman-Fried with lender fraud or foreign bribery had it not been for\r\n[Caroline's] information.” PSR at 41.\r\nAfter providing the government with four proffer sessions over a single week, Caroline\r\nentered a cooperation agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office and pled guilty to seven counts\r\nbefore Judge Abrams on December 19, 2022. Pained at the harm she had helped to cause, Caroline\r\nused her plea allocution as an opportunity to describe her crimes in detail, to accept responsibility,\r\nand to apologize:\r\nI am truly sorry for what I did. I knew that it was wrong. And I want to apologize for my\r\nactions to the affected customers of FTX, lenders to Alameda and investors in FTX. Since\r\nFTX and Alameda collapsed in November 2022, I have worked hard to assist with the\r\nrecovery of assets for the benefit of customers and to cooperate with the government's\r\ninvestigation. I am here today to accept responsibility for my actions by pleading guilty.\r\nDkt. 19 at 29:2-9.\r\nCaroline simultaneously entered into consent judgments with the SEC and CFTC and cooperated\r\nwith these agencies. See Securities & Exchange Commission v. Ellison, No. 1:22-cv-10794\r\n(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2022) Dkt. 15; Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Bankman-Fried,\r\nNo. 1:22-cv-10503 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2022) Dkt. 26. Pursuant to these settlements, Caroline\r\naccepted lifetime bans from working in the securities or commodities industries, from trading\r\nsecurities or certain cryptocurrencies on behalf of others, and from serving as the officer or director\r\nof any public company. See id. These settlements also provided the framework within which\r\n41 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 45 of 67\r\nCaroline proceeded to provide both the SEC and CFTC with information to further their\r\ninvestigations of FTX and other players in the cryptocurrency markets.\r\nOver the nine months between her plea and Mr. Bankman-Fried's trial, Caroline worked\r\ndiligently to assist the government's investigation into the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research.\r\nCaroline met with the government more than twenty times to provide information about the\r\noperations of Alameda Research and FTX, to review documents and other evidence collected by\r\nthe government, and to prepare for her trial testimony.9 Caroline also helped the government\r\novercome some of the challenges particular to this case: Mr. Bankman-Fried's use of ephemeral\r\nmessaging and the poor record-keeping of his companies. See Tr.825:9-19. Indeed, the most\r\nsensitive communications between Mr. Bankman-Fried and Caroline and among Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried, Mr. Singh, Mr. Wang, and Caroline occurred on Signal threads that were devoid of nearly\r\nall messages sent before November 2022. See, e.g., GX1659.\r\nFor instance, Caroline reviewed hundreds of documents collected from Alameda\r\nResearch's cloud storage account to identify documents that reflected Mr. Bankman-Fried's\r\nknowledge of Alameda Research's financial position and his intent for Alameda Research to use\r\nFTX.com customer deposits. Caroline also helped the government's forensic experts calculate\r\nAlameda's valuation and the extent of Alameda Research's use of FTX.com customer assets over\r\ntime. Parsing Alameda Research's poor internal records was complicated by vague titles and\r\nunlabeled calculations on any documents reflecting misuse of customer funds. See Tr.843:22-\r\n844:7. This, Caroline testified, was a result of Mr. Bankman-Fried's repeated directive \"that\r\n[employees] should be very careful about what we put in writing,” because “putting things in\r\ncounsel.\r\n9 Caroline also assisted the government by providing numerous factual proffers through\r\n42 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 46 of 67\r\nwriting was one of the primary ways that financial firms got in legal trouble.\" See Tr.825:9-12.\r\nAlameda documents also tended to “sp[eak] in coded terms about potential criminal activity,\" such\r\nas in connection with the bribe of Chinese officials. Tr.827:6-7; see, e.g., GX64 (\"State of\r\nAlameda\" document referring to the bribe as “negative 150M from the thing?”).\r\nThrough her review of Alameda Research records, Caroline identified and explained for\r\nthe government several vaguely worded documents that became so central to the government's\r\ncase that they were featured in the government's closing argument. See PSR at 41. For instance,\r\nCaroline identified for the government the “NAV Minus SamCoins” spreadsheet from fall 2021,\r\nin which Caroline analyzed the risks involved in Mr. Bankman-Fried's plan to make an additional\r\n$3 billion in “venture” investments funded by open-term loans and backstopped by FTX customer\r\ndeposits. See GX36. She also located the spreadsheet with seven “alternative” presentations of\r\nAlameda Research's balance sheet, which she had told the government about in her very first\r\ninterview. See GX44. Caroline also identified for the government critical communications with\r\nAlameda Research's counterparties, including chats from mid-June 2022 in which crypto lending\r\ndesks such as Genesis recalled billions of dollars in loans to Alameda Research. See, e.g., GX1647.\r\nAnd because Mr. Bankman-Fried had long required Caroline to prepare Alameda Research's\r\nbalance sheets, both for internal and external purposes, Caroline was uniquely able to identify,\r\nreconcile, and explain balance sheets that conveyed to Mr. Bankman-Fried the scale of Alameda\r\nResearch's use of FTX.com customer funds and “loans” to Mr. Bankman-Fried, Mr. Singh, Mr.\r\nWang, and Mr. Salame—but concealed those facts from lenders. See, e.g., GX10, GX11, GX19,\r\nGX418, GX419, GX460.\r\nAs the Court will recall, Caroline testified at trial for nearly three days. Caroline was able\r\nto provide the jury with crucial testimony on two aspects of Mr. Bankman-Fried's mental state.\r\n43 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 47 of 67\r\nFirst, Caroline testified credibly and in detail about numerous communications she had with Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried that definitively established his criminal mens rea, including his intent to use\r\nFTX.com customer funds for his own purposes via Alameda Research's special access. See, e.g.,\r\nTr.666-670 (testifying about Mr. Bankman-Fried's summer 2021 instruction for Alameda\r\nResearch to use FTX.com customer funds to repurchase FTX equity from Binance); Tr.695-730\r\n(testifying about Mr. Bankman-Fried's fall 2021 decision to fund $3 billion in \"venture\"\r\ninvestments with borrowed funds); Tr.784-804 (testifying about Mr. Bankman-Fried's instruction\r\nto create \"alternative” balance sheets for Alameda Research's lenders and to send a dishonest\r\nbalance sheet to Genesis); Tr.763-766 (testifying about Mr. Bankman-Fried's instruction for\r\nAlameda Research to repay third-party loans with FTX.com customer funds in mid-June 2022).\r\nSecond, as Mr. Bankman-Fried's romantic partner and confidant, Caroline memorably\r\ntestified about Mr. Bankman-Fried's private views on issues like honesty, see, e.g., Tr.807 (\"He\r\nsaid that he was a utilitarian, and he believed that the ways that people tried to justify rules like\r\ndon't lie and don't steal within utilitarianism didn't work.”); his goals, see Tr.650 (“He was also\r\nvery interested in politics and talked about wanting to use his money to have influence on politics.\r\nHe said at one point he thought there was a 5 percent chance he would become president some\r\nday.\"); his personal branding strategy, see Tr.863:4-7 (“He said he thought his hair had been very\r\nvaluable ... and that it was an important part of FTX's narrative and image.\"); and his attitude\r\ntoward risk taking, see Tr.695:1-5 (“[I]n the context of thinking about what was good for the world,\r\n[he said] that he would be happy to flip a coin, if it came up tails and the world was destroyed, as\r\nlong as if it came up heads the world would be like more than twice as good.”). Caroline thereby\r\nhelped the government establish its central rebuttal to Mr. Bankman-Fried's defense of \"good\r\nfaith\" mistake, see, e.g., Tr.3035-3039 (defense summation):\r\n44 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 48 of 67\r\nWhile many aspects of this case have been the subject of unusually keen public attention,\r\nthe press and internet users have been particularly fascinated with Caroline and her role as a\r\ncooperator. The media have aggressively speculated about Caroline's personal history, her\r\nromantic life, and her physical whereabouts. As this Court well knows, see Dkt. 200 (revoking\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried's bail), “that media atmosphere [was] in part a product of [Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried]'s own creation and of his sustained effort to focus the media on Ellison's personal life and\r\nprivate writings,\" Dkt. 188 at 3 (government's reply in support of detention). For instance, Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried leaked to the New York Times several letters that Caroline had written him about\r\ntheir relationship and that the Court accurately described as being of an “extremely ... personal\r\nand intimate” nature. Dkt. 224 at 37:10-11. Mr. Bankman-Fried did so in a manner “obviously\r\ndesigned to intimidate, harass, and embarrass someone he kn[ew] [wa]s slated to testify against\r\nhim.” Dkt. 188 at 3 (government's reply in support of detention). 10 And Mr. Bankman-Fried's\r\nallies have repeatedly conspired to invade Caroline's privacy. On the eve of trial, for instance, a\r\nprominent author published a best-selling book that both quoted from other letters Caroline had\r\nwritten Mr. Bankman-Fried about their dysfunctional relationship and detailed aspects of their\r\nsexual relationship. See M. Lewis, Going Infinite 165-166 (W.W. Norton & Co. 2023). Indeed,\r\nthe book gallingly includes quotes from Caroline's former psychiatrist, who spoke disparagingly\r\nabout Caroline's psychological makeup and the “issues [Caroline] wanted to talk about” during\r\n\"session[s].\" Id. at 139.11\r\n10\r\nSee D. Yaffee-Bellany and M. Goldstein, Inside the Private writings of Caroline Ellison,\r\nStar Witness in the FTX Case, N.Y. Times (July 20, 2023), https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/\r\ntechnology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html.\r\n11 The psychiatrist, Dr. George Lerner, who had treated both Caroline and Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried, has actively supported Mr. Bankman-Fried in his criminal case. See Dkts. 201-1 (letter\r\nconcerning medication), 407-17 (sentencing letter in support of Mr. Bankman-Fried).\r\n45 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 49 of 67\r\nThe media fixation on Caroline fostered by Mr. Bankman-Fried has also affected\r\nCaroline's personal relationships and family members. The press (and others) have hounded\r\nCaroline's parents and sisters, showing up on their doorsteps and revealing the locations of their\r\nresidences on the Internet. 12 Her family members have also been subject to online harassment and\r\nthreats. Caroline has effectively lived in hiding since December 4, 2022, when the Internet\r\nrampantly speculated on her whereabouts after she was spotted buying a tea in New York City,\r\nseveral blocks from the U.S. Attorney's Office. 13 She has been recognized and approached in\r\npublic on numerous occasions, and as a result is wary of going out in public. In view of this\r\ncontinual feeding frenzy, numerous otherwise-supportive friends declined to file sentencing letters\r\non Caroline's behalf, explaining they were afraid that even court-ordered sealing would not protect\r\nthem from doxing.\r\nD.\r\nAssistance for FTX Customers, the FTX Debtors, And Other Investigations\r\nCaroline has sought to make amends by assisting not just the U.S. government and the FTX\r\nDebtors, but any entity seeking to investigate the collapse of FTX or recover value for victims.\r\nFor instance, shortly after Caroline finished testifying in Mr. Bankman-Fried's criminal trial,\r\nCaroline reached a comprehensive stipulation of settlement with FTX's customers who are\r\nplaintiffs in the multidistrict litigation currently pending before Judge Moore in the Southern\r\nDistrict of Florida. See In re FTX Cryptocurrency Exchange Collapse Litigation, No. 1:23-md-\r\n3076 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 27, 2023) Dkt. 565-2 at 3-46 (stipulation of settlement, dated Jan. 23, 2024).\r\n12 See, e.g., O. Land, Who are Caroline Ellison's parents? Fraudster's mom and dad are\r\nMIT economists, N.Y. Post (Dec. 23, 2022), https://nypost.com/2022/12/23/who-are-caroline-\r\nellisons-parents-fraudsters-parents-are-mit-economists.\r\n13 See B. Quarmby, Alameda ex-CEO Caroline Ellison spotted in New York, Twitter users\r\nclaim, CoinTelegraph.com (Dec. 5, 2022), https://cointelegraph.com/news/alameda-ex-ceo-\r\ncaroline-ellison-spotted-in-new-york-twitter-users-claim.\r\n46 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 50 of 67\r\nPursuant to this proposed class action settlement and subject to approval from the U.S. Attorney's\r\nOffice, Caroline provided the MDL steering committee with information and documents that\r\nsupported their filing an amended complaint against people and entities that facilitated the FTX\r\nfraud. See, e.g., In re FTX Cryptocurrency Exchange Collapse Litigation, No. 1:23-md-3076 (S.D.\r\nFla. Feb. 16, 2024) Dkt. 492-1 at 115-123 (Declaration of Caroline Ellison Regarding Deltec Bank\r\nand Trust). For instance, Caroline provided the MDL plaintiffs with documents and a declaration\r\ndescribing, in detail, how the Bahamian Deltec Bank and Trust provided Alameda with a\r\nclandestine line of credit of approximately $2 billion. See Ex. AJ (MDL plaintiffs) at 2. Moreover,\r\nin settling, Caroline sought to preserve her assets for disposition through the forfeiture process, as\r\nordered by this Court and administered by the Department of Justice.\r\nCaroline is also in the process of finalizing a settlement with the FTX Debtors of the\r\nadversary proceeding brought against her in the Bankruptcy Court; that settlement will resolve all\r\nthe Debtors' claims against her and will establish a framework for her “ongoing cooperation” with\r\nthe Debtors' litigation, investigation, and asset tracing work. Ex. AI (FTX Debtors) at 2. Under\r\nthe contemplated settlement, Caroline will continue to “mak[e] herself available to testify as\r\nneeded, voluntarily provid[e] documents and information, review[] and clarify[] documents,\r\nlocate[] and retriev[e] assets, and answer[] questions from the Debtors' advisors.\" Id. In\r\nconnection with this agreement, Caroline anticipates that the FTX Debtors may soon notice her\r\ndeposition in multiple adversary proceedings regarding companies into which Mr. Bankman-Fried\r\nmade \"venture\" investments via Alameda Research entities.\r\nCaroline has similarly assisted the independent examiner appointed by the FTX\r\nBankruptcy Court, including by voluntarily sitting for multiple interviews about Alameda\r\nResearch and its relationship to FTX.US. See Ex. AK (FTX Bankruptcy Examiner). Caroline also\r\n47 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 51 of 67\r\nprovided information to the New York Attorney General's Investor Protection Bureau to assist\r\nwith a crypto-related investigation. And throughout this case, Caroline has provided information\r\nto the SEC and CFTC to assist their investigations of regulatory violations related to\r\ncryptocurrency market manipulation, the FTX fraud, and FTX.US's regulatory compliance.\r\nFinally, Caroline has also met with other prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office and in the\r\nbroader Department of Justice to provide information on other people and entities under\r\ninvestigation, including people who enabled and profited from the FTX fraud, people involved in\r\nrouting Alameda Research's funds into the U.S. campaign finance system, and cryptocurrency\r\nmarket participants involved in other potential criminal activities.\r\nE.\r\nCaroline's Efforts To Rebuild Her Life\r\nSince FTX collapsed in November 2022, Caroline has sought new ways to contribute\r\npositively to society (in addition to her cooperation with investigations of FTX and Alameda\r\nResearch). Caroline's repeated efforts to find a paying job have been unsuccessful because of her\r\nnotoriety and the uncertainty surrounding her criminal case. Caroline has therefore focused instead\r\non direct service, volunteering more than 700 hours to community organizations,\r\nThroughout 2023, Caroline\r\nshe\r\nvolunteered regularly at a soup kitchen and food pantry, taught adult literacy classes, fostered\r\nrescue dogs, served as a volunteer tax preparer for low-income taxpayers, and helped to deliver\r\nmeals to individuals with chronic illnesses. See Ex. AG\r\nA (S. Ellison), F (M. Dinsmore) at 1-2; PSR ¶79.\r\n); see also Exs. B (G. Ellison),\r\nCaroline has volunteered\r\nat least weekly at various organizations to assist low-income people with income tax preparation,\r\nto provide GED tutoring in math, to send books to prisoners, and to distribute groceries at a local\r\nfood pantry. See Exs. AH\r\n), AF\r\n48\r\n48\r\nΕΙ\r\nat 1; Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 52 of 67\r\nPSR 179.\r\nothers:\r\ndescribes her evident passion for performing this direct service to\r\nIt has been very good to see Caroline involved in these grounded, positive impact activities.\r\nI do not claim to understand everything that went wrong at Alameda and FTX, but it seems\r\nclear to me that the extreme level of abstraction was a catalyst for bad decisions. Spending\r\ntime face-to-face with and befriending real, concrete people that don't necessarily have\r\nexactly the same background as her has obviously been very healing.\r\nEx. E\r\nat 1.\r\nCaroline has also spent a significant amount of time writing. In particular, she has\r\ncollaborated with her parents and another professor on a math enrichment textbook for advanced\r\nhigh school students. See Exs. B (G. Ellison) at 4, A (S. Ellison), AB (C. Avery). Caroline has\r\nalso written a novel (unrelated to the facts of this case). See Ex. A (S. Ellison) at 5.\r\nSince Alameda Research collapsed, Caroline has been fortunate to draw on a stable and\r\nloving support network, including her family and many friends from childhood, who had lost touch\r\nwith her while she was employed at Alameda Research, see, e.g., Ex. F (M. Dinsmore). Caroline\r\nhas also drawn comfort from a new partner,\r\nPSR 76-77. Caroline's friends recognize her\r\nnew partner as supportive and a positive, grounding influence:\r\nV.\r\nIn October 2022, I learned that Caroline was dating a close friend of mine, someone I had\r\nknown for five years. I was very happy for her. I said that he was a vast improvement\r\nover her ex. I was being sardonic and genuine. Her new partner is honest and has integrity;\r\nhe finds even the small white lies of corporate politics distasteful. I have known him to be\r\nkind, intelligent and empathetic. He has quietly supported her this last year. I believe that\r\nthis new and kind environment will be good for her.\r\nEx. G (L. Clark) at 3.\r\nTHE SENTENCING GUIDELINES AND PROBATION'S RECOMMENDATION\r\nCaroline does not object to the Guidelines calculation of offense level 43 with a criminal\r\nhistory level of I, as set forth in the presentence report. Of the 43 offense level points, 30 levels\r\nare attributable solely to the loss table. See PSR ¶55. As the Court has noted “there's really no\r\n49 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 53 of 67\r\nempirical basis” for the loss table's structure and the Court is not “in any way bound\" by the\r\nGuidelines calculation. Dkt. 426 at 6:19-23 (Bankman-Fried sentencing). Indeed, even setting\r\naside the issue of cooperation, the Court “may not presume that the Guidelines range is\r\nreasonable.\" Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 50 (2007). Here, the Guidelines sentence of life\r\nimprisonment, reduced to the statutory maximum of 1,320 months, is eminently unreasonable.\r\nNotwithstanding the astronomical Guidelines range, the Probation Department's PSR\r\nrecommends a sentence of time served on each of the counts, and a three-year term of supervised\r\nrelease on each count, all to run concurrently. See PSR at 40. The Probation Department does not\r\nrecommend imposing a fine. See id.\r\nVI.\r\nA SENTENCE OF TIME SERVED IS SUFFICIENT TO COMPLY WITH SECTION 3553(A)\r\nThe Court's sentencing decision must “consider all of the § 3553(a) factors to determine\r\nwhether they support the sentence requested by a party.” Gall, 552 U.S. at 49-50. These factors\r\ninclude:\r\n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the\r\ndefendant;\r\n(2) the need for the sentence imposed\r\nA. to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to\r\nprovide just punishment for the offense;\r\nB. to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\r\nC. to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and\r\nD. to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,\r\nmedical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;\r\n(3) the kinds of sentences available;\r\n(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established [by the United States\r\nSentencing Guidelines];\r\n(5) any pertinent policy statement [issued by the Sentencing Commission];\r\n(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar\r\nrecords who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and\r\n(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\r\n50 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 54 of 67\r\nIn considering these factors, the Court must make an independent sentencing determination based\r\non “an individualized assessment based on the facts presented,” Gall, 552 U.S. at 49-50, and\r\nimpose a sentence that is “sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with” these factors,\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\r\nCaroline is acutely aware that “this was a very serious crime,” and she recognizes that\r\njustice demands that for each defendant, “the judgment has to adequately reflect th[at]\r\nseriousness.\" Dkt. 426 at 56:18-20 (Bankman-Fried sentencing). Indeed, Caroline was the first\r\nperson in this saga to accept responsibility for their crimes, doing so even before FTX had declared\r\nbankruptcy, and she has repeatedly expressed intense remorse for her role. See, e.g., supra pp.37,\r\n41. Telling the truth in that Alameda Research all-hands meeting enabled Caroline to extricate\r\nherself from the \"trap[]\" of Mr. Bankman-Fried's influence, Tr.1096:20, and Caroline jumped\r\nwholeheartedly into helping to bring victims compensation and justice for the harm she and her\r\nco-conspirators have caused.\r\nIt is therefore respectfully submitted that, in light of Caroline's immediate and\r\nextraordinary cooperation in this case, as well as her personal history and the mitigating factors\r\nconcerning her role in the offense, sentencing Caroline to time served with a term of supervised\r\nrelease would be “sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to achieve the objectives of the section\r\n3553(a) sentencing factors.\r\nA.\r\nCaroline's Personal History and Characteristics\r\nCaroline's friends, family members, and former colleagues uniformly recognize Caroline\r\nto be a generous, loyal, and conscientious person who thinks deeply about how she can act ethically\r\nto have a positive effect on the world. Prior to working at Alameda Research, Caroline does not\r\nappear ever to have been in any trouble, whether at home, school, or work. See, e.g., PSR ¶88\r\n51 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 55 of 67\r\n(\"Ellison... [has] never had any disciplinary issues.\"); id. ¶¶66-71 (reflecting no prior criminal\r\njustice involvement). The attached letters brim with testimonials to and examples of Caroline\r\nacting in a kind and unselfish manner toward her colleagues, her friends, and the world at large.\r\nSee generally supra pp.6-12.\r\nThe letters also confirm Caroline's commitment to utilitarian ethical principles, and they\r\ndescribe behaviors reflecting that she understands utilitarianism to require generosity and self-\r\nsacrifice, not as a justification to self-aggrandizement or dishonesty. A former colleague recalls a\r\nsmall example of Caroline's sincerity:\r\nI've spent many nights trying to reconcile the person I know with what I've learned about\r\nCaroline during the criminal proceedings. Looking back, I conclude that she valued her\r\nown feelings and desires too little. Why else would she work all those night shifts? Once,\r\nher great-uncle took us on a tour of Napa Valley in his vintage four-seater Cessna. Before\r\nI could say anything, she eagerly jumped into the back and offered me the front seat. She\r\nknew that I loved small airplanes. She said it was the utilitarian thing to do, since I\r\nwould enjoy the [seat] more.\r\nEx. G (L. Clark) at 2-3 (emphasis added).\r\nThe record uniformly supports Caroline's testimony that she joined Alameda Research in the first\r\nplace principally from a desire to earn money to give to charity, not a desire to live an extravagant\r\nlife, accumulate personal wealth, burnish her public persona, or obtain power. See supra pp.15-\r\n16.\r\nIt is a cruel irony that Caroline's zeal to maximize her positive impact on the world led her\r\nto trust and to follow Mr. Bankman-Fried, who attracted Caroline in significant part through his\r\nespousal of EA principals and his deployment of utilitarian arguments. At Mr. Bankman-Fried's\r\nsentencing, the Court rightly criticized him for treating the world like a “game,” for “betting on\r\nexpected value,” and for “viewing the cost of getting caught, discounted by probability ... against\r\nthe gain of getting away without getting caught.\" Dkt. 426 at 53:16-22. Caroline does not share\r\nhis worldview. Unlike Mr. Bankman-Fried, Caroline has never suggested that utilitarianism\r\n52 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 56 of 67\r\njustifies lying or stealing, and she always thought that his professed “risk neutrality” was\r\ndangerous and counseled Mr. Bankman-Fried not to take such extreme risks. See, e.g., Tr.807:8-\r\n809:2, Tr.973-974.\r\nCaroline never adopted Mr. Bankman-Fried's ethical views―debating these philosophical\r\nissues was a fixture of their time together-but their multifaceted relationship undoubtedly\r\ninfluenced her. After repeatedly advising Mr. Bankman-Fried not to take certain risks and then\r\nwatching them work out—e.g., building FTX, investing in Solana—Caroline came to increasingly\r\ndefer to his judgment, even when she knew that what he was proposing was wrong. Her sister\r\ndescribes Caroline as having been “almost in awe of how smart he was,” and “[s]he always\r\ndeferred to him a good deal, both because he was in reality very smart, and also ... because he was\r\nso good with words, with coming up with arguments quickly and making Caroline feel irrational\r\nif she disagreed.\" Ex. C (A. Ellison) at 3. As Caroline testified, working with Mr. Bankman-Fried\r\n\"made me more willing to do things like lie and steal over time.” Tr.807:22-23. She continued:\r\n“When I started working at Alameda, I don't think I would have believed it if you told me that a\r\nfew years later I would be sending false balance sheets to our lenders or taking customer money,\r\nbut over time it was something that I became more comfortable with when I was working there.\"\r\nTr.807:23-808:2.\r\nCaroline's honest explanation of the FTX and Alameda Research fraud during the\r\nNovember 9, 2022 all hands meeting represents not just a pivotal moment in this case—her\r\nrenunciation of Mr. Bankman-Fried's conspiracy and the beginning of her acceptance of\r\nresponsibility and cooperation with the appropriate authorities. It is a signal moment in Caroline's\r\nlife and represents her return to the honest and law-abiding life she led before joining Alameda\r\nResearch.\r\n53\r\n53 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 57 of 67\r\nB. Nature, Characteristics of the Offense\r\nCaroline served as co-CEO, then CEO of Alameda Research. But her title belied her actual\r\nauthority. As the Court remarked at a sidebar shortly after Caroline left the stand, there was\r\n\"absolutely no doubt [that Mr. Bankman-Fried] owned the company,\" and the evidence was\r\noverwhelming that Caroline, “the ostensible co-CEO or CEO, r[an] all these decisions through\r\nhim. He was obviously the boss.\" Tr.1129:3-6. The government proved at trial that Caroline's\r\n\"CEO\" title was an aspect of Mr. Bankman-Fried's fraudulent scheme. Specifically, in summer\r\n2021, Mr. Bankman-Fried concluded that “it was important to separate Alameda and FTX more\r\noptically and not have him be too officially associated with Alameda,” so he appointed Caroline\r\nto be the public face of Alameda Research as co-CEO. Tr.683:16-18. Caroline continued to\r\n\"handle[] a lot of day-to-day decisions and responsibilities” for Alameda's market making and\r\nproprietary trading businesses, but Caroline \"would always ultimately defer to [Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried] if he thought that [Alameda] should do something.” Tr.687:6-9.\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried unilaterally ran the aspect of Alameda's business that most directly\r\nled to its crisis. As Caroline testified, Mr. Bankman-Fried told Caroline in late 2021 “that he was\r\nthinking of making $3 billion more of venture investments,\" funded by billions more in open-term\r\nloans from third-party lending desks. Tr.703:9-11. Caroline performed a scenario analysis,\r\nembodied in a spreadsheet titled \"NAV Minus SamCoins,” GX36, and concluded that “making $3\r\nbillion more of venture investments and funding that with open-term loans would put Alameda in\r\na significantly riskier position and make it much less likely or almost impossible that we would be\r\nable to pay off [its] loans if all of [the] loans were called at once.” Tr.703:18-22. The analysis\r\nassumed that in such a scenario, “Alameda would take FTX customer funds, if they were available,\r\nto repay [its] loans.\" Tr.705:9-10. Caroline advised Mr. Bankman-Fried that even if Alameda\r\n54\r\n54 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 58 of 67\r\nResearch were to take FTX customer funds, “there was no way we would be able to\" repay the\r\nloans. Tr.725:19-20. Mr. Bankman-Fried did not dispute Caroline's conclusions, but \"he said that\r\nhe wanted to do it” because “it was high expected value,” Tr.704:25-705:1.\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried and the \"FTX Ventures” team implemented this plan in 2021-2022 by\r\nrouting FTX customer funds and the proceeds of open-term loans through Alameda Research and\r\ninto \"several entities that had Alameda in the name.\" Tr.869:15-20. Nevertheless, Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried called the investment fund “FTX Ventures\" because “he wanted to associate himself more\r\nwith the venture investing but he didn't want his name associated with Alameda's name.\"\r\nTr.731:19-25. Caroline was not (to her knowledge) an officer of most of those \"ventures\" entities,\r\nand she generally had no material involvement (and no actual decision-making authority) over the\r\nbillions of dollars in “ventures”-related spending from Alameda's coffers. Indeed, Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried and his FTX Ventures team stonewalled for months Caroline's requests for information on\r\nwhat these funds had even been used for, leading her to undertake in the summer and fall of 2022\r\nan effort “to track loans that were made by Alameda to related parties and entities.” Tr.889:21-\r\n22. Through her effort, Caroline and her team tracked down more than $8 billion in payments\r\nfrom Alameda Research to those ventures-related entities, companies Mr. Bankman-Fried had\r\ndecided to acquire, political lobbying organizations, and FTX executives—billions of dollars to\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried and entities he controlled, hundreds of millions of dollars each to Mr. Singh\r\nand Mr. Wang, and $35 million to Ryan Salame. See Tr.889-891; GX41.\r\nCaroline did not take any such loans from Alameda Research. 14 Nor did Caroline\r\npersonally receive ownership of any supposed “venture” investments. Compare, e.g., Tr.640:14-\r\n14 A $3.5 million loan from Alameda was made in Caroline's name “for a gambling\r\ncompany that some people at FTX wanted to start,\" and she \"never really saw or used the money,\"\r\nbecause \"[i]t went straight to this gambling company.\" Tr.689:1-7.\r\n55 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 59 of 67\r\n17 (Wang); but see supra n.14. These facts distinguish Caroline from all the other defendants\r\nindicted in connection with the crimes committed at Alameda Research and FTX. See Tr.688:18-\r\n689:7; GX41 (spreadsheet listing intercompany and founder loans). All of Caroline's\r\ncompensation during her time at Alameda Research was paid to her at Mr. Bankman-Fried's\r\ndiscretion. Caroline did not pay herself any compensation or use corporate funds to purchase any\r\nassets for herself. And Mr. Bankman-Fried pointedly refused to allow Caroline to acquire any\r\nequity in Alameda Research, which was at all relevant times owned entirely by Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried and Mr. Wang. See Tr.685:23-686:8.\r\nCaroline also was not charged with participating in the campaign finance conspiracy\r\nalongside Mr. Bankman-Fried, Mr. Salame, and Mr. Singh. See generally Dkt. 8 (indictment).\r\nThat distinction reflects that Caroline did not make any political donations on behalf of others, and\r\nshe did not direct Alameda to fund any political donations on her behalf.\r\nAs the government argued in closing, Mr. Bankman-Fried's “relationship with Caroline ...\r\nwas important... to understand why he chose her as his front and as his deputy”: She was \"[h]is\r\ngirlfriend, the person who deferred to him...—in that relationship [Mr. Bankman-Fried] had all\r\nthe power.\" Tr.3123:11-16 (rebuttal summation). Caroline testified about how their \"personal\r\nand professional relationships affect[ed] each other,” and that she was “an unequal partner in\r\n[their] relationship” because “the whole time [they] were dating he was also [her] boss at work.\"\r\nTr.684:13-14, 934:14-21.\r\nCaroline was also woefully (and obviously) unprepared to take on the responsibilities of\r\nrunning a multi-billion-dollar trading firm. Before starting at Alameda (at age twenty-three),\r\nCaroline's only prior full-time job was as an entry-level trader at Jane Street. See supra pp.12-14.\r\nAt Jane Street, Caroline had no experience supervising employees, handling client funds,\r\n56 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 60 of 67\r\nallocating proprietary capital, managing financial risks, negotiating loan agreements, preparing\r\nfinancial reports, or assessing legal compliance. See id. Nor did Caroline—who studied highly\r\nabstract mathematics, linguistics, and computer science- -ever receive any formal training in\r\nbusiness, law, compliance, or risk management beyond basic introductory sessions offered to all\r\nnew hires at Jane Street. Caroline's relative ignorance on these topics was obviously unhelpful\r\nwhen she faced pressure from Mr. Bankman-Fried to further and to conceal his illegality.\r\nMr. Bankman-Fried exacerbated this situation by refusing to provide Caroline and her co-\r\nCEO, Mr. Trabucco, with any personnel or resources that would have helped them assess Mr.\r\nBankman-Fried's problematic instructions. For instance, when Caroline and Mr. Trabucco hired\r\na lawyer from outside the company to serve as Alameda Research's general counsel, Daniel\r\nFriedberg fired the attorney (on what Caroline understood to be Mr. Bankman-Fried's behalf) a\r\nfew days after he arrived in the Bahamas, because that attorney had raised questions about the\r\nlinks between Alameda Research and FTX. See First Amended Complaint, Alameda Research\r\nLLC v. Friedberg, No. 23-AP-50419-JTD (Bankr. D. Del. Jan. 22, 2024) ¶¶181-184. Caroline\r\nalso recalls that Mr. Bankman-Fried would react negatively when an employee expressed fear or\r\nraised concerns about legal issues, isolating that person by cutting him or her out of important\r\nconversations and chat threads. Having seen this dynamic play out repeatedly, Caroline worried\r\nthat if she questioned Mr. Bankman-Fried about what they were doing, he would cut her out of his\r\nlife and companies in the same way.\r\nCaroline has never wavered in accepting responsibility for what she did at Alameda\r\nResearch and has always “truthfully admitted the conduct comprising the offense[s] of conviction\r\nand truthfully admitted ... additional relevant conduct.\" United States v. Singh, 877 F.3d 107, 120\r\n(2d Cir. 2017). Mr. Bankman-Fried did not coerce Caroline to commit crimes on his behalf, and\r\n57 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 61 of 67\r\nCaroline could have refused to follow Mr. Bankman-Fried's directions. However, Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried's decision to install Caroline as the putative co-CEO of Alameda Research and his\r\nexploitation of his emotional power and corporate authority are relevant context in understanding\r\nCaroline's participation in these crimes.\r\nC.\r\nAffording Adequate Deterrence to Criminal Conduct and Protecting the\r\nPublic from Further Crimes by the Defendant\r\nCaroline's participation in the criminal conspiracies at Alameda Research is a dramatic\r\ndeparture from her otherwise law-abiding nature. She poses no risk of recidivism. Sending\r\nCaroline to prison is entirely unnecessary, either for specific deterrence or to safeguard the public.\r\nCaroline is unlikely to reoffend because she did not commit these crimes out of greed. The\r\nmost powerful evidence that Caroline did not act from avarice is that she did nothing to protect\r\nherself from the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research, even though she knew as well as anyone\r\nbut Mr. Bankman-Fried what was likely to happen. Although Caroline was aware for years that\r\nAlameda Research was secretly using FTX customer funds, she nevertheless kept substantially all\r\nher assets in her FTX.com user account. Strikingly, Caroline never transferred any of her holdings\r\noff of FTX.com after June 2022, by which point she knew that Alameda Research likely could not\r\npay back its FTX.com “borrowing.” Nor did Caroline make any significant purchases after (or\r\nbefore) that point (other than the Anthropic investment, made in early 2022 to advance AI safety).\r\nCaroline declined to protect her own funds from FTX's collapse because she believed it would be\r\nunfair to shield herself while FTX's customers' funds were in danger.\r\nCaroline similarly could have insulated herself from criminal jeopardy had she left\r\nAlameda Research after she broke up with Mr. Bankman-Fried in late April 2022. To that point,\r\nCaroline was similarly situated with her co-CEO, Mr. Trabucco, who has never been charged. But\r\nCaroline stayed not out of greed, but out of misplaced duty, believing Mr. Bankman-Fried’s\r\n58\r\n58 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 62 of 67\r\nwarning that her departure might precipitate a crisis of confidence in Alameda Research—and by\r\nextension, in FTX. Caroline's sister recalls her describing her reasons for staying, even though\r\n\"she would often cry about how overwhelmed she felt:\r\nFirst, if she had left, either someone else would have been saddled with all of the work she\r\nhad, or the company would have completely fallen apart.... From an outsider's\r\nperspective, it seemed like she should prioritize her own happiness and leave the company\r\nbehind, but she viewed the company and the others there as just as important, and ... she\r\nfelt she would be betraying her friends if she did leave.\r\nEx. C (A. Ellison) at 2.\r\nCaroline's reasons for staying obviously do not absolve the criminal acts she took as Alameda\r\nResearch sank further into financial oblivion. Yet her reasons for staying should inform whether\r\nshe acted from greed, lust for power, or another motivation that creates a risk she would reoffend.\r\nFinally, Caroline's settlements with the SEC and CFTC-not to mention her ruined\r\nreputation further reduce the need to incarcerate her to protect the public or achieve specific\r\ndeterrence. See United States v. Adelson, 441 F.Supp.2d 506, 514 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (holding that\r\na \"reputation ruined by ... conviction\" and a bar on serving as a public company officer or director\r\nreduce the need to incarcerate a fraud defendant to achieve specific deterrence). Pursuant to those\r\nsettlements, Caroline is barred for life from working in the traditional finance industry or trading\r\ncryptocurrencies on behalf of anyone else. See supra pp.41-42. Caroline is also banned from\r\nserving as an officer of any public company. These regulatory judgments therefore make it\r\nexceedingly unlikely that Caroline could ever again occupy a position of trust where she could\r\ncommit another financial crime.\r\n59 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 63 of 67\r\nD.\r\nReflecting the Seriousness of the Offense, Promoting Respect for the Law,\r\nProviding Just Punishment and Compensation for Victims, and Avoiding\r\nUnwarranted Sentencing Disparities\r\nAs the Court observed in sentencing Mr. Bankman-Fried, the fraud committed at FTX and\r\nAlameda Research “was a very serious crime.” Dkt. 426 at 56:19-20. Caroline has never sought\r\nto minimize its harm or her role.\r\nThe evidence shows that Caroline was not motivated by greed and did not take steps to\r\npersonally profit at the expense of customers. Unlike others, she held no equity in Alameda, almost\r\nno equity in FTX, did not take substantial personal loans to obtain equity stakes in venture\r\ninvestments, and did not misuse corporate funds for political contributions in an effort to become\r\npolitically powerful. Unlike others, Caroline never bought real estate, yachts, or other luxury\r\ngoods using her own funds, let alone Alameda or FTX's money. And critically, after Caroline\r\nlearned that Alameda's borrowing would likely lead to distress at FTX, she did not withdraw any\r\nmoney from her FTX.com user account. In doing so, Caroline consciously left herself vulnerable\r\nto losing almost all of her savings generated while working at Alameda Research—just like FTX\r\ncustomers.\r\nOnce settlements with the government and the FTX Debtors are finalized, Caroline expects\r\nshe will not retain any financial benefit she obtained from working at Alameda Research. This\r\nconstitutes a significant punishment, since “[i]n the case of financial fraud, ….. an important kind\r\nof retribution may be achieved through the imposition of financial burdens.” Adelson, 441 F. Supp.\r\n2d at 514. Through her anticipated settlement with the FTX Debtors, Caroline will also surrender\r\nany claim to the assets held in her FTX.com customer account, so unlike ordinary FTX customers\r\nwho will receive more than 100 cents on the dollar for their petition-date account balances, she\r\nwill recover nothing through the bankruptcy process. Caroline also has no reasonable prospect of\r\n60\r\n60 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 64 of 67\r\nrebuilding her financial position. She has been rendered effectively unemployable in the near term\r\nby the notoriety arising from this case, and the reputational harm is not likely to abate any time\r\nsoon. And through her civil settlements with the SEC and CFTC, Caroline has accepted lifetime\r\nbans from the only industries she has ever worked in: finance and crypto. These personal,\r\nfinancial, and career consequences constitute substantial forms of punishment that reduce the need\r\nfor the Court to order her incarceration.\r\nFinally, sentencing Caroline to time served would promote respect for the law, because it\r\nwould incentivize people involved in a fraud to do what Caroline did: publicly disclose a fraud,\r\nimmediately accept responsibility, and cooperate immediately with civil and criminal authorities.\r\nThe Court has already communicated the seriousness of these crimes in sentencing Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried and Mr. Salame, and it remains to sentence Mr. Wang and Mr. Singh, who were partners\r\nwith Mr. Bankman-Fried in owning and operating FTX.com. But Caroline “provide[d] important\r\ninformation for ongoing investigations and ... furnish[ed] the most damaging testimony against\r\nthe accused at trial, ... which [wa]s key to winning convictions\" of other FTX executives. United\r\nStates v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 787 (2d Cir. 1996). In recognition of Caroline's substantial\r\nassistance, the Probation Department has accordingly recommended a non-custodial sentence for\r\nCaroline. While this case is distinct in the size of the fraud, this Court has repeatedly sentenced\r\ncooperators in significant fraud cases to time served or other non-custodial sentences in recognition\r\nof \"the considerable value of [their] cooperation with the government,” where it was \"was\r\nessential... to making th[e fraud] case, and [so] served a real public interest.” United States v.\r\nGassnola, No. 1:18:cr-252-LAK (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 2019) Dkt. 24 at 10:15-18 (sentencing fraud\r\ncooperator to time served with two months' home detention); see also, e.g., United States v.\r\nMakov, No. 1:05-cr-888-LAK (S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2010) Dkt. 1495 (sentencing to probation a\r\n61 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 65 of 67\r\ncooperator, who paid $10 million in forfeiture, was cross examined at trial for two days, and who\r\nwas a partner in a business that sold illegal tax shelters, where co-defendants were sentenced to as\r\nmuch as 10 years' incarceration); United States v. Fogel, No. 1:17-cr-308-LAK (S.D.N.Y. Nov.\r\n27, 2018) Dkt. 83 (sentencing to time served a cooperator in an insider trading case); United States\r\nv. Silvestre, No. 1:14-cr-72-LAK (S.D.N.Y. Feb 23, 2014) Dkt. 24 (sentencing to time served a\r\ncooperator in a “very serious” health care fraud whose cooperation “started right away\" and was\r\n\"extraordinarily valuable\"). Moreover, because many other cooperators in complex fraud cases\r\nhave received time-served sentences in this district, a non-custodial sentence would not create any\r\nunwarranted disparities.\r\nVII.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Probation Department has recommended that the Court sentence Caroline to time\r\nserved with a period of supervised release. In light of Caroline's contrition, her immediate and\r\ncomplete acceptance of responsibility, her extraordinarily impactful cooperation-with the U.S.\r\nAttorney's Office, with the SEC and CFTC, with the FTX Debtors, with the MDL plaintiffs, and\r\nwith other official investigations—and her three days of credible testimony at Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried's trial, the section 3553(a) sentencing factors do not require sending Caroline to prison.\r\nRather, a sentence of time served with a period of supervised release would be sufficient, but not\r\ngreater than necessary to fulfill the objectives of sentencing.\r\nDated: New York, New York\r\nSeptember 10, 2024\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n/s/ Anjan Sahni\r\nAnjan Sahni\r\nStephanie Avakian\r\nPeter G.

I've written them for high\r\nschool students, college students, PhD students, colleagues. I have written them for job\r\napplications, college applications, scholarships, internships, award nominations. Some\r\nhave stretched on for pages, with tremendous detail. Some are short but nuanced. Some\r\nare emphatic. Some heartfelt. This one is by far the most difficult I have ever written. I\r\nhave been stewing over it for months, not sure whether Caroline would even ask me―what\r\nwould a judge expect a mother to say in such a circumstance, after all?—but hopeful that\r\nshe would afford me an opportunity to help her in this very small way. And I thank you,\r\nJudge Kaplan, for your attention to this over-long letter. Do understand that I tried to edit it\r\ndown, but every part seemed like an important piece in understanding who Caroline is and\r\nhow I see her. And know, also, that I have longed to have a voice for the past year, to\r\nprotect and defend Caroline, but knew that any public statements could backfire\r\nspectacularly. So I held my tongue.\r\nLet me start, predictably, at the beginning. Caroline did not come easily. Month after\r\ndisappointing month went by without success in our attempts to start our family. I prayed\r\nand cried and prayed some more, considering adoption, wondering whether my life could\r\nbe full without children. After surgery and several more months of fertility treatments, I\r\nwas pregnant (and overjoyed and very sick to my stomach). The weight of all of those\r\nhopes and dreams was a lot to place on a little baby, I know, but she was perfect. And as\r\nshe grew, we could not believe how perfect she continued to be. As a baby and toddler,\r\ntemper tantrums were non-existent. We took her everywhere with us—to grown-up\r\nrestaurants where she sat quietly in her car seat while we ate dinner, on trips abroad,\r\nwhere she played in the local playgrounds or hiked along ancient walls or to monuments\r\nwith us, even to concerts and the theater (!) where she said quietly mesmerized by the\r\naction on stage, too young to clearly articulate her thoughts but obviously very engaged\r\nand interested.\r\nWe remember her first word, \"duck,\" her first joke, \"ma-da,\" used as a single word to\r\ndenote both of her parents simultaneously, her proto-language she constructed because\r\nher imperative to communicate outstripped her young mouth's ability to form sounds, and\r\none of her first phrases, betraying an essential aspect of her personality, \"by self.\"\r\n\"Caroline, let me help you with that.\" \"No, by self,\" was the typical response, often\r\nemphatically. We nicknamed her the \"by-self baby.\" Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 5 of 115\r\nHer precocity was the stuff of family legend. We taught her to read at about 2 1/2 so she\r\ncould keep herself busy when we were preoccupied by a new baby on the way. She was\r\nreading novels by 4 and had surpassed me in reading speed and comprehension by\r\n5. (Trust me on this—we ran tests to confirm.) She was a voracious reader, and keeping\r\nher in books was difficult and expensive. We were delighted when digital readers become\r\naffordable and commonplace (about the time she was in middle school), helping to\r\nmitigate the problems caused by the sheer volume of books that she needed to always\r\nhave around her. (On trips, we would limit her to the number of books she could fit in her\r\nbackpack. And then, like clockwork, she would exhaust that supply a couple of days into\r\nthe trip and we would spend a chunk of our vacation searching for an English-language\r\nbookstore to replenish her supply.) She read everything she could get her hands on, from\r\nliterary fiction to YA fiction to science fiction, from philosophy to history to sociology to\r\npopular science.\r\nReading was always her passion, so we were surprised and pleased when she developed a\r\nkeen interest in math in fourth and fifth grades. She loved tackling difficult problems and\r\nloved discussing their solutions with us. Glenn could not have been happier and spent\r\nhours with her talking through logic puzzles, teaching her rudimentary programming to\r\nsolve the more difficult ones, guiding her towards her own solutions, often clever\r\nalternatives to standard ones. She begged for over a year to be enrolled in an after-school\r\nmath enrichment class. We kept putting her off because we feared overscheduling her and\r\ncrowding out just being a kid. (She was always a somewhat shy kid, but she had a nice\r\ngroup of friends, and we wanted to nurture that side of her as well.) We eventually\r\nrelented, and her second passion, mathematics, was well on its way.\r\nHer sisters will write letters to support her as well, but let me just say as an aside that she\r\nwas an extraordinarily positive presence in our home and an extraordinarily good sister to\r\nour two daughters who came later. Anna, about three years behind, and Kate, another six\r\nyears later, always admired and looked up to Caroline, in part because of her remarkable\r\naccomplishments, but also because of her love and kindness and nurturing towards\r\nthem. The arguments, the grumpiness, the rancor, the normal everyday stuff in a family\r\nwith three kids (especially when some of them are teenagers) were largely absent. I'm not\r\nsure if there was anything Glenn and I did to achieve this. In large part, I think it was due to\r\nthe example Caroline set for her sisters: always be kind, keep your emotions in check,\r\nwork towards the common good. The love, support, and closeness they have achieved in\r\nthis past year has given me hope and solace in this most challenging of times.\r\nCaroline in high school worked hard, achieved amazing things, had close and kind and\r\nlovely friends, continued to be a cheerful and positive presence at home. Her best friend\r\nendured a suicide at home sophomore year, and Caroline was there for her, offering the\r\nwarmth and support and willing ear that her friend so desperately needed. Another friend\r\nhad a challenging home life, and she, like the first, was a constant fixture in our house,\r\noften doing homework after school with Caroline, cooking dinner together, staying to eat\r\nwith the family. We gave Caroline tremendous freedom and latitude to do what she Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 6 of 115\r\nthought best: she had earned our trust with her maturity, level-headedness, and overall\r\ngood sense. In any case, she had grown from a “by-self baby” to a “by-self teenager” and\r\nhad a strong independent streak.\r\nWhen she was 16 years old, she approached us with a request. She had been studying\r\nMandarin Chinese in school since 7th grade and was able to read and write decently well.\r\nShe thought her conversational skills were poor, though, and she asked if we would send\r\nher to an immersion school in China over the summer. After some investigation, we\r\ndiscovered that there seemed to be two types of Chinese language immersion schools,\r\nones designed for young Chinese children adopted into Western families and ones\r\ndesigned for adults, perhaps learning Chinese for professional reasons. Neither seemed\r\nappropriate, but the second seemed much better than the first. So, without a second\r\nthought, we enrolled her in a three-week language program in Beijing with adults from\r\naround the world. She flew there herself, navigated the subway and bus system on her\r\nown, went to restaurants, toured historical sites, and markedly improved her\r\nconversational Mandarin. And we knew that, after such an experience, going off to college\r\nthe next year would be a cakewalk.\r\nSimilarly, she was an extraordinarily good student at college, and made another set of\r\nclose and kind and lovely friends. (By the way, I am comforted by the fact that most of her\r\nclose friends from high school and college have stuck by her and been an invaluable\r\nsupport system for her this past year.) She called us often and visited when she could. We\r\nalways enjoyed hearing about the classes she was taking, the dances that she and her\r\nfriends went to, the meals they cooked, the trips to SF, plans for her future—all of the\r\nnormal stuff of college. It was also during college that she became increasingly involved\r\nwith various charities and started making substantial contributions to a number of them.\r\nShe had always had a very strong moral compass and believed that it was imperative that\r\nshe use her substantial skills to help mankind and make the world a better place. We were\r\nnot surprised that, even as a college student, she would take from her surplus to donate to\r\nothers.\r\nMy husband and I also have, I believe, a strong moral compass, and we worked to instill a set of\r\nessential values in Caroline and our other daughters. The guiding principle of my life is to treat\r\nothers with the kindness and respect with which I would want to be treated. My husband and I\r\nstrive to donate substantial amounts of money each year to worthy charities-tutoring\r\nprograms for the disadvantaged, medical research, civic and cultural and educational\r\norganizations. We have both volunteered hundreds (thousands?) of hours and expertise many,\r\nmany times in many settings over the years. We chose careers, as researchers and teachers,\r\nthat we thought would have a chance of making the world a better place. I try to always be\r\ngenerous with my time if a colleague or student or anyone, really, asks for my help, even if much\r\nof that generosity is not required or even expected of me. You could say that I am a straight\r\narrow, but, even more than that, I am someone who has always tried to do things that make the\r\nworld a better place, especially for people less privileged than I am. Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 7 of 115\r\nBut it became clear that I could not hold a candle to Caroline.\r\nWhere I would like to donate 5% of my income to charity every year, I often fall well short.\r\nCaroline, on the other hand, donated 50% of hers every year that she worked. In fact, she\r\nchose her career explicitly in order to earn more money to donate to worthy charities. I would\r\nlike to be less enamored of nice clothes and beautiful jewelry than I am, but I certainly have\r\nmore of all those things than anyone needs. Caroline, on the other hand, has always shopped\r\nat The Gap, wears a threadbare coat and shoes that are falling apart, and rarely chooses to wear\r\njewelry-she finds it wasteful to spend money on luxuries when there are people in the world\r\nwho do not have enough to eat. (I have, on multiple occasions, felt compelled to buy her a\r\ndecent pair of shoes so that she did not permanently damage her feet, even when her net\r\nworth was so many times mine.) While at Alameda, Caroline did not buy lavish gifts for us or\r\nmuch at all for herself, refusing even to purchase a modest apartment or house when she had\r\nplenty of money, despite our exhortations that she should do it at least to diversify her\r\nportfolio.\r\nAnd I should emphasize that none of this is performative. She does not behave this way for\r\ncredit or accolades or to shame others—she never draws attention to her choices and, in fact,\r\noften operates below the radar. We only know of her charitable contributions, for instance,\r\nbecause occasionally a receipt would arrive in our mail if she did not have a permanent address\r\nto send it to, and we asked her about it. When testifying at Sam's trial, she understood the\r\nimportance of looking polished and professional, but didn't have very many clothes that fit the\r\nbill. Instead of purchasing-I would have happily bought her a suit—she carefully planned\r\noutfits out of her existing stock. They might have been acceptable, but, luckily, someone\r\noffered her more polished hand-me-downs.\r\nShe rarely puts herself or her needs first. When FTX collapsed, her mantra was, \"Mom, don't\r\nworry about me. I'll be fine. Are you ok?\" (I will spend the rest of my life trying to understand\r\nhow someone as good and selfless in so much of her life could end up in the situation she did.)\r\nSince her college years, Glenn and I have not always agreed with all of her choices. In particular,\r\nwe wanted her to choose a career that she would enjoy and that would have direct positive\r\nimpacts on others, instead of choosing one to maximize her income in order to maximize her\r\ncharitable contributions. Although I have not always agreed with her unconventional choices, I\r\nnever for a moment doubted her motives. I know, as well as I know anything, that her primary\r\ngoal, her reason to be, was to use her impressive skills to make the world a better place. As you\r\nknow, things went terribly wrong. That fact is heartbreaking enough, but the profound sadness\r\nI feel at having a daughter in these circumstances is compounded many-fold by the stark\r\ncontrast between the life she is facing on the one hand and her moral rectitude and essential\r\ngoodness in so much of her life on the other.\r\nRemarkably, despite this shocking, horrifying turn her life has taken, I have not heard her\r\nutter a single word of anger or blame directed at anyone. A series of events that could\r\nembitter anyone has done nothing of the sort to Caroline. She is calm and hard-working Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 8 of 115\r\nand grateful as always. As her mother, I, of course, notice that she is a smaller, sadder\r\nversion of her former self, but her core qualities remain.\r\nYou will hear from others about how Caroline has spent her time in the past year or so. I\r\nwill not elaborate on all of her activities, but do want to emphasize how enormously\r\nengaged she has been with her volunteering tasks. In our weekly family FaceTime, she\r\nregales us with stories about the students in her English as a Second Language class, or\r\nhow the students in her Adult Literacy tutorial expressed their gratitude at the Christmas\r\nparty she threw. Again, these tasks are not performance to her. She cares about doing a\r\ngood job and cares about the people she is helping. None of this is surprising to us, of\r\ncourse, but we are heartened by the fact that she is finding so much joy and fulfillment in\r\ndirectly working to help those in need. We are hopeful that these activities will serve as a\r\nmodel for her future career.\r\nShe has been busy with volunteering and preparation for her testimony, but still has been\r\nquite productive otherwise. She has written a charming novella (set in Edwardian England\r\nand loosely based on her sister Kate's imagined amorous exploits, to Kate's great\r\ndelight). She is working on another novel, which we have yet to see. And she has been an\r\nextraordinary contributor to a statistics and data analysis textbook that is being\r\ncoauthored by my husband Glenn, a colleague of ours from Harvard Chris Avery, Caroline,\r\nand myself. Talk of this text has been bouncing around among Chris, Glenn, and me for a\r\ncouple of years now, and we decided to start it in earnest this fall. Then it occurred to me\r\nthat Caroline is a very talented writer, knows the technical material forward and backward,\r\nand may have some extra time. We asked if she might be willing to coauthor it with us and\r\nwere delighted when she agreed.\r\nI had never worked on an academic project with her and frankly didn't know how she would\r\nbe as a colleague. Would her work be up to the standards that we wanted to\r\nmaintain? Would she be pleasant and cooperative as a colleague (not just a\r\ndaughter)? Would she be productive and reliable, especially given the other demands on\r\nher time? Yes, yes, and yes! Her contribution has been utterly invaluable to the\r\nproject. Her chapters are written in a pleasant and readable voice and are clear, correct,\r\nand substantive. And she brings a set of skills to the project that none of the rest of us\r\npossess. (To get a bit into the weeds, her contributions have mostly been to author the\r\nchapters of the book where students are taught the practical skills of data analysis, such\r\nas spreadsheet manipulations and Python programming. She has dug up interesting data\r\nsets and examples, and constructed hands-on exercises, which have contributed\r\nenormously to the appeal and substance of the book. She has also written at least one of\r\nthe more theoretical chapters, also in a super readable and engaging style.) To date, we\r\nhave written about 600 pages of the text, and she has contributed, perhaps, 150-200 of\r\nthose. And the parts she has written are essentially perfect, needing little in the way of\r\nediting from the rest of us. We have every expectation that thousands of future high school\r\nand college students will benefit from the work that she has done this year and that we\r\nhope she will continue to be able to do. Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 9 of 115\r\nI hope all of these bits and pieces of Caroline that I have included here fit together into a\r\nsomewhat complete picture. 1. She is kind, compassionate, and generous. 2. She has\r\ntaken full responsibility for her part in the collapse of FTX and Alameda, not deflecting or\r\nblaming or raging, and even doing everything she can to protect us from bearing any of the\r\nburden. 3. Her primary motivation--for her entire adult life--has been to make the world a\r\nbetter place. 4. She has rare skills and the strong internal motivation to make a real\r\ndifference, if she is allowed to. 5. I, her mother, am not the only person who believes these\r\nthings very strongly.\r\nI was not asked to write supporting letters for any of the other principals involved in the\r\ncollapse of FTX or Alameda, and I do not know any of them well. I was impressed, though, by\r\ntheir kindness and earnest good intentions in our limited interactions. My fondest hope is that\r\nyou will see in them what I saw and exercise mercy in your sentencing decisions. Just as I have\r\nwept for Caroline, I have wept for all of them. I do not wish any of them ill. And, finally, I know\r\nthat their failure has hurt thousands, and my heart breaks for those people as well.\r\nI have been a life-long Catholic. Like many others during the pandemic, my regular\r\nattendance at mass ceased. I was slow finding my way back, for many reasons, but have\r\nbeen spending more time in church pews lately. Just as I prayed and cried and prayed\r\nsome more when Glenn and I were earnestly trying to start our family, I find myself again\r\npraying, crying, praying again, and pleading with God and anyone else who might receive\r\nthose pleas, that you see Caroline as we do and show mercy in your decisions about the\r\nrest of her life.\r\nMost respectfully,\r\nSama hillle\r\nSara Fisher Ellison Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT B\r\nPage 10 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1\r\nFiled 09/10/24\r\nPage 11 of 115\r\nJanuary 8, 2024\r\nHon. Lewis A. Kaplan\r\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan\r\nUnited States Courthouse\r\n500 Pearl Street\r\nNew York, NY 10007-1312\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nThank you so much for letting me submit this letter, and please accept my apologies for its length. I\r\nknow it is longer than it should be and parts are not germane to your decision. However, having no\r\nexperience in anything like this, I didn't know what information you'd want, and it is also hard to resist\r\nwanting to say even more about a daughter who has been such a joy in my life. I appreciate the\r\nopportunity to provide some information about Caroline's life outside of the FTX-Alameda case, to tell\r\nyou why I think the world is better with Caroline able to play an active role, and to ask for your mercy.\r\nWhile it may lead the list of what's non-germane, it's hard to start a portrait of Caroline without noting\r\nwhat a remarkable experience it was to be her parent. At a very young age the rate at which she\r\nabsorbed things was astounding, and even more so was her determination. One example was reading\r\nher bedtime stories. Taking a half hour break from my too-busy life was something I could look forward\r\nto every day until, around the time our second daughter was born, Caroline decided she needed to learn\r\nto read. That former pleasant escape became an excruciating hour-plus of sitting by as she struggled to\r\nsound out word after word after word after word. This period did not last long, not because she gave up\r\nas a normal child would, but because, within a few months of her third birthday, she could read aloud at\r\na normal adult cadence. Over the years one learned to not be surprised by her successes: an 800 on the\r\nCritical Reading SAT as a 13-year-old; top twenty national rankings on the main and Olympiad Math\r\nPrize for Girls contests; the honor of representing the United States at the International Linguistics\r\nOlympiad.\r\nWhile we took pride in Caroline's accomplishments, from a young age we were even more proud of her\r\nremarkable empathy and character. Having a younger sibling is challenging when your parents are\r\nalready very busy, but Caroline took on the role of Anna's protector soon after her birth, creating parts\r\nfor a baby in her fantasy games, and serving as a translator whenever we couldn't figure out what a\r\nslightly older Anna wanted. When toddler Anna took the bookmark out a book Caroline had set aside,\r\nproclaiming \"I hate bookmarks,” the young Caroline's first reaction was to adopt her surrogate parent\r\npersona and explain calmly that tearing out bookmarks hurt others. Anna also features in a family story\r\nthat speaks to integrity: one of the few conflicts we did sometimes have with the girls was over\r\nbathroom breaks on long drives. At one stop, Caroline's grandmother (from a stall) overheard Anna\r\n(who had decided not to try to go to the bathroom this time) telling the seven-year-old Caroline, \"You\r\nknow, we don't always have to do what they tell us.\" Obviously, it was not that disobeying her parents\r\nhad not occurred to Caroline. It was just not in her character to lie to us. Jigsaw puzzles are another\r\nanecdote: somehow the girls decided that it was cheating to look at the picture on a box when doing a\r\njigsaw puzzle, and Caroline would never, ever do it. Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 12 of 115\r\nIn Caroline's middle school and high school years, my math team coaching role gave me the opportunity\r\nto observe Caroline and some of her friends in and out of school. Overhearing them in the back seat on\r\nlong car rides was such a treat. I was so proud of what good kids they were, and so impressed with how\r\nCaroline could connect across social groups and make everyone feel a valued part of a team. The gender\r\nbalance of our teams got some attention, but I think people missed that Caroline played multiple critical\r\nroles: she made other girls from our school want to join, and her generous nature made it natural to\r\ninvite friends from rival schools to practice with us, building the community. Most of our friends have\r\nstruggles at some point in their kids' teen years. We just had none. No teen angst. No concerns\r\nwhatsoever. I don't know if Caroline even got a parking ticket.\r\nYou lose the opportunity to see things up close once kids are away at college, but I did know that\r\nCaroline's closest friends at college were really nice young women, that my former students who had\r\nCaroline in class had good things to say, and that her one big extra-curricular activity was Effective\r\nAltruism (EA). I am not a fan of the whole EA movement. Although I very much agree with the general\r\nprinciple that we should think about the effectiveness of the many things we could do to try to make the\r\nworld better, I also feel that the utilitarian philosophy they've latched onto misses some basic moral\r\nconsiderations, and that completely rethinking how we should do things is unlikely to actually end up\r\ndoing better than making incremental changes. I was a bit shocked when the first tax receipt for a\r\ncharitable contribution a hundred times larger than I would have thought a college student should make\r\narrived in the mail. But I know that the movement has attracted many bright, idealistic young people\r\nwho want to make the world a better place. And for many, Caroline included, it is a deeply held belief.\r\nI know that Caroline got into Alameda with the best of intentions. While in an earlier generation, kids\r\nwho wanted to save the world would join the Peace Corps, the EA movement has convinced many today\r\nthat they should go into finance or tech and become philanthropists. In the pre-FTX days, Alameda was\r\nbasically just a market-making/financial trading company. As a parent I worried a bit about their\r\noperating in a super-risky environment and worried more about the unsustainably hard work they were\r\nputting in. For example, we'd hear from Caroline that she'd been on the trading desk from 8am-4pm\r\nand then worked on algorithms or something else from 4 to midnight. But Caroline seemed fine with the\r\nchaos and the hours and took pride in the charitable contributions she could make. She had a healthy\r\nskepticism about whether crypto would amount to anything, but also felt that there was some chance\r\nthat crypto-based apps might provide something really valuable, e.g. to the many that traditional banks\r\ndon't serve. In the Hong Kong years, our impression remained that the company was a group of nerdy\r\nyoung adults working very long hours and doing little other than commuting between their Hong Kong\r\noffice and apartments. With COVID restrictions we never made it to Hong Kong, but did once visit the\r\nBahamas. There, the super-expensive condo was incongruous with how most in it lived. Caroline would\r\nspend all day and much of the evening at the office sitting at one of the 15-20 desks arranged in a circle\r\na couple feet from each other in a generic office park. In the evening she and her roommates would\r\noften cook and eat together—the Bahamas had few vegetarian options—and then perhaps play some\r\nboardgames or open their computers and continue working. Caroline did take pride in her new Honda\r\nCivic, having never before (or since) had a car, but her phone might have been her second-most valuable\r\npossession.\r\nI realize that this portrait is hard to reconcile with actions Caroline took. I wish I could offer some insight\r\ninto how things went so wrong and how she ended up making the decisions she did, but we, like many\r\nothers, were completely blindsided. Since the collapse, she has been scrupulously following the Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 13 of 115\r\ninstructions she received not to talk about the case with others, including us. We knew she was super-\r\nbusy in the three months in which she served as Alameda's sole CEO, and we continued to worry about\r\nhow long one could keep up such a pace, but it did not seem so unusual. Over the years I'd given her the\r\nstandard parental advice to buy a house, to not leave all her money on the FTX exchange and/or\r\ninvested in FTX-related crypto tokens, etc., as often as it seemed a parent could, but she never took it. I\r\nwonder if perhaps things moved quickly from a situation where FTX seemed like a good investment to a\r\nsituation where she would have felt it was wrong to be taking money out.\r\nSimilarly, I can't offer much insight on her personal relationships. While at other times she'd sometimes\r\nlet us know in our family Facetimes even about first dates, we had no idea that she was involved with\r\nSam until she told us that they'd been in a relationship for about two years. It was only then, a few\r\nmonths before they finally broke up, that we realized that some things—for example, switching from\r\nlooking for a house elsewhere in the Bahamas that she would share with a partially overlapping\r\nroommate group to joining Sam's condo group-were not as they seemed at the time and reflected the\r\nrelationship's on-and-off timeline.\r\nI can offer some firsthand observations on Caroline's state of mind in the immediate aftermath of the\r\nFTX collapse. I knew enough about the economics of bank runs and currency attacks to fear, once it\r\nstarted, that Alameda could be at risk of a catastrophic collapse. When we tried to contact Caroline, she\r\nwas too busy to talk. When we finally got through the day after the bankruptcy, she was in a state I have\r\nnever seen. She is perhaps the strongest person I know. But in that conversation, she just could not stop\r\ncrying, saying multiple times that she \"knew\". I was afraid that something tragic could come of her\r\nmental state, and thought about whether there was anything we could do to help get her home safe\r\nfrom Hong Kong. I latched onto a tiny bit of good news we got through the tears: as she'd stayed up\r\nmost of the night doing whatever she was doing to protect assets after her entire team quit, a\r\nconcerned former employee stayed up with her to keep her company. I will be forever grateful to\r\nwhoever that was.\r\nI was so relieved when Caroline made it home a few days later, especially given that she had gotten\r\nsome sleep on the plane and pulled herself together. At that point, she set up a makeshift home office\r\nand started having multiple calls with the new FTX management. As parents, we urged her to get herself\r\na lawyer and consult with them on what she should or should not be doing with FTX (and otherwise).\r\nBut she said she was too busy to try to get a lawyer right away. She backed out of one late-evening\r\nerrand she was going to run with me, telling me that the bankruptcy team wanted her help with getting\r\nAlameda's crypto into cold storage, even though that's something she had mostly relied on staff for, and\r\nshe'd need to pull another all-nighter. When they cut off contact and fired her a day or two later, she\r\nunderstood completely, but was still disappointed, worried that there was so much that the team taking\r\nover didn't know, and wishing they'd known they could trust that she would help out in any way she\r\ncould to minimize the damage.\r\nThe last year plus has obviously been a huge emotional blow to me and to our family. I remain amazed\r\nat Caroline's personal strength. In her situation I would be struggling to get out of bed and do anything\r\nother than dwell on what I could have done differently, but Caroline is much better at accepting that she\r\ncan't change the past and focusing forward. At times, this strength of hers has been critical to our\r\nfamily, especially my wife, as Caroline has helped reassure us. Although Caroline would have liked to\r\nhave had more success in her post-collapse job search, she has enjoyed the volunteer activities she's Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 14 of 115\r\ndone, enjoyed getting to know the people she's worked with, and seems to have gained perspective.\r\nCaroline has always been most comfortable when she's working hard on something she feels is valuable,\r\nand I'm hopeful that she will get a second chance and make something great of it.\r\nI have actually taken advantage of Caroline's talents in a way that has been the one real bright spot for\r\nme in a very dark year. Growing out of volunteer teaching I did when my kids were younger, I developed\r\nthe hobby of writing math enrichment textbooks for the types of kids who are bored in their school\r\nclasses. The idea is not to move kids ahead, but to help kids learn the material schools are teaching at a\r\nmuch greater depth, and to get them comfortable taking on (and hopefully sometimes solving) really\r\nchallenging problems. I've long wanted to add a book (or two) at the high school level, but life always\r\ngot in the way. With Caroline having some time, this summer I got together a team to start on a project\r\nthat aims to bring a similar philosophy to AP Statistics, designing a curriculum that would give kids the\r\nknowledge to excel on the exam, but intentionally not taking the easiest path to just that goal. Instead,\r\nwe are trying to teach what we think is most important, to teach it at a very deep level, and to make it\r\nfun. In addition to Caroline, I have a great team: my wife Sara who's taught statistics for decades at MIT\r\n(and has a book to accompany her popular college-level online course); and Chris Avery, who's taught\r\nstatistics for many years at the Harvard Kennedy School. While the other coauthors have so much more\r\nexperience and lots of lecture notes they can adapt, it's Caroline who's really hit the ground running and\r\nhelped push the project forward. There's lots of coordination in writing a book together: you want\r\neverything in the same narrative voice, consistent mixes of abstract vs. by-example teaching, problems\r\nat the consistent levels fitting the material, consistent notation, etc. It's been remarkable to see\r\nCaroline's ability to pick up on these many nuances. She's written the first drafts of several chapters that\r\nfit in beautifully. She has taken the lead on revising and improving almost all of the sections I've drafted.\r\nAnd she has been instrumental for our ambition to modernize the curriculum and cover what people\r\noutside academia would think important. We're intentionally writing the book for the more limited\r\naudience of kids who'd like to see AP statistics done right, rather than writing the easy-path-to-getting-\r\na-five book that would sell many more copies, but I, at least, love the parts we've written and hope that\r\nit can become something deeply appreciated by those for whom it is the right match. I hope that it also\r\ncan be the start of Caroline's positive legacy.\r\nI know that Caroline made some very big mistakes at Alameda and that many people have been hurt.\r\nBut please know that she is a wonderful daughter and a wonderful person who more than anything\r\nwants a second chance to make the world a better place. Even with the obstacles she'll face, I really\r\nthink she can. I ask for your mercy and hope that you will give her the opportunity. Again, I thank you so\r\nmuch for your consideration.\r\nSincerely,\r\nде 8\r\nGlenn Ellison\r\nEllisa Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT C\r\nPage 15 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nAnna Ellison\r\nAugust 7, 2024\r\nHonorable Lewis A. Kaplan\r\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York\r\n500 Pearl Street\r\nNew York, NY 10007\r\nPage 16 of 115\r\nJudge Kaplan,\r\nMy name is Anna Ellison, and I am Caroline Ellison's younger sister. I am 26 years old and\r\nhave been working in finance for about five years. I would like to give you a bit more context on\r\nwho Caroline is as a person.\r\nSince we were little, Caroline has always been very unselfish and focused on what was best for\r\neveryone she cared about. When I think back on our childhood, she and I would often make\r\ndecisions together, on everything from what movie to watch to what game to play to what two\r\ndishes to split at a restaurant. In all of these decisions, she would pay attention only to what\r\nmade the most sense for both of us. If I cared more than she did, she would always defer to me.\r\nThe same thing extended to our family. As the oldest child she was frequently asked to babysit\r\nme and our youngest sister or do more of the chores, and she always did it without complaint\r\nabout what was fair. Someone had to do it, it made the most sense for her to do it, so she did it.\r\nThis is a quality that has continued to make her a very loyal and kind friend and sister to this day\r\nin ways both small and large. She is always happy to help me when I'm sick, to let me borrow\r\nthings or stay with her on short notice, or to do things that she doesn't like if she knows I dislike\r\nthem more.\r\nI think this quality is in large part related to our parents' influence. Both of our parents are\r\nacademic economists, and would often tell us about economic research when we were growing\r\nup. In these papers, things were always assessed based on how much good they could do for\r\npeople as a whole, adding up the effects on different people and treating them all equally instead\r\nof privileging any particular person or any sense of what was fair or equal. She definitely took\r\nthis to heart, and thought about everything she did through this lens. Similarly, our parents\r\nalways stressed the actual effects of things over the intentions, regarding a policy decision or\r\ncharitable act as good only if it actually helps people.\r\nThis worldview was a large reason why, in college, Caroline was so drawn to Effective Altruism.\r\nThe philosophy placed a large emphasis on helping all people instead of just those similar to you, Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 17 of 115\r\nwhich she admired, and on the practical results of interventions. Another reason that I think\r\ndrew her to Effective Altruism was the fact that she had met so many smart people who were\r\ninvolved with it. She has always prided herself on her ability to change her mind when she\r\nencounters a good argument for something, and within the Effective Altruism community she\r\nmet many people who were able to argue convincingly for what they believed in, using the same\r\nsorts of economic research we had heard about so often growing up.\r\nTo understand Caroline's time at Alameda, I think it is important to understand why she joined in\r\nthe first place, since it was definitely surprising to most who knew her at the time. Part of it was\r\nof course that she thought she would do well at the job and enjoy it, and part was that it would\r\nenable her to donate large amounts of money and make the financial system more efficient. A\r\nlarger part, though, was that she was extremely lonely and was looking for a place to find a new\r\nstart. At her previous job she had dated a coworker who, after over a year of dating, still was not\r\nin love with her. When they broke up, she felt like she had lost the support of her friends, who\r\nhad been his friends first, and was still forced to see him every day at work. In what seemed to\r\nher to be fortunate timing, Sam offered her the job at Alameda, and she took it in large part as a\r\nway out of this difficult situation.\r\nIn some ways, working at Alameda gave her what she had wanted. She quickly made strong\r\nfriends in her coworkers, and felt like she was contributing to something greater than herself.\r\nBut in other ways, it quickly became a very unpleasant place to work. She regularly worked 16\r\nhour days, often overnight, and a \"weekend\" for her was only working one 8-hour shift in a day.\r\nWhen FTX opened, most of the senior people except for her and Sam moved there from\r\nAlameda, leaving her desperately trying to keep things running. When we talked during this\r\ntime, she would often cry about how overwhelmed she felt. To me, the solution always seemed\r\nobvious, she should leave. But she wouldn't leave, for a few different reasons.\r\nFirst, if she had left, either someone else would have been saddled with all of the work she had,\r\nor the\r\ncompany would have completely fallen apart. She would always tell me that it was the\r\nbest thing for all of her coworkers if she stayed. From an outsider's perspective, it seemed like\r\nshe should prioritize her own happiness and leave the company behind, but she viewed the\r\ncompany and the others there as just as important, and because of the same qualities that have\r\nalways made her a caring sister, she felt she would be betraying her friends if she did leave.\r\nSecond, she was afraid of losing her friends and job all at once, the same way she had before\r\njoining Alameda. During her time at Alameda, the people there had become her close friends,\r\nand with the long hours she was working she had fallen out of touch with many of her older\r\nfriends. She was afraid, probably rightly, that if she left she would lose so many of her\r\nconnections and the people who made up her life at once. Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 18 of 115\r\nAnd finally there was Sam. Since she had first met him, while she was interning at Jane Street\r\nand he was working there full time, she seemed almost in awe of how smart he was. She always\r\ndeferred to him a good deal, both because he was in reality very smart, and also, I think, because\r\nhe was so good with words, with coming up with arguments quickly and making Caroline feel\r\nirrational if she disagreed. I remember talking to her once about how frustrating I found it to\r\nargue with one particular friend of mine. I generally consider myself good at thinking things\r\nthrough logically if given enough time, but it can take me a while to think through an argument\r\nand articulate it. This friend I was arguing with did not need that same time. If I said something\r\nwith a logical hole in it, he would point out the issue immediately, but if the situations were\r\nreversed, it might take me an hour or perhaps even a day to think things through and do the\r\nsame. When I told Caroline about this, she immediately said she felt the same way when talking\r\nwith Sam. Whenever he wanted to do something, he could easily come up with arguments in\r\nfavor. If she disagreed, she would have to spend time thinking things through to convince him\r\notherwise, but she never had the extra time, and even if she did he would have moved on by the\r\ntime she could come up with a good rebuttal. She has always prided herself on listening to\r\nrational arguments and being willing to change her mind, so she would go along with what he\r\nwanted, both professionally and personally, rather than be labeled “irrational.”\r\nSince Alameda's collapse, I have spent a good deal of time with Caroline, and I can tell you that\r\nshe has put a lot of time and effort into trying to do whatever she can do to help other people.\r\nShe put a lot of time and energy into helping the government with her testimony, and spent a lot\r\nof time talking with me about how she was trying to be the best witness she could. She has also\r\nput a lot of work into volunteering with as many different causes as she can, with food pantries\r\nand soup kitchens and tutoring and whatever other causes she could find.\r\nI truly cannot picture Caroline doing anything similar to what she did at Alameda again. She has\r\nalways only wanted to be helpful, and that has not changed, but I do think she puts less stock in\r\nslick arguments now and more in conventional wisdom. She regrets what she did very deeply,\r\nand I can't imagine her putting herself or others in a similar situation again. I know you have\r\nmany different concerns to balance, but I would like to ask that you put her in a position to prove\r\nthe sort of person she truly can be.\r\nSincerely,\r\nAna Eli\r\nAnna Ellison Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT D\r\nPage 19 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK\r\nDocument 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 20 of 115\r\nDear Judge Lewis Kaplan,\r\nI am writing this letter in support of leniency in Caroline Ellison's sentencing. My name is Kate\r\nEllison, and I am Caroline Ellison's youngest sister. I have, of course, known Caroline my entire\r\nlife, and for all twenty years of my life, we have always been close. I have always known\r\nCaroline as a kind, intelligent, and generous older sister.\r\nThere are a few stories I can tell to illustrate the presence of these qualities in Caroline, both\r\nbefore and after the events of 2022. Caroline moved to the other side of the country for college\r\nwhen I was nine years old. I was always so excited to see Caroline when she came home from\r\ncollege, and she always made time for family. She would spend time with me and Anna, our\r\nother sister, playing board games or watching movies. That time spent as sisters is one of the\r\nhighlights of my childhood. Even when Caroline was working at Alameda across the world, she\r\nalways made time for family, making sure she was there for important family events like\r\nholidays and weddings.\r\nSince I was a child, I have always looked up to Caroline as a role model academically as well.\r\nCaroline was an excellent student, and she made a good impression on all those around her. I\r\nremember that, in middle and high school, my teachers would be so happy to hear that I was\r\nCaroline's sister and remembered having her in class many years earlier. Caroline was also very\r\ngenerous with her skills. Whenever I needed help with homework, or needed some advice, I\r\nknew I could always turn to Caroline.\r\nEver since Caroline went off to college, I have been amazed at how generous and charitable she\r\nis, always maintaining her morals of helping people however she can. She has always been\r\ndedicated to giving as much as she can to others and supporting worthy causes. When she first\r\nstarted working after college, she was excited about how much she would be able to donate to\r\ncharities. Nowadays, she leads a quiet life but still makes an impact on others' however she can.\r\nHer dedication to serving others in difficult times has amazed and inspired me. She regularly\r\nvolunteers in many different capacities. She prepares and serves meals at a soup kitchen, as well\r\nas volunteering to teach English to students at a public library. During tax season, she also\r\nvolunteered as a tax preparer. She also fosters rescue dogs.\r\nCaroline is the best big sister I could imagine, and she has so much to offer to her family and her\r\ncommunity. From the beginning, she has expressed sincere remorse for her actions. If you\r\nconsider leniency in Caroline's sentencing, I am certain that Caroline will have a positive impact\r\non those around her. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.

Kaplan\r\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York\r\n500 Pearl Street\r\nNew York, NY 10007\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nI'm writing on behalf of Caroline Ellison,\r\nfuller picture of who she is.\r\n1. I wanted to share my perspective in the hope that it will give a\r\nWe got to know each other when I moved to the Bahamas to work at Alameda\r\nResearch. During the time I worked at Alameda, I found her to be a caring and supportive boss.\r\nIn spite of her nominal role as the CEO of the company, I found that she was humble, available,\r\nand accommodating, and she never used her status to get her way. When we had a\r\ndisagreement, we would talk it through as equals. It meant a lot to me that she always took the\r\ntime to answer a question or chime in with thoughts on a thread that I had started, and even as\r\nshe was endlessly busy with other pressing tasks, she would find time to chat about a tool or\r\nstrategy that I was working on.\r\nIn many ways, I found working at Alameda to be lonely - much of the company did not\r\nwork from the same office, and people were often absorbed in their own tasks. I missed the\r\ncollaborative environment I had experienced at previous workplaces. Her presence and\r\nfriendship as I got settled helped me stay sane, and I'm sure other employees of Alameda\r\nwould say the same.\r\nhave seen her be incredibly strong throughout that time - she has\r\ndeep regrets, but seeing her press forward to do what she can to make amends has been\r\ninspirational. She has been deeply involved with community service opportunities, tutoring adult\r\nstudents that are looking to earn a GED and fostering relationships with and providing books to\r\nreaders who are currently incarcerated through\r\nprison book program to name\r\na few. She clearly really cares about them, as is evident from her commuting long hours,\r\nbraving the rain and missing social events to make it to volunteer.\r\nIt has been very good to see Caroline involved in these grounded, positive impact\r\nactivities. I do not claim to understand everything that went wrong at Alameda and FTX, but it\r\nseems clear to me that the extreme level of abstraction was a catalyst for bad decisions.\r\nSpending time face-to-face with and befriending real, concrete people that don't necessarily\r\nhave exactly the same background as her has obviously been very healing. She speaks often of Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 24 of 115\r\nthe friends she's making - she recently got coffee with an older gentleman that she met at the\r\nprison book program and was telling me all about his extremely interesting life as a prison\r\nreform advocate. During tax season, she worked with an organization that offered free tax\r\npreparation for low-income taxpayers, and I distinctly remember how proud she was to make\r\nsure she had an in-depth understanding of each case and how frustrated she would get if\r\nsomeone would rush through or otherwise not treat someone's file with the respect and care\r\nthat their case deserved.\r\nI do not want to talk too deeply about our private conversations in a forum as public as\r\nthis. With her permission, though, I do want to touch on something that she said to me as FTX\r\nwas actively collapsing. It was in many ways an awful week for her, of course. In spite of that,\r\nCaroline expressed to me that amidst all her other feelings, she was immensely relieved. She\r\nhad been unhappy and felt trapped at Alameda for some time, but she didn't know how to\r\nextract herself without feeling like she was letting down her friends and employees. I think it was\r\nthis guilt and stress that led her to be so candid with Alameda employees during that week - she\r\nhad been burying it for so long she simply couldn't take hiding it anymore. I don't think she is\r\never going to forget how that felt.\r\nIt would have been so much easier for Caroline to shy away from taking responsibility for\r\nher actions or make excuses, but I have never once seen her do so. I have been endlessly\r\nimpressed by her perseverance and commitment to doing what she can to make the world a\r\nbetter place now and facing her actions head on. Multiple times, I've seen her correct friends\r\nand family who attempt to comfort her by minimizing the crimes or her role in them - even if\r\nthey're just being polite, she takes the topic very seriously.\r\nIt would be a disservice to Caroline's bravery in admitting her wrongs for me to pretend\r\nthat she does not have much to atone for. But as I believe that I am much more than my worst\r\ndecisions, I know that she is too.\r\nThank you for taking the time to read my perspective. I hope my account of her character\r\nhelps to elucidate all the ways in which society is lucky to have her in it.\r\nSincerely, Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT F\r\nPage 25 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 26 of 115\r\nMichael Dinsmore\r\nJune 1, 2024\r\nSenior U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan\r\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York\r\n500 Pearl Street\r\nNew York, NY 10007\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nCaroline Ellison and I attended the same high school from 2008 to 2012, and we were close\r\nfriends throughout that time. We were enrolled in many of the same classes and socialized\r\nfrequently after school and on weekends. We continued to see one another consistently through\r\ncollege and immediately afterward, but we fell out of frequent communication around 2018,\r\nwhen Caroline moved abroad for her work at Alameda Research. In late 2022 we reconnected\r\nand have been in contact both in-person and remotely since then.\r\nIn other words, I have known Caroline for almost 16 years, know most of her close friends, have\r\nmet her entire immediate family, and have spent considerable time in their home. Over this time,\r\nI have seen Caroline consistently demonstrate three qualities: a strong interest in ethical living,\r\ngenerosity with others, and a commitment to learning.\r\nFirst, Caroline has always shown a strong commitment to living ethically and with integrity.\r\nWhen most high school students were focused on their social lives or college admissions,\r\nCaroline spoke frequently about moral principles, how to live a good life, and obligations of\r\nservice to others. In ninth and tenth grades, we spent many hours together during our church's\r\nconfirmation program, which required us to complete volunteer hours at a local soup kitchen.\r\nOnce the program was over, Caroline and I wanted to continue to volunteer, and we made\r\nindependent arrangements to do so.\r\nAt the same time, Caroline was searching for the best way to implement these commitments. She\r\noften expressed the desire for a comprehensive moral and metaphysical worldview like the\r\nchurch offered, but she was looking for something more intellectually coherent, in her view, than\r\nCatholicism seemed to be. By the end of high school, Caroline became interested in effective\r\naltruism and attended some meetings or conferences. While I was critical of effective altruism, I\r\nwas not at all surprised that Caroline was attracted to it: it seemed like the logical outcome of her\r\npassion for ethical commitment, one that offered community and purpose in a secular manner.\r\nSimply put, over the past sixteen years, Caroline has demonstrated as much interest in and\r\npassion for ethical behavior as anyone I know. Since 2022, she has done so in new contexts. She\r\nand I have spoken several times about her desire to serve others and her various means of doing\r\nso at a time when she faces unusual constraints. We brainstormed ideas, and, after trying several,\r\nshe described powerful experiences to me: helping low-income families in the Bronx with tax\r\npreparation, teaching English as a second language and civics to immigrants, assisting at a food\r\npantry, and preparing meals for people with chronic illnesses. I was struck by how persistently\r\n1 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 27 of 115\r\nCaroline sought these opportunities out. Because of her present notoriety, she faced several\r\nobstacles, including many organizations that would not accept her as a volunteer, but she was\r\nable to find alternatives and use the past year and a half in ways that help others. I'm sure she\r\nwill continue to do so in the future.\r\nSecond, Caroline has always been extremely generous and loyal towards others. In high school\r\nand afterward, she always enjoyed hosting friends at her house, and for many of us her house\r\nwas a second home. She expressed her friendship in many small ways, for example showing\r\nextreme interest in and deference to my life-threatening food allergies when entertaining. We\r\nfrequently spoke about how best to show respect to others through courtesy and hospitality. But\r\nabove all I was especially struck by how much love and support she showed to a close friend\r\naround the time of that friend's father's death. In that time, she modelled committed, supportive\r\nfriendship in a way that I have tried to imitate ever since. More broadly, Caroline has always\r\nbeen good to friends, peers, colleagues, and neighbors; I never heard a serious criticism of her\r\nuntil late 2022.\r\nI experienced this in an especially personal way in 2021, when my only brother killed himself.\r\nAlthough Caroline and I were not in regular communication at that time, she went out of her way\r\nto extend herself and make herself available to me in an extraordinary manner. Those who have\r\nexperienced loss often report that even close friends and family pull away in the aftermath: not\r\nCaroline. Her response was far beyond what I could have expected.\r\nFor this reason, it surprised me when, around the time she joined Alameda, Caroline seemed to\r\npull away from many of the people close to her. Once she moved abroad, she seemed to vanish; I\r\ncertainly lost contact with her, and I gathered from a number of her friends that she was\r\nincreasingly isolated in a bubble of people surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried, their work, and\r\neffective altruism. This was especially strange to me because it seemed so out of sync with\r\nCaroline's earlier priorities, namely ideas and people. I had always assumed Caroline would be a\r\nprofessor or perhaps do mission-driven nonprofit work, and instead she was involved in high-risk\r\ntrading, even though she had never expressed any desire for financial gain to me. I had always\r\nassumed Caroline would be surrounded by family, friends, and community, but instead she was\r\nliving in seclusion from her natural environment. The further she went into this bubble, the less\r\nshe resembled the Caroline I had known before—and the Caroline she is today.\r\nFinally, Caroline has always been an extremely thoughtful and curious person. I remember\r\nhaving long conversations in high school about topics like the causes of World War I or the ideal\r\nform of government. During our senior year of high school, Caroline and I attended a biweekly\r\nclass after school that granted no credit, but simply gave us the opportunity to learn about\r\nmodern European history. Caroline is someone who reflects on experiences and learns from\r\nthem, and from our conversations I believe she has learned a lot from the events of recent years.\r\nAnyone who knows Caroline could see that she is manifestly pained by remorse for her actions,\r\nthat she wishes to make amends, and that she will never repeat her mistakes. In our private\r\nconversations, she has shown a great deal of reflection about the recent past. She has described\r\nseveral different moments when she made bad choices that enabled her later mistakes: moving\r\n2 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 28 of 115\r\nabroad, working for a romantic interest, isolating herself, and putting Sam Bankman-Fried before\r\nfriends, family, and her own values.\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Caroline has reassessed the entire period of her life consumed by\r\nAlameda Research. At one point she said something like: “when I look back at the past few\r\nyears, I cannot believe the person I was. I can hardly recognize that person.” She went on to\r\nexplain multiple ways in which she is trying to act differently now-to act like the person she\r\nwas before Alameda.\r\nCaroline is one of the most cerebral and undemonstrative people I know, but, when she speaks\r\nabout her regrets related to FTX, she speaks emotionally and with conviction. For almost sixteen\r\nyears, I had never seen Caroline lose her cool, but when she first told me about her remorse, she\r\nwas shaking and crying. I cannot recall ever seeing her cry before.\r\nCaroline is seeking to live ethically, shows extreme generosity towards others, and reflects on her\r\nexperiences. These three characteristics, which Caroline has shown from the day I met her until\r\ntoday, lead me to believe that she will use her time in the future to contribute positively to\r\nsociety, both in the intimate sphere of friends and family and in the broader sphere of\r\nvolunteering and charitable work.\r\nSincerely,\r\nMichael Dinsmore\r\nMichael Dinsmore\r\n3 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT G\r\nPage 29 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 30 of 115\r\nHon. Lewis A. Kaplan\r\nUnited States District Judge\r\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan\r\nUnited States Courthouse\r\n500 Pearl St.\r\nNew York, NY 10007-1312\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nMy name is Leila Clark, and I am a professional software engineer. From 2020 to 2022, I was\r\nfriends with Caroline Ellison. I write to present a portrait of the Caroline I knew and hope this\r\nwill help you determine a fair sentence for her.\r\nI first met Caroline in 2016, when we interned together at Jane Street Capital, though we did not\r\nkeep in touch. In 2020, I moved back home to Hong Kong, where Caroline and I struck up a\r\ncasual friendship. In September 2021, I started working for FTX. We both moved to the\r\nBahamas, where we became closer friends. By 2022, I'd say we saw each other two or three\r\ntimes a week.\r\nIn November 2022, I learned that Alameda had borrowed and spent FTX customer deposits.\r\nI resigned immediately, and I have not spoken with Caroline since.\r\nCaroline made choices that hurt many people, among them me and many of my close friends.\r\nHowever, I also know the public has a narrow view of who she is. I'd like to highlight some\r\nparts of her personality that have been overlooked.\r\nCaroline is deeply motivated by utilitarian ethics. I recall discussing with her The Life You Can\r\nSave and its famously utilitarian author, Peter Singer. Later, I learned that Caroline subscribed to\r\na more esoteric philosophy - that the happiness of people yet to be born is as important as ours\r\ntoday. Caroline also expressed concern that artificial intelligence would take over the world and\r\ncause humanity's extinction. This worldview led Caroline to believe that her highest and best\r\npurpose should be to make as much money as she could while spending those funds on\r\npreventing this AI disaster.\r\nIt's hard to believe that some people think this way. I don't share Caroline's concern. But many\r\npeople in Silicon Valley do, including some of its most powerful leaders. Nobody, including\r\nCaroline, would say that this justifies fraud. I don't bring this up to excuse her actions. I only\r\nwant to emphasize that, for most of the time I knew her, she believed that her life must be\r\ndevoted to the service of humanity now and in the future.\r\nPerhaps because of Caroline's beliefs about AI, she dedicated her life to work in a way I found\r\nbewildering. When I met Caroline again in Hong Kong, I saw her infrequently. She was in the\r\noffice all the time - fourteen hours a day, seven days a week. Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 31 of 115\r\nAs I learned at Jane Street, cryptocurrency trading happens 24/7 and is punctuated by unexpected\r\nevents. Someone has to monitor the trading systems at all hours. To manage this risk, Alameda\r\nran three eight-hour shifts throughout the day. Many times, I saw Caroline host friends for\r\ndinner, then pack a bag and return to the office for the 2am night shift. She worked a lot of those.\r\nShe once told me that even though she assigned shifts, she often gave overnights to herself\r\nbecause nobody else wanted to do them. It became a running joke among those of us with day\r\njobs that we never knew when or if we would see her.\r\nLater, Caroline told me that those night shifts were hard on her. She spent many of them sitting\r\nalone, in front of a monitor and a sunlamp, desperately trying to stay awake. She said that as she\r\nblearily stared at the computers she would wonder why she was doing it; if it was really worth\r\nspending her youth and happiness on this.\r\nThings were better in the Bahamas, where Caroline worked only eleven hours a day and took\r\nSundays off. Though I only knew a limited amount about her professional work, I could see that\r\nCaroline was a gracious and humble manager. Recognizing the limits of her experience, she\r\nhired and promoted traders with leadership experience at respected American market-making\r\nfirms to run Alameda's proprietary trading business. She also genuinely cared about the\r\nhappiness of her staff. In the summer of 2022, she told me that she spent weeks writing\r\nperformance reviews, thinking carefully about what her reports did well and how they could\r\nimprove. From my experience, this level of care is rare among technical managers. I've seen too\r\nmany managers who treat their reports like wooden chess pieces. I respected how Caroline\r\nalways saw hers as persons and not merely as means.\r\nAt the peak of Alameda's success, Caroline lived a comfortable life but not a flashy one. One\r\nreason we remained friends despite her seemingly immense wealth was because she never\r\nbragged about it. She didn't fly private jets, or sponsor celebrity galas, or buy a yacht. Once she\r\nasked me for my thoughts on how she should redecorate her room in the Bahamas. I remarked\r\nthat the wealthy people we knew in New York hired interior designers and paid tens of thousands\r\nof dollars for the service. In the end, she decided that a $150 online design service was good\r\nenough for her.\r\n-\r\nIt always seemed to me that Caroline found the finer things in life less interesting than thoughtful\r\nideas and good conversation. She is funny and witty, in speech and in writing. She has a spirited,\r\ncreative mind. In Hong Kong, she wrote a trilogy of role-playing games inspired by the city's\r\nhistory. She used to gather her friends together to play them – that's how I met her. She once\r\nmade a New Year's resolution not to wear pants for a year. I think she pulled it off, though she\r\nonce made a carve-out for shorts. She has a fondness for Regency romances, and is a fan of Jane\r\nAusten and the TV drama Bridgerton. I hear she's finally had the time to write her own Regency\r\nnovel. I hope to read it someday.\r\nI've spent many nights trying to reconcile the person I know with what I've learned about\r\nCaroline during the criminal proceedings. Looking back, I conclude that she valued her own\r\nfeelings and desires too little. Why else would she work all those night shifts? Once, her great-\r\nuncle took us on a tour of Napa Valley in his vintage four-seater Cessna. Before I could say Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 32 of 115\r\nanything, she eagerly jumped into the back and offered me the front seat. She knew that I loved\r\nsmall airplanes. She said it was the utilitarian thing to do, since I would enjoy the better more.\r\nThis was no small part of what made her a kind friend, but I think it also made her easily\r\ninfluenced by those around her. In September 2021, when she and Sam broke up, she told me she\r\nwas miserable. Of course! She worked for a firm owned by her ex-boyfriend, in an industry that\r\nvalorized him. “So why not move back to Berkeley?\" I asked her. She was rich, talented and\r\nsmart. I thought she could do great things. To this day, I don't know why she didn't, but I wish\r\nshe had. I think she would have made better choices. It is evident to me now that she was under\r\ntremendous pressure as Alameda's CEO, feeling obliged to somehow fund Sam's spending and\r\nempire-building.\r\nIn October 2022, I learned that Caroline was dating a close friend of mine, someone I had known\r\nfor five years. I was very happy for her. I said that he was a vast improvement over her ex. I was\r\nbeing sardonic and genuine. Her new partner is honest and has integrity; he finds even the small\r\nwhite lies of corporate politics distasteful. I have known him to be kind, intelligent and\r\nempathetic. He has quietly supported her this last year. I believe that this new and kind\r\nenvironment will be good for her.\r\nCaroline has apologized for what she did. She did so in open court to FTX and Alameda's\r\ncustomers, employees and investors. An apology does not make up for harms done. But, for my\r\nsmall part, I appreciate it. From what I know of her, I believe her actions and feelings are\r\ngenuine, and I ask you to consider that too.\r\nThank you for reading this letter and taking my thoughts into consideration as you deliberate on\r\nthe appropriate sentence. I am happy to answer any further questions you may have.\r\nRespectfully,\r\nNier A\r\nkin\r\nLeila Clark Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT H\r\nPage 33 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nJanuary 15, 2024\r\nDear Judge Kaplan:\r\nI have known Caroline Ellison since Autumn 2012.\r\nPage 34 of 115\r\nIn the four years that\r\nCaroline, we talked regularly and spent much of our\r\ntime together. I cannot recall any instance during that time when Caroline ever intentionally\r\ncaused harm to another person. On the contrary, I found her to be kind, generous, and considerate\r\nof the feelings of others. On first impression she could come across as quiet and bookish, but\r\nupon getting to know her better she was warm and had quite a depth of feeling.\r\nFrom early on, it seemed to me that Caroline felt a deep responsibility to do something with her\r\nlife to help the world. I got the impression that she spent a lot of time pondering this. I remember\r\nhaving discussions with her as underclassmen and being surprised and impressed that someone\r\nso young was already thinking about their impact on such a large scale. The principles of\r\nrationality were always important to her, from big decisions to small ones, and the Effective\r\nAltruism (EA) movement resonated deeply with her. She was involved with the Stanford EA\r\ngroup for multiple years. I believe this was her main extracurricular activity in college, and many\r\nof her friends were made through EA. Senior year she mentioned to me that she had taken a\r\npledge with other members of the EA group to give a certain percentage of her earnings to\r\ncharity for the rest of her life. She explained to me the concept of \"earning to give,\" that is,\r\npursuing a career with high earning potential with the intent to donate most of one's income to\r\nhigh-impact charities. I believe this became her life plan and that it influenced her decisions to\r\nwork at both Jane Street and Alameda.\r\nWhile intelligent about many things, Caroline could be naïve about others. I remember once,\r\nsometime after college, she told me that she had lost her phone. When I asked her how she lost it,\r\nshe explained that she had been waiting outside a train station, and a young man she did not\r\nknow had approached her and asked to borrow her smartphone to make a call. She gave it to him,\r\nand to her dismay, he ran off with it. I remember being struck by how trusting (and perhaps\r\nfoolish) it had been for her to hand over an expensive electronic device to a stranger without\r\nconsidering the risk of theft.\r\nOn a more personal note, even before Caroline began working at Alameda, there were a couple\r\nof situations where she became involved in relationships that were not particularly good for her. I\r\nremember feeling frustrated on more than one occasion that an otherwise intelligent young\r\nwoman had what seemed to me to be sub-optimal judgement when it came to romantic\r\nrelationships. One case of note occurred when Caroline was living in New York after graduation.\r\nShe became involved with a young man and was very serious about the relationship. However,\r\nshe told me a few months in that he said that he did not love her, and that he felt it was unlikely Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 35 of 115\r\nthat he ever would. Caroline was deeply hurt by this, yet she continued to date him for the better\r\npart of a year after that. She expressed to me that the relationship made her unhappy, but she\r\ncould not seem to work up the momentum to leave it. It wasn't until the opportunity at Alameda\r\ncame up that she felt able to break things off with him, and it wasn't long after that she moved to\r\nCalifornia. In some ways, it seemed like taking the job at Alameda was an escape from the\r\nsituation. Her romantic involvement with Mr. Bankman-Fried began within the year.\r\nI did not know all the particulars of Caroline's relationship with Mr. Bankman-Fried, and she\r\ncertainly never disclosed any information to me regarding criminal activity. When she first told\r\nme about their romantic involvement in 2018, I was surprised. I did not think it was a good idea\r\ngiven that he was essentially her manager, and it would create a conflict of interest. I recall\r\nquestioning the advisability of the relationship and perceiving Caroline's response as defensive.\r\nDespite her emphasis on evidence and logic in many parts of her life, I don't think reason played\r\nmuch of a role at all when it came to how she felt about Sam. The relationship certainly seemed\r\nto be problematic. In 2020 she wrote to me, \"I feel like our relationship has been feeling\r\nasymmetric lately, like he's more like my therapist or something than my boyfriend, which I don't\r\nlike.\" And in July 2021, after receiving some kind of work feedback, she mentioned, \"having this\r\nboss-employee dynamic where Sam tells me I'm doing something wrong just makes our\r\nrelationship weird.\" It was clear that she desired his affirmation, attention, and approval, and that\r\nshe often felt that these needs were not met. She talked about breaking up with him a lot. In the\r\nsame conversation in July 2021, she wrote to me, \"There's definitely a part of me that feels\r\nrelieved by the idea of us breaking up which is maybe a sign that we just should.\" She added, \"It\r\njust feels like there are so many worries and questions and confusions right now, and breaking up\r\nwould just get rid of all of them and things would be simple and easy. But also obviously there's\r\na part of me that feels really sad about it, and like, is avoiding even thinking about not being with\r\nhim anymore because the idea feels too horrible. Also tbh it would kind of [expletive] up my\r\nwhole life, like I work with him, I sit 5 feet away from him, my main friend group is his\r\nroommates and their other friends.\" The times that Caroline did break things off with Sam didn't\r\nusually stick. She would resolve to be done with him, but a few words from him would change\r\nher mind. She was like someone who says they want to give up smoking but can't seem to stop\r\nsneaking cigarettes. The last time she told me they had gotten back together in December 2021,\r\nshe commented, \"Maybe it's a dumb idea.\" I didn't hear much about their relationship after that.\r\nI was truly shocked when I read Caroline's plea regarding her part in the events at Alameda and\r\nFTX. It has been difficult for me to reconcile her criminal actions with the person that I have\r\nknown her to be. I can only hope that this letter is helpful in providing additional context for the\r\ndecision you have before you. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.\r\nSincerely, Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT I\r\nPage 36 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 37 of 115\r\nDecember 29, 2023\r\nTo the Honorable Lewis Kaplan:\r\nI am Caroline Ellison's aunt, the older sister of her mother, and am writing on Caroline's behalf\r\nbefore her sentencing hearing. I have worked my entire career in higher education, where I have\r\ntaught and mentored hundreds of young people and am currently an associate professor at\r\nBoston University's School of Medicine. I speak from the perspective of an educator who has\r\nhad continuous involvement with motivated and accomplished young adults for more than 30\r\nyears.\r\nAlmost five years ago, I was at a professional meeting having dinner with a group of long-time\r\nfriends. One member of the group asked us each to describe a situation or event in our lives we\r\nwere grateful for. When my turn came, I spoke about how inspired by and grateful I was for the\r\ngeneration of young women in my family, my own daughter and my four nieces. I tremendously\r\nadmired their courage and commitment to their ideals. I was excited to see their growing\r\nindependence, their confidence and competence in a wide range of areas and could hardly wait\r\nto see what they would accomplish in their lives. Caroline was the only one at the time who had\r\nfinished college and started on her career and was a role model for all of them throughout their\r\nchildhoods. I will leave it to my daughter and nieces to describe their interactions with Caroline\r\nand focus on my own relationship with her.\r\nI have always felt especially close to Caroline and recognized myself in her in many ways. One of\r\nthe most striking things about Caroline as a child was her voracious appetite for reading. I, too,\r\nlearned to read before I can remember, and found and read every book in my parents' house. As\r\na child, Caroline read many books she could comprehend intellectually before she understood\r\nthem emotionally. I also know, as was true for me, that she sometimes felt a sense of isolation\r\nfrom children her age and could use her reading to retreat to worlds that seemed more\r\ncaptivating or rewarding than reality. Unlike some of her peers, Caroline's academic\r\naccomplishments were not the result of parental pressure. If anything, her parents worked\r\nagainst Caroline's natural tendency to bury her head in a book and pushed her to engage in non-\r\nacademic activities. Caroline seldom mentioned her grades or other accomplishments, much\r\nless bragged about them. What I remember instead is her kindness and loyalty to friends and\r\nfamily. One of her close friends in middle school lost her father to suicide; for years until high\r\nschool graduation, that friend spent every Tuesday evening with Caroline and her family, having\r\ndinner, doing her homework, and often spending the night.\r\nI was the first family member to visit Caroline after she started college at Stanford. On that trip I\r\nnoticed she was not eating meat, and she admitted she had decided to become a vegetarian.\r\nWhen I asked why she had eaten turkey at our family Christmas a few weeks before, she said\r\nshe didn't want to hurt her mom's feelings or disrupt the meal for anyone else. This seemed\r\ntypical of Caroline, simultaneously committed to her principles but not wanting to\r\ninconvenience anyone else. When she got her first job at Jayne Street after graduation, I will Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 38 of 115\r\nadmit I was surprised; I imagined she would pursue a career in academia. I realize now that she\r\nwas being influenced by the ideas of effective altruism. My exasperated sister told me that\r\nCaroline planned to donate most of her salary to charity and commented that perhaps she\r\nshould save money for a down payment on a house first. To me, this seemed less surprising, and\r\nwas in line with what I understood about Caroline's evolving ideals and commitment to society.\r\nCaroline soon left to join Alameda Research, and not long after that the company moved to\r\nHong Kong. During the pandemic, we saw very little of her; travel was almost impossible, so\r\nconnection was through periodic video calls. I knew almost no details about her job, although it\r\nwas clear that her social life was centered entirely around her work colleagues, a situation\r\nintensified by social isolation measures. I have wondered if that total focus on the company, and\r\nisolation from family, friends, and her previous life contributed to her eventual problems at\r\nAlameda and FTX. Since the collapse of both companies, her move back to the U.S., and her\r\nguilty pleas, Caroline takes as a matter of course the change in her circumstances and the\r\nrestrictions she lives under. I have never heard her complain. When I visited her in New York\r\nearly in 2023, she was trying to fill her time with volunteer work. She was very excited about a\r\nposition she had obtained helping low-income families prepare tax returns. Just a couple weeks\r\nlater, she was asked to leave when they realized who she was. She also told me about a\r\nvolunteer position she had applied for, running a book club for inmates on Ryker's Island, and\r\nhad already started preparing materials for it. Again, she was turned down based on her history\r\nwith Alameda. She applied for a job working with a charity that promotes math education for\r\ngirls and young women. Yet again, she was turned down based on her record. I understand the\r\nneed for all these organizations to carefully screen their employees and volunteers, nor have I\r\nheard Caroline complain about their decisions, but I can see how her inability to contribute to\r\ncauses she values has hurt and frustrated her.\r\nThat dinner with my colleagues, when I spoke about the young women in our family with such\r\nlove and pride, took place only two months before Caroline left to join Alameda Research.\r\nCircumstances have changed in many ways since then, not just for her; the stresses and\r\nisolation of the pandemic were especially damaging to students and young adults, who will\r\nlikely never see their own lives and opportunities in the same way. What remains unchanged is\r\nmy admiration and excitement for all these young women, including Caroline. She has made\r\nserious mistakes and acknowledged them, and her life is on hold waiting for the consequences.\r\nShe is managing the wait with amazing good humor and grace. I cannot predict what\r\nopportunities will be hers in the future, but I know she will make the best of them and continue\r\nin her commitment to improve the world around her.\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nShann für\r\nShannon Fisher, M.D., Ph.D. Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT J\r\nPage 39 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 40 of 115\r\nFebruary 28, 2024\r\nJudge Lewis Kaplan\r\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York\r\nYour Honor:\r\nRe: United States v. Caroline Ellison, S2 22 Cr. 673 (RA)\r\nI am writing regarding the sentencing of my niece, Caroline Ellison, and\r\nunderstand this letter may be presented to you in connection with her sentencing. I do not\r\nintend to comment on the charges against her to which she pled guilty, and candidly have no\r\npersonal knowledge of the facts involved. Rather, I am writing simply to bring to the Court's\r\nattention some issues regarding Caroline that may be of relevance in understanding the\r\nreasons for her involvement in this very disappointing matter.\r\nI have known Caroline since she was born, and have watched her grow up, but\r\nbecause I live a long way away from her family only saw her on average once every year or\r\ntwo. That said, it has been clear throughout her life that she is very bright and very talented\r\nacademically. She grew up in a family with two academics as parents and was constantly\r\nsurrounded by other professors and children of other professors. Her childhood was filled\r\nwith academic studies and constant academic games and competitions.\r\nWhile her upbringing has certainly given her tremendous advantages in\r\nsucceeding in academics and in the academic world, and she developed a high degree of\r\nconfidence that she could succeed at anything, it also came with the downside that to a large\r\nextent she lived in an academic bubble that led to a fairly high degree of naivete about things\r\noutside of the academic world. She also never worked in a fast-food restaurant, had a\r\ncomparable job or had other experiences that would expose her to working to a significant\r\ndegree with people outside the academic world.\r\nGrowing up, Caroline also never seemed to be that interested in being wealthy,\r\nbuying expensive clothes, jewelry, or cars. She actually always seemed to be very\r\nconservative about money and never appeared to feel a need to impress anyone in anything\r\noutside of academics. It is not that she was not interested in money, rather that it just did not\r\nseem to be a heavily motivating factor for her. Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 41 of 115\r\nCandidly, I was fairly surprised when I heard that she was planning on going into\r\nfinance following college, as I always assumed she would eventually be a professor or go\r\ninto government and work on something like cryptology. Throughout her life she always\r\nseemed to take the most joy in solving puzzles and equations and winning at math, trivia, and\r\nword games. My sense of how she ended up in finance is that, in part, people in that industry\r\nrecognized that her knowledge of and aptitude with math, computers, and algorithms as well\r\nas her work ethic, could help them make substantial amounts of money. I think the amount\r\nof money they offered to pay her certainly made her feel more comfortable about going into\r\nthat area, but I also think a major motivation was the opportunity to work on what she\r\nconsidered interesting and challenging problems, much like in her many years on math\r\nteams.\r\nAs Caroline moved from Jane Street to Alameda, my sense was that the potential\r\nto make significant money was of interest to her, but almost more as a way of score-keeping\r\nsuccesses, and the challenge of working on complex problems and developing programs and\r\nalgorithms to solve the problems was her major motivation. My sense is also that people at\r\nAlameda felt that her skill set, and perhaps other aspects of her personality, could be very\r\nuseful to them.\r\nI am not suggesting that Caroline should bear no blame for what occurred, rather\r\ntrying to provide some insight as to why she may have ended up in this situation and where\r\nshe may go from here. In the many years she has interacted with me and my family, she has\r\nalways been a very kind, caring, and considerate person. Caroline still seems to be the same\r\ncaring person she was years ago, and still has the same fascination with math, algorithms and\r\nsolving intellectual challenges, and if anything seems to have more of a focus on helping\r\nother people but now is less naive.\r\nI firmly believe Caroline can do a lot of good in the world. She still has the\r\nintellect and work ethic to be a very useful contributor in many areas in and outside\r\nacademics. I hope she will have the chance to do some good in the world and expect to be\r\nless surprised by what she does next.\r\nVery truly yours,\r\nMichael Ellison Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT K\r\nPage 42 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1\r\nChristopher Snyder\r\nHyatt Professor of Economics\r\nDARTMOUTH\r\nFiled 09/10/24\r\nPage 43 of 115\r\n301 Rockefeller Hall\r\nDepartment of Economics\r\nDartmouth College\r\nHanover, NH 03755\r\nVOX\r\nAMANTIS\r\n1769\r\nIN\r\nDESERTO\r\nHonorable Lewis A.

My wife and I have three daughters\r\naround the same ages as the three Ellison girls and they all became good friends. We\r\nwould make sure to see each other regularly, and we got to know and love Caroline and\r\nall the Ellison children.\r\nCaroline was a lovely and brilliant child. I clearly recall (because the anecdote\r\nwas so remarkable) a visit when she was three and my one-year old daughter was sitting\r\non her lap and her reading her a book with the word “flamingo” among others without\r\npause. When she was an older elementary-school student, I also when a large group of\r\nfriends would spend a weekend together every other year, she, the oldest, would script\r\nand direct a play with the other ten or twelve children, which they would perform for the\r\nparents. She was kind and patient with the younger children despite their sometimes\r\nwandering attention---a natural teacher.\r\nI remember Caroline as a spiritual person. She was reading Shakespeare at a\r\nyoung age, and it really meant something to her. In middle and high school, she was a\r\ndevout alter server. Her parents mentioned that she moved from Catholicism to Effective\r\nAltruism. My firm belief is that this was a continuation of her spiritual journal, a serious\r\nsearch for how to live a good and holy life.\r\nI have little doubt that Caroline was fully committed to the “earn to give\"\r\nphilosophy not to generate wealth for herself but to give as much as possible to effective\r\ncharities. Before becoming CEO at Alameda Research, she worked at Jane Street, earning\r\na fraction of what she would go on to earn as CEO but still a substantial hedge-fund\r\nsalary. I recall her parents somewhat distressed that she was giving away most of her Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 44 of 115\r\nsalary each year to charitable causes. They deeply admired her generosity of course but\r\nas parents looking out for their daughter would have preferred she save a greater portion\r\nto buy a house for herself and provide for her eventual family, especially because it was\r\nlikely her employment would locate her in New York or some other expensive city. She\r\nwas not giving from her excess but making a sacrifice. The fact she did this when no one\r\nwas looking gives me confidence this was truly her plan when she went into the much\r\nhigher profile position. She also lived a rather abstemious life, spending considerably less\r\nas a fraction of her salary than typical on food, car, housing. This was not a ruse to gain\r\nan PR advantage because, again, she had no inkling of being famous at Jane Street.\r\nI am terribly sorry that events turned out as they did. I am proud that when she\r\nfinally broke away from the chaotic situation and malign influences, she make a full\r\naccount of events and gave the court and the public valuable information in pursuit of\r\njustice, even at the substantial personal cost of embarrassment and possibly liberty.\r\nMy family and I love Caroline and look forward to welcoming her back to a\r\nnormal life with more stability and better influences as guides.\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nChristopher Snyder\r\nChristopher Snyder Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT L\r\nPage 45 of 115 דווין\r\nCase 1:22-cr-00673-LAK\r\nDocument 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\r\nEsther Duflo\r\nAbdul Latif Jameel Professor of\r\nPage 46 of 115\r\n77 Massachusetts Avenue\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts\r\n02139-4307\r\nPhone 617-258-7013\r\nPoverty Alleviation and\r\nDevelopment Economics\r\nDirector, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action\r\nLab\r\nFax\r\n617-253-6915\r\nEmail\r\neduflo@mit.edu\r\nhttp://econ-www.mit.edu/faculty/eduflo\r\nDepartment of Economics\r\nBuilding E52-544\r\nJanuary 8, 2024\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nThis letter is to provide you with some background information for the sentencing of\r\nCaroline Ellison. It contains no information or opinion about the case, but is meant to share\r\nwhat I know about her as a person.\r\nI have known Caroline since she was a small child. Her two parents are my colleagues, and\r\nwelcomed me into the Cambridge community, when I joined MIT, first as a PhD student and\r\nthen as faculty member. This is an incredibly warm family with wonderful parents and three\r\ngreat girls, with Caroline being the eldest.\r\nI visited frequently with them, and I have seen her grow. Caroline was evidently an\r\nunusually gifted child, who taught herself to read around three or four, took interest in adult\r\nconversations without being overbearing, and started to excel in mathematics competitions\r\nfrom a young age. She was friendly, caring to her little sisters, and empathetic.\r\nThere are plenty of gifted children, but Caroline stood out for her independence and\r\ndetermination. She wanted to do everything by herself, even things that perhaps she could\r\nhave been helped with. She also stood out by how incredibly serious she was at all times.\r\nAnd finally, quite early, in her concerns for helping others, and her questions about her\r\nresponsibilities in the world. We discussed my work, which is about world poverty. By the\r\ntime she left for college she had grown into a good person.\r\nAfter college, when it was time to embark into a profession, she had some tough choices to\r\nmake. She was evidently an extremely talented mathematician, but did not want to become\r\nan academic mathematician, because she was not sure what impact it could have. Being an\r\neconomist was out of the question, with two parents in the profession.\r\nThe effective altruism movement exercised a strong pull on her, as it does on many talented\r\nstudents: faced with the question on what her role was in the world, she found the answer\r\nthat she could make money and donate it very logical and attractive. This is no doubt in my\r\nmind that this was truly the reason why she joined Jane Street, and then Alameda. She was\r\nnot at all interested in being in the spotlight or living lavishly, but she found the enterprise of\r\nusing her math not just to make money but to help others who, she believed, would then\r\ndonate it as well. She lived by these principles, donating most of whatever she earned. Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 47 of 115\r\nMy last conversation with Caroline was in September of 2022, at her parents' house. I have\r\nalways been skeptical of the particular logic of effective altruism, and of course in the fall of\r\n2022, with the crypto world already in some amounts of troubles, I wanted to know whether\r\nshe was worried she could inadvertently do more harm than good. I obviously had no\r\nknowledge about any of the specifics, but was generally concerned about the direction of the\r\nentire industry.\r\nCaroline still did believe in her project, very earnestly. She believed that the crypto industry\r\nhad ultimately a useful role to play and could outgrow its problems. Most importantly, she\r\nwas still passionate about the philanthropic projects that were rationalizing both her actions\r\nand the actions of others. We agreed to disagree and left it at that. I came away thinking she\r\nwas still the young idealistic Caroline, and perhaps a little naïve.\r\nSince she pleaded guilty, other than preparing for the case, Caroline has kept busy writing a\r\ntextbook in statistics and volunteering in various organizations. I am sure if given a chance\r\nshe will do everything she can to redeem herself and find a way to use her talents to be\r\nhelpful to society.\r\nI hope this provides some useful insight in who Caroline is at a person, and will help you in\r\ncoming to an appropriate sentencing.\r\nSincerely,\r\nEsten du\r\nEsther Duflo Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT M\r\nPage 48 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 49 of 115\r\nAdam Yedidia\r\nJanuary 12, 2024\r\nLewis A. Kaplan\r\nJudge\r\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan\r\nUnited States Courthouse\r\n500 Pearl St.\r\nNew York, NY 10007-1312\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nMy name is Adam Yedidia; I was a software engineer at FTX. You may remember me as one of the first\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution in the criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried.\r\nI became friends with Caroline Ellison when I started working for FTX in January 2021, although I first met\r\nher sometime before then while visiting Alameda's old office in Berkeley, California. After I joined FTX,\r\nCaroline and I often spent time with friends at an apartment in the Central district of Hong Kong. At the\r\ntime, FTX and Alameda shared an office, so I often saw her at work as well. She had a reputation for\r\nworking hard, and was often at the office very late or very early. After FTX's headquarters moved to the\r\nBahamas, I shared a luxury apartment with her and eight others in the Albany resort on the west side of\r\nNassau.\r\nCaroline is a kind, warm, and friendly person. In Hong Kong and in the Bahamas, we sometimes played\r\nboard games or word games together, especially detective games or story-based games. There were a\r\nfew occasions on which she organized large games or social events for 10 or 20 other people in her\r\nspare time. Caroline has a knack for word or social games, and is able to solve word problems and\r\ngames with astonishing speed. On many occasions in the Bahamas, Caroline also made baked goods\r\nand other food for everyone else. Caroline has also written fiction, some of which she kindly allowed me\r\nto read. On top of her other gifts, Caroline is an extremely talented writer.\r\nWhen FTX froze withdrawals and customers found that their money had been stolen, Caroline told the\r\nemployees of Alameda, and by extension, the world, the truth about what had happened at an all-hands\r\nmeeting. Because of that, employees at FTX and Alameda, and soon afterwards, the public, learned\r\nabout the crimes that had been committed earlier than they otherwise would have.\r\nI like to imagine that in a happier world than this one, Caroline wrote a book and became an acclaimed\r\nauthor--or took some other job that otherwise makes use of her gift with words and the intelligence and\r\nempathy that spills out of her. I think that Caroline would also be an amazing teacher. I hope that in the\r\nfuture, she has the opportunity to do so.\r\nI like Caroline. I enjoy her company. I am proud to call her my friend. I hope that you will choose to give\r\nher a lenient sentence.\r\nThank you,\r\nAdam Yedidia\r\nAdam Yedidia Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT N\r\nPage 50 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 51 of 115\r\nRavi Vakil\r\nDecember 26, 2023.\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nAlthough I am a professor of mathematics at Stanford University, I write this letter as a\r\nprivate citizen. I am writing in case any information I have may help in your decision regarding\r\nthe sentencing of Caroline Ellison. My comments will only relate to the interaction I have had\r\nwith her.\r\nI know Ms. Ellison in several capacities. I met her when she arrived at Stanford, when I\r\ntaught a course in the \"Education as Self-Fashioning\" family of classes. I then taught Ellison in\r\nMath 120, our first quarter \"honors\" algebra class. Finally, I was her advisor in her\r\nundergraduate major, in mathematics.\r\n---\r\nThe Education as Self-Fashioning course was an intense experience for us all, and was\r\nthe first quarter the course was ever offered. The \"ESF\" family of classes was a liberal arts\r\nexperiment that has since evolved into a much less intense (indeed, staid) requirement in the\r\nStanford first-year program. My incarnation was a liberal arts course, but from the point of\r\nview of the formal sciences (in the sense of the mathematical sciences, computer science, the\r\n\"formal\" part of statistics, etc.). There were problem sets, which included mathematically\r\ndifficult problems (that weaker students could avoid, but Ms. Ellison always engaged with them).\r\nThe range in the class was tremendous from freshman fresh from the Chinese training system\r\nfor the International Mathematical Olympiad (the highest-end competition for high school\r\nstudents), down to people who like math and writing, but had not had much experience with any\r\nmathematics beyond high school. I deliberately chose the students as the most interesting \"mix\"\r\nfrom among the large multiple of people who applied to take the class. A major part of our\r\ndiscussions involved the interactions between formal mathematical thinking and the real world.\r\nMs. Ellison was by nature a quiet person, but involved in discussions, and particularly thoughtful\r\nin her comments. She was by no means one of the extreme personalities in the class. I\r\nremember that she was knowledgeable about Eliezer Yudkowsky then (although I don't know her\r\nprecise opinion at the time).\r\nIn her more typical mathematical classes, she was a strong student throughout (and in the\r\nhonors algebra class I taught her, she was one of the strong sophomores in the class). As a math\r\nmajor she thrived, and I remember discussions about where she was going in the medium to long\r\nterm. I wrote her a recommendation letter for the coterminal masters program in computer\r\nscience (for which I presume she was an obvious choice). I seem to remember her telling me\r\nthat she was going to Jane Street, although that may be a false memory. At the time it was not Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 52 of 115\r\nclear to me what the future held, although the world was in some sense her oyster; her skills and\r\nstrengths could take her in many directions.\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nR.D.

When we are fortunate enough to be together in person, we play games,\r\ndiscuss books, and go hiking or sightseeing. More recently we have exchanged creative writing\r\nto stay connected remotely.\r\nOver the last decade, I have come to deeply value Caroline's imagination, intellect,\r\ncuriosity, and particular loyalty as a friend. As long as I have known her, Caroline has been\r\nconcerned about the state of the world, focused on using evidence-based methods to bring about\r\npositive change. Through a rationalist lens, she is committed to reducing human and animal\r\nsuffering on a local and global level. Her philanthropy, volunteer work, and veganism all reflect\r\nthat commitment. Our most sincere and passionate conversations have always been about forging\r\npaths toward political, social, and ecological progress. Her consistently rigorous arguments and\r\nwell-informed opinions center around the hope of achieving a higher quality of life for all.\r\nThough our personal philosophies may diverge on certain points, I appreciate Caroline's ability\r\nto respectfully and productively challenge my beliefs; our dialogue has helped us both grow, as\r\nwe enjoy and learn from our differences.\r\nIn the years to come, Caroline can and will use her vision, drive, and altruistic instinct to\r\nmake unique and lasting contributions to society. I am eager to see what she will choose to do\r\nwith her second chance, and optimistic about all that she can still accomplish. Not only for\r\nCaroline, but for those whose lives her work and ideas will uplift in the future, I strongly urge\r\nyou to be lenient in your sentencing.\r\nSincerely, Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT P\r\nPage 55 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 56 of 115\r\n5 January, 2024\r\nHon.

We lived very\r\nnear to her family for a year and became quite close with them. She was often at our apartment, and I\r\nfound her to be a mature and exceptionally intelligent child, one whose company I enjoyed. Our mutual\r\nlove for reading was (and still is!) a frequent topic. Over the years our families remained friends, and I\r\nwatched her grow up. I am a friend of her mother, but I have a separate relationship with Caroline. We\r\ncorresponded occasionally by email after she went off to college. Even after she grew busy with her studies\r\nand then career, she had time to write to an old friend. I have always considered her to be a good, kind,\r\nthoughtful person.\r\nWhen I started to hear about allegations of wrongdoing at FTX, it seemed unthinkable to me that\r\nCaroline could be involved. It took me a long time to accept that she could be part of any crimes. I could\r\nonly accept it after learning that she took responsibility for breaking the law. I still do not believe that\r\nCaroline intended any of this for personal gain. I can only imagine that she was breaking the law to try to\r\nprevent Alameda and FTX from defaulting. Ultimately, I can see how extremely difficult circumstances\r\nand pressures must have led her to this series of uncharacteristic decisions.\r\nI am sure that other people who have gotten to spend more time with Caroline have much more to say,\r\nbut I appreciate the chance to add my voice to those who support her.\r\nSincerely,\r\nBrienne\r\nBrienne E.

Lewis A Kaplan\r\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse\r\n500 Pearl Street\r\nNew York, NY 10007-1312\r\nPage 58 of 115\r\nDear Judge Kaplan:\r\nI write because I have learned that it is helpful to a judge to gain a fuller picture of individuals facing sentencing in his or\r\nher court. I am happy to provide some of this context for Caroline Ellison. I have known Caroline for her whole life.\r\nCaroline's father and I attended the same public high school in Connecticut and her parents were both students with me\r\nin the MIT economics PhD program. When I graduated in 1993, Sara and Glenn Ellison remained close friends. My\r\nhusband and I have lived in New Haven CT since 2001 and the Ellisons have lived in the Boston area since grad school.\r\nWe nonetheless have gotten together very frequently- hosting each other as houseguests, attending each other's\r\nbirthday parties, etc. Along with two other families that also have children of roughly our children's ages, we frequently\r\nvacation together in the summer. My husband and I have always considered ourselves lucky to have friends who, like us,\r\nwork hard but genuinely enjoy spending time with their children. This was a gift to us when the children were all\r\ntoddlers and preschoolers, but it still is now that the children are all young adults. Caroline and her parents visited our\r\nhome for such a gathering as recently as this summer.\r\nThrough these gatherings, I have gotten to know Caroline well. I have always known Caroline to be very hard-working,\r\nintelligent, and generous. She has always been low-key and down to earth. She helped with babysitting my youngest\r\nson when he was quite young. In more recent years, when we get together, the young people are most likely to go for a\r\nhike, play frisbee, play goofy lawn games, eat pizza, or play a board game. Caroline has always been amiable and fun;\r\nshe has never seemed particularly interested in glamour or being the center of attention. She is an avid reader and I\r\nhave enjoyed speaking with her about books that we have both read.\r\nOver these many years, I have also observed Caroline as a family member. She has always been close to her sisters and\r\nher parents. In this past year since her plea, Caroline has seemed calmly focused on using her time in ways that are\r\nhelpful and productive. Nonetheless, I have seen Caroline to be very visibly pained by her parents' sadness and concern.\r\nShe clearly feels how hard this has been on them. Despite this, I am confident that Caroline's strong relationship with\r\nher parents and her siblings has been and will continue to be an important source of strength to her.\r\nI hope that you find this letter helpful to you.\r\nSincerely,\r\nJudith A Chevalier\r\nJudith A Chevalier Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT R\r\nPage 59 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 60 of 115\r\nThe Honorable Lewis A.

I went to\r\ngraduate school with Caroline's parents and have known Caroline since she was born.\r\nOur families have spent quality time together regularly over the past thirty years. I am\r\nalso godmother to Caroline's younger sister.\r\nI understand that Caroline has confessed to crimes related to her time working at\r\nAlameda and I would like to provide some additional background information about her.\r\nGrowing up, Caroline was the quintessential first-born child-a conscientious hard-\r\nworking, rule-follower trying to lead an exemplary life.\r\nWhen we were all together, she was usually the oldest kid in the room helping the\r\nyounger children follow the rules of a game or remember their lines in a fun skit that she\r\nwrote. Attending Mass with her family, I observed teenage Caroline as a reverent and\r\nmeticulous altar server who guided the younger servers through their tasks at the church.\r\nBy college, she became more focused on charitable works; when she got her first real job\r\nafter graduation, she donated much of her earnings to animal welfare groups. Caroline\r\nwas out of the country when the pandemic began, making her visits to her family home\r\ndifficult; our contact with her became much less frequent at that time.\r\nGiven her upbringing, Caroline understands the gravity of making a confession and that\r\nan honest confession, though painful, is the necessary beginning of a journey of\r\nrepentance. I humbly ask that you consider her sincere efforts to confess and repent as\r\nyou determine her fate. I thank you for your consideration in this matter.\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nMant.

As my older cousin, Caroline\r\nhas been an influential presence in my life. Throughout the years, she has consistently shown\r\nkindness, friendliness, and intelligence. I have seen firsthand her commitment to her family and\r\nfriends, and as such I believe she has and can continue to have a positive impact on those around\r\nher. I sincerely hope I am able to help give some insight into her character and aid in her\r\nsentencing decision.\r\nAs a child, I knew her as a soft-spoken bookworm. I looked up to her for how cool-headed and\r\nmature she was, but was a bit intimidated by our age difference to spend quality time with her.\r\nWhile those traits have not changed, I feel I have gotten to know her much better since she has\r\nreturned to the country following the events of 2022. Since she has been around more, I have\r\nseen her when I can on holidays with our family or for visits in New York. When she is not\r\nreading, she can usually be found helping out around the house or spending quality time with her\r\nsisters. In the time I have spent visiting her apartment away from the rest of the family, it has\r\namazed me seeing how often she catches up with her immediate family, having detailed calls\r\nwith them very often. To me, she shows a deep love for her family by always knowing the latest\r\nabout her sisters, her parents, and their lives. She makes an effort with the rest of us as well,\r\nalways wanting to know what I or my boyfriend have going on. I always look forward to seeing\r\nher at family gatherings, knowing I can count on her to spare time for a board game, a nice\r\nlunch, or even just to give me a break from my younger brother.\r\nIn passing, she has mentioned spending her time in New York doing volunteer work at a tax\r\npreparation office and a soup kitchen. These seemed to be good experiences for her, fostering a\r\nstrong connection to her local community. While she hasn't shared many specifics, I hope her\r\ncommitment to assisting the community following her return can shed some light on her\r\ncharacter and dedication. I believe Caroline has shown true dedication to her family and\r\ncommunity, which demonstrates her caring nature and willingness to make a positive impact. I\r\nhave seen her dedication firsthand, and I genuinely believe that given the right guidance and\r\nsupport, she has the potential to continue contributing positively to society.\r\nSincerely,\r\nElizabeth Fisher Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT T\r\nPage 63 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 64 of 115\r\nDear Judge Kaplan:\r\nI know Caroline from middle and high school, where we were classmates for five years, and we\r\nremain friends, although we have gone separate ways. I know that she has pled guilty to serious\r\ncrimes associated with Alameda and FTX, and, and very much do not want to minimize the\r\nthings she did wrong. However, I hope that I can inform the court by providing a better picture of\r\nthe person she was when I knew her best, whose character, I think, is not well reflected in the\r\npublic narrative.\r\nThe person I knew was reserved, studious, responsible, and a good friend. Caroline and I were in\r\na physics class together, in which I think she was the only person to get an A; however, she\r\nspoke less than other people, and was, in general, not showy about her knowledge. She wasn't\r\nvery notorious at school, except for being a good student, but was well liked among people who\r\nknew her well, and took her leadership roles exceptionally seriously. I and other people respected\r\nthese things about her. She was interested in supporting others, especially in the math and\r\nlinguistics competitions she did, and gave more than she took away from these leadership\r\npositions.\r\nAgain, I have known Caroline for a long time, and we knew each other very well in high school.\r\nBased on everything I know of her, she wouldn't have wanted to take on a responsibility that she\r\ncouldn't or didn't intend to fulfill, and wouldn't have tried to benefit from failing her obligations.\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and I ask you to please take it into consideration. I\r\nwill be available to confirm the facts in this letter, and please do not hesitate to reach out if\r\nnecessary.\r\nSincerely.

She is part of my high school friend group. I\r\nhave had varying degrees of closeness with Caroline, but we were closest during the end of high\r\nschool and the first year or two of college (2011-2014). I have kept in touch sporadically with\r\nCaroline since then, but only for occasional dinners when we are in the same city.\r\nI respect any ruling of the court, and hope this letter can provide a fuller picture of Caroline as I\r\nhave known her. It was Caroline who introduced me to effective altruism some time in 2012 or\r\n2013, and I went to my first and only effective altruism meetup with her at MIT during that time.\r\nWe spent a significant portion of time during those years discussing the most effective way to\r\nmake a good impact on the world. I recall her believing strongly in the cause of altruism at that\r\ntime, and that she was intent on pursuing effective altruism to help people and make the world a\r\nbetter place.\r\nCaroline and I lost touch for a few years, but reunited in late June of 2022 at a friend's wedding.\r\nWe were both in San Francisco for a few days following the wedding, and we grabbed dinner one\r\nnight to reconnect. My recollection of this conversation is not perfect, but I will recount it to the\r\nbest of my ability. We discussed relationships during the dinner, with Caroline sharing that she\r\nhad gotten out of a bad relationship a few months before. I do not remember the details of the\r\nrelationship, but I do remember her emphasizing that it was not healthy and she was ready to move\r\non and date someone new. I have since come to learn the relationship she was talking about was\r\nwith Sam Bankman-Fried. We also discussed morality and ethics, which was a central part of our\r\nfriendship. I shared that I was struggling with my ethical framework, and Caroline said the same.\r\nShe voiced that she had some concerns about her role at work and the ethics associated with it. I\r\ndo not recall her going into further detail, but I left that conversation with the feeling that she was\r\nnot entirely comfortable with the ethical situation at her work, and spoke to my father sometime\r\nthat week about this exact conversation and shared these thoughts.\r\nI believe strongly that the Caroline I knew in late high school and early college truly believed that\r\neffective altruism would help make the world a better place. I hope my recollections above help\r\npaint a fuller picture of Caroline as a person, and I am happy to provide further detail as necessary.\r\nSincerely,\r\nDocuSigned by:\r\nLucia Grigoli\r\n-4C274030D485413...\r\nLucia Grigoli Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT V\r\nPage 67 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 68 of 115\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nI've known Caroline Ellison since a mutual friend of ours introduced her to our friend group about half a\r\nyear ago. I also met her briefly at the International Olympiad in Linguistics (IOL) in 2011, where she was a\r\ncontestant and I was chair of the problem committee. Caroline has diverse intellectual talents beyond her\r\nbackground as a mathematician, and is always willing to try new things, so her life is not likely to lead\r\nback in the direction of her crimes; she would have plenty of good, non-crypto things to do with her life\r\noutside prison.\r\n• As a contestant at the IOL, Caroline received an award for writing the best solution (out of 102\r\ncontestants representing 19 countries) to one of the 5 problems. She continued to help the US\r\nteam after 2011 by running a site of the US IOL team selection contest at Stanford, grading for\r\nthe contest, and editing problems, all as a volunteer.\r\n•\r\n•\r\n•\r\nShe ran a collaborative storytelling event in which she prepared a universe and backstories for a\r\ndozen characters whose stories her friends then told.\r\nShe is well-read and clever with words: for instance, she explained clever lines and references\r\nfrom Pride and Prejudice to mutual friends who missed them, and she's adept at word games.\r\nLately, she has been occupying her time by helping her father write a high school statistics\r\ntextbook.\r\nRegardless of what she chooses to do with her life going forward, it's clear that she has a lot to offer the\r\nworld.\r\nFurthermore, Caroline is kind and responsible. When my fiancée and I hosted a dinner party, she\r\nenthusiastically volunteered to help out and ended up joining the cooking for several hours. Before tax\r\nday, she spent time volunteering to help people with their tax returns. She helps other people feel\r\ncomfortable in conversations, contributing to the subject at hand but never dominating the room.\r\nFor these reasons and more, Caroline has become a valued member of our community despite being one\r\nof the newest additions; so I hope that she stays out of prison, or for whatever sentence you impose to be\r\nlenient.\r\nSincerely,\r\nadam Hesterberg\r\nDr. Adam Hesterberg Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT W\r\nPage 69 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 70 of 115\r\nRABBI DAVID KUDAN\r\n=\r\nAugust 1, 2024\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\nWe are writing in support of Caroline Ellison, whom we have known as a neighbor and family\r\nfriend for over twenty years.

Caroline has always been thoughtful,\r\nrespectful, and considerate in her actions. We have always believed that Caroline will make a\r\nsignificant contribution to the betterment of our society, in whatever field she seeks to apply her\r\nacumen and intelligence.

Caroline has\r\nbeen one of my best friends from when we played softball together in elementary school to\r\nI know her very well both as a person and\r\na friend.\r\nAs a person, Caroline is intelligent, determined, and curious about the world. She was always at\r\nthe top of our class, taking college courses in high school and competing in international math\r\nand linguistics competitions, but she remained humble and never bragged about her\r\naccomplishments. She is intellectually curious, constantly devouring books on a wide range of\r\ntopics.\r\nAs a friend, Caroline is considerate and fun to be around. She has always been empathically\r\nattuned to me, and was thoughtful in her actions towards me. As an example, her gifts were\r\nalways on the mark, as she would remember things I had liked from our mall excursions months\r\nearlier. She and I have spent countless days and nights driving around, playing games,\r\nlaughing, and enjoying each other's company. When we went to college on opposite coasts, the\r\nday-to-day quality of our friendship necessarily changed, but we always remained devoted to\r\nour friendship.\r\nI feel that a description of Caroline would be incomplete without describing her family. Her\r\nsiblings and parents have always welcomed me with open arms and made me feel like one of\r\ntheir own. They enjoy playing games together and traveling together, and her parents have\r\nmodeled for her and her sisters a strong dedication to family, career, and community. I have\r\nseen Caroline embody these same qualities.\r\nOver the past year, it has been a challenge to reconcile the friend I grew up with and the person\r\nin the news. Although I am disappointed in the choices Caroline made, I do believe, based on\r\nconversations I've had with her this year, that she recognizes her mistakes, is truly sorry, and\r\nwill not do anything like them again.\r\nSincerely, Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT Y\r\nPage 74 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 75 of 115\r\nDecember 14, 2023\r\nThe Honorable Lewis Kaplan,\r\nI am Katie Legge, Caroline Ellison's aunt. I will always be one of her biggest champions because\r\nshe is family, and I love her. But, I am also a high school teacher of 30 years. I have had the\r\nopportunity to work with thousands of young people over those years. My job is both difficult\r\nand rewarding, and I have learned quite a bit about young people. I have seen honesty and\r\ndishonesty, pride and contrition, concern and foolhardiness—frankly, I have pretty much seen\r\neverything come through my classroom. But my biggest \"take away\" from my time working\r\nwith young people is hope. Often, when students make a mistake (and they almost all do), they\r\ncome out better on the other side and give me great hope for the future.\r\nCaroline is my first niece. I was 24 when she was born, and from the beginning, she was\r\nspecial. She told her first joke at 11 months old. She was reading very early (she accidentally\r\nread Jurassic Park at age 6). I believe it was at about this same age that her math skills outpaced\r\nmine. She is smart; however, the thing that makes her truly special is her spirit. It is kind, naive,\r\ngentle, caring, tender, and fun. I have been lucky enough to be able to have had some\r\nwonderful adventures with Carrie. One I remember in particular was our Lewis and Clark\r\nexpedition. She, her sister Anna, and I made our own adventure. We researched Lewis and Clark\r\nat the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Then we found recipes and made some of the\r\nsnacks they would have had. We printed t-shirts to commemorate the experience, and we\r\nrented a canoe on the Charles River. While I had some struggles with this (the canoe day was\r\none of the hottest days in long time in Boston), Carrie loved it! She made all it worth it with her\r\npositive energy and sheer joy.\r\nCarrie has always wanted to help people. As a child, she wanted to help her parents and\r\ngrandparents. As her siblings and cousins started arriving, she wanted to help the younger\r\nkids. As she got older, she wanted to help her friends. And this grew to wanting to help as\r\nmany people (and animals) as possible in the world. She has always gotten joy and satisfaction\r\nfrom helping people—I love her selfless nature.\r\nWhen I had my daughter, I knew then and still believe now that she is lucky to have Carrie as a\r\ncousin. My daughter is 8 years younger than Carrie, but Carrie has always had such patience for\r\nthe younger kids in our family. She would creatively play with them, watch silly movies with\r\nthem, and just be an all-around role model for them. She is so much like her mother in that\r\nway. I see Carrie treating her siblings and cousins like my older sister always treated me, with\r\nconsideration and empathy. I also believe that these are special qualities—consideration and\r\nempathy are hard to fake—they are just part of Carrie's moral fiber.\r\nYes, I am biased, but not so much that I can't step back and view the whole picture.

Kaplan\r\nSenior Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nI am Roxy Legge, a graduate student in Indiana, and a cousin of Caroline's. She is eight\r\nyears older than me, and I have looked up to her my entire life.\r\nI am writing you to offer a more complete picture of Caroline. Growing up an only child, I\r\ngrew a very close bond with my cousins, which closely resembled the bond that siblings share. I\r\nsaw Caroline as an older sister figure, and deeply admired her for her intelligence and maturity.\r\nDespite our age difference, Caroline always took the time to make me feel important, asking\r\nquestions other relatives wouldn't remember to ask, sitting through my (likely insufferable) high\r\nschool plays, and being the first to congratulate me on my big wins. Through the years, I have\r\nwatched her do the same to our other family members. No matter how busy she gets, no\r\nmatter what she's accomplished, she always strives to make her family feel loved and important.\r\nIn a big, loud family like ours, it's easy to get lost in the sea of commotion. But Caroline has been\r\nthe lighthouse of our family, strong and steady, giving each individual the \"spotlight\" they need\r\nin that moment. I have no doubt that Caroline will take her intelligence and deep consideration\r\nfor others and apply it toward the betterment of society.\r\nI want to thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit more about Caroline from my\r\nperspective. Of course, if you need anything from this letter confirmed, I am available by phone\r\nor email.\r\nBest wishes,\r\nRheghl Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBITAA\r\nPage 79 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK\r\nFiled 09/10/24\r\nPage 80 of 115\r\nDocument 497-1\r\nKatie MacFarlane, PharmD\r\nWashington, DC\r\nHon. Lewis A. Kaplan\r\nUnited States Courthouse\r\n500 Pearl St.\r\nNew York, NY 10007\r\nDear Judge Kaplan:\r\nMy name is Katie MacFarlane, and I am writing to you to provide insight into the character of\r\nCaroline Ellison. I have known Caroline since she was a baby, and I am her godmother. Her mother\r\nand I were college roommates, and I have been a close friend of the Ellison family for over 30 years.\r\nI have spent time with Caroline both with her family and on her own, at her home and mine, as well\r\nas traveling, and she was an attendant in my wedding. I have seen Caroline's values develop as she\r\nhas grown up, and I know she is an honest and forthright person.\r\nCaroline has always been mature for her age, as she is very bright. I know that as a child her\r\nparents were often encouraged to \"jump\" her ahead a few grades in school, but they did not, as\r\nthey felt it was important for her to develop socially and Caroline agreed that she wanted friends\r\nher own age. I witnessed the strength of her friendships when she brought a group to stay with my\r\nhusband and me for a long weekend following high school graduation. We had the opportunity to\r\nchat with Caroline and her friends about many topics, from current events to their plans for the\r\nfuture. Caroline showed great compassion for those who are less fortunate, and it was an insight\r\ninto what would develop into her interest in working to alleviate poverty.\r\nI have witnessed Caroline's kindness and gentle nature in her interactions with her sisters and her\r\nfamily, and in conversations about the world around us. In my experience, she has always treated\r\nothers with respect and compassion. She has developed an understanding of the struggles of\r\nthose less fortunate through her volunteer work. Her quiet nature is non-threatening to others and\r\nmakes her approachable.\r\nI understand she has pled guilty, and I know she is remorseful and hopes to have a life where she\r\ncan be of service to others, and particularly help those who suffer in poverty. I have no doubt that\r\nCaroline will be a law-abiding citizen and a positive contributor to society.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatie MacFarlane\r\nKatie MacFarlane, PharmD\r\nFounder and President\r\nSmartPharma LLC\r\nAffiliate Faculty\r\nPurdue University College of Pharmacy Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT AB\r\nPage 81 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 82 of 115\r\nHARVARD Kennedy School\r\nJOHN F.

Since she\r\ncompleted AP Statistics in high school, she has a valuable perspective on this material as well as\r\ncoding skills that aren't familiar to me. Caroline has been working independently writing\r\nchapters on simulation and the use of Excel for analyzing data. Her thinking and writing is clear\r\nand concise and I feel as comfortable working with her as with any of my faculty colleagues.\r\nCaroline has also been a strong contributor and a clear positive presence in our weekly Zoom\r\nmeetings. I imagine that it must be challenging for anyone to figure out how to work effectively\r\nwith their parents. In our meetings, Caroline never seems self-conscious and is comfortable\r\nexpressing her opinions whether or not they overlap with the consensus of the prior conversation.\r\nMoreover, I have been impressed with Caroline's emphasis on making the text easier for high\r\nschool students to use rather than in trying to impress anyone with her knowledge.\r\nOn a personal level, I have enjoyed the opportunity to interact with Caroline through this project\r\nShe is a good listener and her comments are both creative, insightful, and funny. I would enjoy\r\nworking with her again and already have some ideas for possible future collaborations.\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nChustopher A\r\nвиз\r\nChristopher Avery Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT AC\r\nPage 83 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 84 of 115\r\nAugust 4, 2024\r\nDear Judge Kaplan:\r\nI met Caroline in college, in our second year at Stanford. We met through a mutual friend, but\r\ngrew closer while working together on problem sets in a notoriously difficult computer science\r\nclass. When we did the same study abroad program in junior year, Caroline became one of my\r\nclosest friends. We had a lot of shared interests, from fantasy novels to philosophy, from swing\r\ndancing to puzzles of all kinds. This made her an excellent classmate and travel companion as\r\nwe took field trips to study London architecture, strolled around Bath pretending to be\r\ncharacters in a Jane Austen novel, and won my first ever escape game (and then another one\r\nthe following week because we loved it so much).\r\nIn a lot of ways, Caroline was also an excellent role model for me. She was extremely smart and\r\nthoughtful, as well as a kind and giving friend - for my 21st birthday, she made me an involved\r\nand very difficult scavenger hunt that had me doing binary math in history class. And since I met\r\nher, she's been fully committed to doing what she can to make the world better. Her ethics\r\nunderpinned so much of what she did, even in college. Talking with her about this pushed me to\r\nthink carefully about my privilege, my responsibilities towards others, and how I could do good.\r\nOne example of this is how Caroline inspired me to think more critically about my diet. I went\r\nvegetarian the first year of college, but I was pretty content to pat myself on the back for that\r\nand call it a day. Caroline and a few of our other friends were also vegetarian, and in addition to\r\nseeking out great veggie-focused food together, we talked a lot about this. In one of those\r\nconversations, Caroline said she was working to cut eggs out of her diet for ethical reasons.\r\nThis pushed me to consider my own choices more carefully. I'm now fully vegan - and still\r\nthinking about how I can do better - and I look back at this conversation as the point that kicked\r\noff that transition. This is something that's extremely important to me, and I'm grateful to\r\nCaroline for pushing me to do better here.\r\nCaroline also thought a lot about how she could have a positive impact on the world through\r\ngiving money, and her example led me to do the same. She approached this through the lens of\r\neffective altruism - using rational analysis to identify how we can do the most good (for\r\nexample, saving the most lives per dollar spent), and then doing that fully. She even took an\r\noath our senior year to give a certain percentage of her income every year to the most effective\r\ncharities. She was my first introduction to this way of thinking about your impact, and this\r\nmethodology has underpinned my own decision making about my charitable donations. Thanks\r\nto Caroline, I now give more, and work to ensure that what I give is doing as much good as\r\npossible.\r\nCaroline and I fell largely out of touch a few years after college. When the news about FTX's\r\ncollapse and her involvement in it broke, I was shocked and sickened. Nothing about the case\r\nas I initially understood it could square with my conception of her as a whip-smart, caring, and\r\ndeeply moral person. Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 85 of 115\r\nWhen I've spoken with Caroline since the collapse of FTX, what's stuck out most to me is her\r\ndeep remorse not just for her actions but for the impact they've had. She has spent her life\r\ntrying to do as much good as possible, and she feels that now, no matter what she does with the\r\nrest of her life, her impact will be net negative. Her grief about this helped me see that she still is\r\nthe person who was my close friend and role model in college. Even if she can't undo the harm\r\nshe did, she is still working to do good, for the people around her and for the world at large.\r\nSincerely,\r\nEllei Redd's\r\nEllie Redding Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT AD\r\nPage 86 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 87 of 115\r\nDear Judge Lewis A. Kaplan,\r\nI'm writing as a childhood friend of Caroline Ellison. We were classmates at Bigelow\r\nMiddle School in Newton and teammates on the Bigelow math team.\r\nSince then we've gone our separate ways, I to Washington D.C. as a technology\r\nconsultant, and Caroline to her FTX exploits. Like much of America, I've been following the\r\nFTX saga and was glad to see Caroline do the right thing and begin cooperating with the\r\ngovernment. That's the Caroline I knew, and the person I believe she truly is, events of recent\r\nyears notwithstanding.\r\nYou don't leave middle school with assessments of most people's character―we were,\r\nafter all, children-but Caroline truly stood out in her unfailing kindness. My best friend from\r\nchildhood (also of the Bigelow math team) has had a lifelong stutter, and this drew some\r\nmeasure of attention from the schoolyard bullies, even reducing him to tears at times. But\r\nnothing of the sort occurred in the social environments we shared with Caroline: she saw to that,\r\nleading by example. Caroline consistently helped create positive and compassionate spaces\r\nwhere many of my fondest memories of middle school were formed.\r\nI believe Caroline has the potential still to positively impact numerous people's lives in\r\nthe years and decades to come, as she did ours in adolescence. I hope this snapshot of what\r\nCaroline was like in a time and place when nobody was watching, and we were simply our\r\ngenuine selves, can be taken into consideration in the remainder of her proceedings.\r\nMost respectfully,\r\nDan Wang\r\nDan Meny Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT AE\r\nPage 88 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 89 of 115\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nI am writing this letter in my personal capacity in support of Caroline Ellison's sentencing.\r\nI first met Caroline around 2010, when I believe she was in high school. Caroline's parents -\r\nGlenn and Sara Ellison - were my senior colleagues in my first job after finishing school. Glenn\r\nand Sara were extremely welcoming of their new junior colleagues, and - for example - invited\r\nmy partner and I over for dinner at their house a number of times, as well as hosting broader\r\nevents for our department at their home, and my memory is that all three of their daughters\r\nwould usually be around when we would visit.\r\nThat said, I also knew of Caroline and her two sisters before I met them - their reputation\r\npreceded them in the most positive way possible. The most succinct description I can think of is\r\nto say that my sense is that for a wide generation of people many years older younger and many\r\nyears older than me who knew Glenn and Sara, their three daughters were perceived as the\r\ntypes of kids we all hoped to be so lucky as to raise ourselves. All three girls were generally\r\nperceived as brilliant, kind, thoughtful, and generous, and all of those impressions were\r\ncompletely confirmed in my interactions with them.\r\nI realize that my interactions with Caroline may seem rare and somewhat superficial. At the\r\nsame time, as a mother, it's hard for me to think of a higher complement than to say that Glenn\r\nand Sara's three daughters seemed so exemplary that I remember often going to them for\r\nparenting advice, on how my partner and I could try to raise thoughtful, well-adjusted, kind\r\nchildren like their girls.\r\nHeidi Williams\r\nHeidi Lie Williams Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT AF\r\nPage 90 of 115 Case 1:22 cr 00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 91 of 115\r\nJune 4, 2024\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nWe are the staff of\r\n\"\r\na -year-old nonprofit based in\r\ndedicated to sending free books to people in prisons and jails across the country.

While she has done multiple different roles, she\r\ngravitates most towards invoicing, which involves crafting a unique, personal note of\r\nencouragement to each recipient. Invoicing requires kindness, empathy, thoughtfulness, and\r\ncompassion in addition to attention to detail, all of which she has admirably demonstrated.\r\nCaroline has had a perfect attendance record and is always on time. She is quiet but helpful\r\nwith other people at her table, including people of all ages, identities, and backgrounds. She\r\nhas become a trusted expert at her tasks and can answer questions from new volunteers.\r\nBased upon what we know about Caroline as a member of our community, we would urge\r\nleniency in sentencing. Based upon our extensive knowledge of American correctional\r\nsystems, we can say with certainty that sentencing her to a term of incarceration will\r\naccomplish little of value for anyone, including victims, and will only cause further harm.\r\nThank you for your consideration.\r\nSincerely, Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT AG\r\nPage 92 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 93 of 115\r\nDear Judge Kapan,\r\nMy name is\r\nand I am the Site Manager of\r\nis part of the\r\na public service department that provides ESOL, literacy, numeracy, and high school\r\nequivalency classes to young adults and adults in\r\nI am writing to inform you that Caroline Ellison is currently a tutor in good standing at the\r\nand has been volunteering since November 2023.

Caroline Ellison (22 Cr. 673 (LAK))\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nI am the Chief Executive Officer of FTX Trading Ltd. and its affiliated debtors\r\nand debtors-in-possession (collectively, “FTX” or the “Debtors”) in the chapter 11 cases (the\r\n“Chapter 11 Cases\") now pending before Judge John T. Dorsey of the United States Bankruptcy\r\nCourt for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). I write on behalf of FTX in\r\nconnection with Caroline Ellison's sentencing, currently scheduled for September 24, 2024. As\r\nset forth more fully below, Ms. Ellison has provided the Debtors with valuable assistance and\r\ncooperation, which resulted in the recovery of hundreds of millions of dollars in Debtor assets\r\nfor the benefit of creditors. Ms. Ellison also has agreed to provide further assistance and\r\ncooperation on an ongoing and prospective basis.\r\nBackground\r\nI was appointed as CEO of FTX by Samuel Bankman-Fried during the early\r\nmorning hours of November 11, 2022 (the “Petition Date”) by his execution and delivery of the\r\nOmnibus Corporate Authority attached to this letter as Exhibit A. I have over three decades of\r\nexperience in complex multi-national restructurings and asset recovery exercises, first as a\r\nlawyer, as both external and internal counsel, and then leading the restructuring and asset\r\nrecovery efforts as the senior business person. Among the matters I have led include Enron,\r\nNortel Networks US, Overseas Shipholding Group and Residential Capital.\r\nI report to an independent and experienced board of directors comprised of\r\nMatthew A. Doheny, Rishi Jain, Matthew R. Rosenberg and Mitchell I. Sonkin, each of whom\r\nhave decades of experience in complex restructurings and asset recovery exercises involving\r\nsuch companies as MBIA, Residential Capital, Covanta Energy, USG, Yellow Corporation, and\r\nNortel Networks US, as well as the Honorable Joseph J. Farnan, Jr. (Ret.), the former chief judge\r\nof the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and former United States\r\nAttorney for the District of Delaware (collectively, the \"Board\"). Prior to the Petition Date,\r\nneither I nor any of the Board members had any connection with FTX, Ms. Ellison, or any of the\r\nother leaders of the FTX Group. Judge Dorsey has repeatedly found that both I and the Board\r\nare independent and highly qualified to lead the Debtors.\r\n-1- Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nFTX\r\nPage 98 of 115\r\nThe FTX Bankruptcy and Ms. Ellison's Assistance\r\nThe challenges that the Debtors' advisors faced in the days following the\r\ncommencement of the Chapter 11 Cases as a result of FTX's lack of appropriate record keeping\r\nand controls in critical areas—including, among others, management and governance, finance\r\nand accounting, as well as digital asset management, information security and cybersecurity―\r\nare by now well-documented. Within twenty-four hours of the commencement of the Chapter 11\r\nCases, Ms. Ellison began assisting the Debtors' bankruptcy advisors by identifying and securing\r\nestate assets. For example, Ms. Ellison participated in a number of lengthy video calls with the\r\nDebtors' advisors (two of which I personally participated in) during which she assisted the\r\nDebtors' advisors in transferring hundreds of millions of dollars of Debtor cryptocurrency assets\r\nfrom third-party exchanges and accounts to secure cold storage wallets. Where Ms. Ellison was\r\nnot able personally to assist in securing assets, e.g., in situations where FTX's access to a third-\r\nparty exchange had been suspended, she provided information regarding the location of the\r\nassets, their approximate dollar value, and contact information for individuals who might be able\r\nto assist in preserving them for the estate. This early cooperation was valuable in helping the\r\nDebtors' advisors protect and preserve assets and understand FTX's systems so that they could\r\nbegin to institute governance and controls.\r\nMs. Ellison, through her counsel, has also worked with the Debtors' advisors to\r\nanswer technical questions and provide information regarding private keys to cryptocurrency\r\nwallets that contain estate assets, DeFi positions, FTX exchange internal account information,\r\nthe use of third-party exchanges for pre-petition trading, and pre-petition auditing practices. Ms.\r\nEllison has, through her counsel, also made substantial productions of documents to the Debtors\r\nin response to legal process.\r\nAs the Court may know, the Debtors filed an adversary proceeding in the\r\nBankruptcy Court against Ms. Ellison and other former FTX insiders, including Mr. Bankman-\r\nFried, asserting claims for, among other things, breach of fiduciary, waste of corporate assets and\r\nfraudulent transfers of estate assets. The Debtors are working to finalize a settlement with Ms.\r\nEllison, subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, pursuant to which Ms. Ellison will turn\r\nover to the Debtors substantially all of her remaining assets after satisfying her forfeiture\r\nobligations, and provide ongoing cooperation, including by making herself available to testify as\r\nneeded, voluntarily providing documents and information, reviewing and clarifying documents,\r\nlocating and retrieving assets, and answering questions from the Debtors' advisors. Given Ms.\r\nEllison's senior position within the FTX Group prior to Chapter 11 Cases, her extensive\r\nknowledge of FTX's systems and processes, and her personal involvement in many key events\r\nand transactions, the Debtors expect that her cooperation will continue to be important to\r\nmaximize recovery for the creditors.\r\nRespectfully yours,\r\n-2-\r\nJohn J.

Samuel Bankman Fried, Caroline Ellison\r\nDear Judge Kaplan,\r\nWe represent the putative class of FTX customers who filed suit against FTX Insiders,\r\nincluding Ms. Caroline Ellison, Mr. Gary Wang, and Mr. Nishad Singh, as well as the venture\r\ncapital firms, law firms, accounting firms, banks, and other third parties alleged to have aided and\r\nabetted the FTX fraud in In re FTX Cryptocurrency Exchange Collapse Litigation, 1:23-md-\r\n03076, a multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of Florida (the “MDL”). Our\r\nclients represent the largest number of victims of the crimes for which Defendant Sam Bankman-\r\nFried was convicted, and their losses exceed $8 billion.\r\nMs. Ellison has provided valuable assistance to the MDL Plaintiffs, and we write to inform\r\nyou of her cooperation. To date, she has met with MDL Counsel for several hours, and has agreed\r\nto as many as ten additional meetings with MDL Counsel, to answer questions and to provide\r\ninformation helpful to MDL Plaintiffs' cases against alleged third-party aider-abettors. In those\r\nmeetings, Ms. Ellison has expressed sincere remorse for the role that she played in the FTX fraud\r\nand for the harm that she may have inflicted on MDL Plaintiffs. Ms. Ellison has also produced\r\ndocuments to MDL Counsel to aid them in the cases against certain MDL Defendants.\r\nThe information that Ms. Ellison has provided to MDL Counsel thus far has proven very\r\nhelpful to MDL Plaintiffs' cases. In particular, Ms. Ellison shared approximately 7000 pages of\r\ndirect text messages between certain MDL Defendants, FTX, and Alameda Research, LLC\r\n(\"Alameda\") and other details previously unknown to the public that not only substantiate, and\r\nsupplement, the allegations set forth in MDL Plaintiffs' complaints, but also should assist in\r\ndefeating certain MDL Defendants' jurisdictional defenses. For example, Ms. Ellison shared with\r\nMDL Plaintiffs documents and testimony supporting MDL Plaintiffs' allegations that MDL\r\nDefendant Deltec Bank (“Deltec\"), an offshore bank located in The Bahamas that serviced FTX\r\nand Alameda accounts:\r\n•\r\nIndividually identified incoming FTX customer deposits and manually\r\ntransferred those deposits into Alameda's Deltec bank account daily, though\r\nDeltec knew those incoming deposits belonged to FTX customers.\r\nSecretly helped the cryptocurrency firm Tether Limited to increase the\r\nmarket price and capitalization of its stablecoin “USDT\" by offering Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 101 of 115\r\ninducements to Alameda to use FTX customer funds to mint USDT, which\r\nAlameda could immediately sell at a profit; and\r\nExtended a secret de facto line of credit to FTX Group that sometimes\r\nexceeded 2 billion U.S. dollars, without which Defendant Bankman Fried\r\ncould not have perpetuated the FTX fraud.\r\nDeltec had succeeded in keeping this information from MDL Plaintiffs until Ms. Ellison shared it\r\nwith them, and MDL Counsel is grateful for Ms. Ellison's cooperation to date and as MDL\r\nPlaintiffs' cases proceed.\r\nMDL Counsel hopes that this Court will consider Ms. Ellison's expressed remorse and\r\nsignificant assistance to MDL Plaintiffs in rendering her sentence on September 24.\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\nBy: /s/ Adam Moskowitz\r\nAdam M.

In particular:\r\nextreme mood swings\r\nminor things get me very upset and put me into negative spirals that it's hard to recover\r\nfrom\r\n• sensitive to things that feel like slights or insults\r\n• easily overwhelmed, stressed out, and discouraged\r\n• crying a lot, spending a lot of time resisting the urge to cry\r\nbouts of feeling lonely\r\nbouts of feeling like my life is dark and hopeless\r\n● fragile self-esteem, interpreting minor mistakes or critical feedback as me being terrible\r\nI was wondering whether this would be worse when I was on vacation. Maybe something is\r\ngoing on like: I'm depressed, most of the time I'm distracting myself with work and artificially\r\nboosting my mood with Adderall, and now that I'm not on drugs and have a bunch of time and\r\nspace to think I'll stop repressing my feelings so much and everything will come out.\r\nInstead, I've been quite emotionally stable the whole time I've been on vacation. I haven't been\r\nsuper happy the whole time: partly I've been both sick and jetlagged, making me pretty\r\ntired/out of it a lot of the time. But generally my mood has been somewhere between \"happy\"\r\nand \"ehh.\" I've taken failures, setbacks, and criticism well and avoided getting into any negative\r\nspirals.\r\nSo here are some thoughts:\r\nThis really needs to stop.\r\nI think my mood for the past couple months qualifies as borderline clinical depression (at least\r\naccording to a quiz I took online). It definitely makes me less effective at work. It also just sucks.\r\nI'm not willing to feel like this long-term and need to do something to stop it, one way or\r\nanother.\r\nWhat's causing it?\r\nSome potential culprits:\r\n●\r\nwork stress\r\nisolation in Hong Kong\r\n•\r\nSam Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 106 of 115\r\nThese all fit with the fact that I've been feeling fine for the past week:\r\n•\r\n●\r\nI haven't been working or paying much attention to/feeling responsible for work\r\nI've been spending all my time around people\r\n• I haven't been interacting with Sam (or thinking about him much prior to writing this\r\ndoc)\r\nWhat are the potential solutions?\r\nI could try addressing the causes, or try other stuff.\r\nAddressing the causes:\r\nmove toward working less and cutting back on responsibility\r\n○ this would only address 1\r\n○ it's also hard, since the current situation of Alameda has basically been pushing\r\nme in the opposite direction\r\no historically I feel like whenever people at Alameda do this it's usually the first\r\nO\r\nstep toward them quitting\r\neven if that's not the case I feel like not going for job growth and increased\r\nresponsibility at Alameda makes it a significantly less appealing option compared\r\nto other jobs, both in terms of direct impact and career capital\r\nmove back to Berkeley\r\naddresses 1 and 2, and to some extent 3\r\nO\r\n○\r\notherwise basically all of the above apply\r\nquit\r\nO addresses 1, 2, and 3\r\nsomehow get Sam to date me\r\nO addresses 3 and to some extent 2\r\nOther stuff I could try (note that much of this requires working somewhat less, since I don't\r\nreally have any free time right now):\r\ndating:\r\nTinder dates, etc\r\nO O O O Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 107 of 115\r\nsee a doctor and get checked out for general health stuff\r\nget more and brighter lights\r\n○ I think my current bright light in the office def improves my mood\r\n• sleep more\r\n•\r\nexercise\r\nOk so what's the plan?\r\nAlso want to talk through this with:\r\nwhen I get back to HK\r\nFurther introspection:\r\nI do feel like there's a lot of feelings stuff going on that I haven't quite explained/worked\r\nthrough, and maybe if I spent more time on introspection/reframing that would be helpful.\r\nThis speaks in favor of therapy, talking to people, and also just thinking about stuff.\r\nI wonder if maybe a lot of stuff traces back to feeling romantically rejected by Sam.\r\nI think when Sam and I are sleeping together, or are in \"flirty mode,\" I feel better about work\r\nand life, and don't have the same negative spirals.\r\nA lot of what stresses me out about work is specifically failing Sam, or Sam's disapproval or\r\nsomething. I get easily upset when he disagrees with me or criticizes me, in a way that I don't\r\nthink I get upset if other people do the same things. Maybe I feel like: Sam is rejecting me for\r\nnot being good enough, and then everything else he says or does is just rubbing this in.\r\nI think I feel like:\r\n•\r\nSam doesn't love me because I'm not good enough for him\r\n• I can become good enough for him, by:\r\nO working harder\r\no being more reliable and on top of things Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 108 of 115\r\no being more productive\r\n○\r\nbeing a good manager/leader\r\no being less emotional/needy\r\no being less shallow and concerned with trivialities/appearances\r\nO having good judgment/being right about stuff\r\no being confident and self-possessed\r\no being more assertive\r\n○ trading my interests for his\r\nSam's rejection is really painful. I deal with it in varying ways:\r\n•\r\nsometimes I believe that I can be good enough. then I feel motivated and work hard on\r\nall of the above things\r\nthen I get evidence that I can't. this can take the form of me doing something wrong,\r\nSam disagreeing with me, etc\r\nthis makes me sad\r\nthe fact that I feel sad about this is itself evidence that I'm not good enough, since Sam's\r\nideal woman would base her actions on her own judgments of what's good and not care\r\nwhat Sam thinks about her\r\n• further evidence makes me more sad -> positive feedback loop of sadness\r\n●\r\nI feel despair and feel like there's no hope of him ever loving me\r\n•\r\nthen I just feel angry and hurt and want to lash out\r\n●\r\nthis makes me want to be as pathetic as possible, so he'll feel bad for hurting me\r\nIs this reasonable?\r\nIt's not totally wrong.\r\nIt is true that people's feelings for people tend to be based on characteristics of those people,\r\nand Sam values many of the above qualities.\r\nOther things that are true:\r\n● He's said that he would want to date me were it not for Alameda.\r\n•\r\nHe is only one person, and he has biases and blind spots. His judgment isn't perfect.\r\n.\r\nHe has fucked-up beliefs about relationships.\r\no His avoidant attachment style means that he fixates on flaws as a way to avoid\r\ncommitment and getting close to people.\r\no Literally no one is good enough for him, that's the point.

They have reasonable lists, and then\r\nI'm better off trying to be the best version of me than trying to be someone I'm not.\r\nThat doesn't mean I shouldn't try to improve but I should be honest with myself about\r\nwhat I'm naturally good at and interested in, and what I'm not.\r\nPersonal identity is fake, the idea of objective goodness is fake, everything is fake.\r\nI think I've been undervaluing the importance of these feelings for a while since I wanted to\r\nbelieve a narrative where I've gotten more secure and confident about this stuff, because that's\r\nthe narrative where I am good enough.\r\nPart of me feels like all this introspection. this \"I have to work through my feelings,\" thinking\r\nabout exercise and therapy and whatever are just dumb, when I'm fighting a really uphill battle\r\nto be happy or even okay in this situation and I should just quit.\r\nPartly I'm not sure why I don't want to quit, and I'm worried the reasons to stay are all\r\ngenerated within the framework of “be good enough for Sam” making them suspect.

When I'm working, to some extent I\r\nfeel like I'm on all the time, even when I'm not at work. Once I'm on vacation, after the\r\nfirst couple days, I find it hard to do something like \"try to pay attention to and address\r\nonly the most important things.\"\r\n。\r\nо\r\nI think this mostly comes down to storing state in my head.\r\nTo some extent, I have to reload a bunch of state every day, but a lot carries over\r\nfrom day to day.\r\nOnce I'm gone for more than a day or two it feels like I'm missing too much to\r\nreally do anything.\r\n。 Conversely, when the state is all in my head I end up replying to messages and\r\nchecking on stuff even when not at work.\r\nThe amount of adderall I've been taking has crept up slowly over the past couple years,\r\nfrom 10-15 -> 20.\r\nо\r\nо\r\nо\r\nThe first day of vacation I tried going off cold turkey, that did not feel good.\r\nThen I tried tapering from 10 to 7.5 to 5 and I felt really good on that.\r\nThe taper meant I never felt too out of it, but some combo of lower dose and lots\r\nof free time had a bunch of great physical/mental effects.\r\nI slept great.\r\n。 8-9 hours a night\r\no\r\nconsistent schedule\r\nnever had trouble getting to sleep (in fact the impetus for falling asleep most\r\nnights was \"too tired to keep my eyes open\" which it never is normally)\r\nfelt good upon waking and would get right out of bed (normally huge struggle)\r\n。 other stuff that prob affected this: lack of screens, low stress level\r\nI had no interest in normal \"mind-numbing\" activities I usually spend a lot of time on and\r\neven found them unpleasant\r\nTV\r\n。 social media\r\n。 podcasts\r\nInstead I was drawn to reading, writing, thinking\r\nI was more into healthy eating and craved salads\r\n• My mind felt opened up and creative\r\nConclusions:\r\n• Right now I basically do a bad cycle a lot of the time of sleep deprivation -> take more\r\nadderall can't get to sleep-> repeat\r\nI think a good night's sleep is probably equivalent in productivity to about 7.5 mg\r\nadderall, with a much nicer side effect profile\r\nELLISON_GOOGLE_00002316 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nI wanna try to\r\nо\r\nTake one day off a week\r\nO Work 9-11 hours/day\r\n0\r\nGo outdoors once a week\r\nPage 112 of 115\r\n• Keep in touch with friends better\r\nO\r\nAvoid screens before bed\r\n。 Figure out better ways to filter information and speed up getting context\r\nо\r\nDo more adulting things\r\nо Move in with roommates??\r\n0\r\nTake adderall back down to 15 mg\r\n9\r\nELLISON GOOGLE_00002317 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nEXHIBIT AN\r\nPage 113 of 115 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 497-1 Filed 09/10/24\r\nPage 114 of 115\r\nI feel like I haven't been doing well at work lately.\r\nWhat does this consist of?\r\n⚫ I feel generally unproductive\r\n⚫it's hard to motivate myself to go to work\r\na lot of the time I'm in the office I feel like I'm scrolling aimlessly through slack, etc\r\nI haven't been feeling confident lately\r\n⚫ I haven't been taking a lot of strong stances or getting excited about projects\r\nI've been quiet in the office\r\nWhy is this happening?

    "news_content": "Advertisement A PDF version of this document with embedded text is available at the link below: Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 407-15 Filed 02/27/24 Page 1 of 6\nDear Judge Kaplan:\nI am Sam Bankman-Fried's mother. I am also a law professor at Stanford, where I have taught\nfor the past thirty-five years, and before that was an attorney at Paul Weiss in New York and a\nlaw clerk on the Second Circuit. Because of my profession, I have witnessed my son's\nprosecution through two very different sets of eyes. For today, I speak only as his mother.\nSam is not like most other people, and any effort to understand him through the lens of\n'normal' behavior and motivations is going to misunderstand him. I want to talk about the Sam 1\nknow, in the hope that what I have to say will shed light on his motivations and actions and\nwhat would constitute a just and humane punishment in this case.\nIt is easy to be cynical about others' professed motives to do good in the world. It is even easier\nin Sam's case, because the only thing the world knows about him is his connection to what has\nbeen described relentlessly in the media over the past year as 'the fraud of the century,' and his\nportrayal as a cartoonish villain driven by greed. That public perception of Sam could not be\nfurther from the truth of who he is and how he has lived.\nAlmost all of us are egoists; we cannot help but put ourselves first and see the world as an\nextension of ourselves and our own desires. From a very early age Sam was different. When he\nwas about four, we were eating breakfast outside with friends. A woman came over to our\ntable and said, \"Is he your son,\" pointing to Sam. I looked over at him and nodded. A toddler\nhad fallen on the ground and Sam was kneeling next to her, trying to help her up. She said to\nme, \"He is an unusually empathetic child.\" I was taken aback to have a total stranger say that to\nme, because I hadn't thought about Sam in that way before. As Sam got older, that part of him\nbecame more apparent.\nHe was a quiet child, introverted, and demanded and desired very little attention from the\noutside world. But he was paying close attention to others.\nIn high school, he became a magnet for classmates who were sad, depressed, living through a\ndifficult parental divorce. He would occasionally ask our advice on behalf of a troubled\nclassmate, but for the most part kept his (and their) counsel and did what he could for them. In\nretrospect, it is clear both why those classmates were drawn to him and he to them. As the\nwhole world now knows, Sam has battled depression his entire life. We, his parents, were slow\nto recognize it because he worked hard to mask it and managed to function at a high level\ndespite it. He finally sought treatment about eight years ago. It has made a big difference in his\nlife, but the sadness at his core remains a constant presence. That he has managed to\naccomplish so much in his life notwithstanding it is a testament to his determination to make\nhis life count.\nHis desire to help others was manifest in other ways in high school. Bored by school himself, he\norganized review sessions for the other students in his physics class the night before every\nexam. The other students brought pizza, and he stayed until the last question had been asked\n1\nEx. A-14 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 407-15 Filed 02/27/24 Page 2 of 6\nand answered. At math camp the summer after 9th grade, he was introduced to the Puzzle\nHunt, a legendary day-long scavenger hunt at MIT, in which the clues are challenging\nbrainteasers. The following year he organized and ran his own Puzzle Hunt for Bay-area high\nschool students, to share with them the pleasures of the Hunt. He worked for weeks to\nprepare, writing clues, recruiting participants, and handled all the logistical arrangements. It\nwas a smash hit with the hundreds of participants, and he went on to sponsor two more before\nhe left for college.\nSometime in middle school Sam began to think more systematically and globally about ethical\nobligations. One day, when he was about twelve, he popped out of his room to ask me a\nquestion about an argument made by Derik Parfit, a well-known moral philosopher. As it\nhappens, I am quite familiar with the academic literature Parfit's article is a part of, having\nwritten extensively on related questions myself. His question revealed a depth of\nunderstanding and critical thinking that is not all that common even among people who think\nabout these issues for a living. 'What on earth are you reading?' I asked. The answer, it turned\nout, was he was working his way through the vast literature on utilitarianism, a strain of moral\nphilosophy that argues that each of us has a strong ethical obligation to live so as to alleviate\nthe suffering of those less fortunate than ourselves. The premises of utilitarianism obviously\nresonated strongly with what Sam had already come to believe on his own, but gave him a\nmore systematic way to think about the problem and connected him to an online community of\nlike-minded people deeply engaged in the same intellectual and moral journey.\nWhile he was still in high school, Sam started to think hard about the implications of\nutilitarianism for how he should live his life. His conversion to veganism was one outgrowth of\nthat quest. Sam lived on steak and fries until he was eighteen years old. After looking into the\ntreatment of factory farm animals in his freshman year at college, he became a vegetarian.\nAfter looking more deeply into it, he became a vegan. His determination to remain vegan in\nprison, where the absence of vegan food has forced him to live on commissary junk food,\nreveals a lot about his strength of character and moral commitment. He has lost 30 pounds\nsince he was remanded to prison in August. He has never once complained to us or, as far as I\nknow, the prison authorities. He has just made do, because it was important enough to him to\ndo so.\nThere is great nobility in his indifference to his own happiness, but there is also great sadness\nfor us as parents. After everything came apart in November 2022, Sam shared a lot of things\nwith his dad and me that he had never said before. We knew about his depression, but he\ndescribed something deeper and sadder: that he has never felt happiness or pleasure in his life\nand does not think he is capable of feeling it. His shared with us his private written reflections\non his experience of anhedonia going back a decade at least. That is a hard thing for a parent to\nlearn, and I of course argued with his self-diagnosis, throwing out every counterexample I could\nthink of. \"Weren't you happy when you were doing such and such?,\" I said, thinking of the\npicture of him on the mantle with a broad grin. He said, \"No. But I've learned how to pretend\nfor the sake of others.\" In the end, I am in no position to argue him out of his subjective\nexperience of life. I mention it now, only because it may explain in part why he has been so\n2\nEx. A-14 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 407-15 Filed 02/27/24 Page 3 of 6\nunconflicted about devoting his life to the happiness of others and so little interested in his\nown.\nWhile in high school, he also started to think seriously about the implications of utilitarianism\nfor his work life, talking to lots of people about what the most valuable use of his talents might\nbe if his goal was to improve the wellbeing of others. While at MIT, with advice from others,\nSam found an answer to the question. He decided to use his quantitative skills in a high-paying\njob in finance and give away his earnings to the most effective charitable organizations working\nin areas he cared most about. In short, like many other young idealistic people in his\ngeneration, he chose a life of earning to give. After graduation he took a job as a trader at Jane\nStreet Capital, an elite Wall Street quantitative trading firm, where he excelled. In his three\nyears there, he gave away over half of his earnings. Characteristically, he never told us--a friend\nof his did. He has never been interested in praise, and has always deflected it.\nIn 2017, he left Jane Street to start Alameda and then, in 2019, FTX. For the next three years,\nhe worked seven days a week, typically 20 hours a day, to build the company. His father and I\nof course worried about how hard he was driving himself and the costs to his mental and\nphysical health, but he dismissed us out of hand. He told us he didn't care about himself; all he\ncared about was living long enough to make a significant difference in the world. During the\nfirst two years of FTX's existence, he reinvested almost all of his substantial share of the profits\nin the company. By the third year, he felt the company was on solid enough footing that he\ncould begin to give away a portion of his earnings to charitable endeavors he believed in. The\nvaccine research project he sponsored was probably the highest impact gift he made in 2022,\nbut there were many others, and many more promising projects in the works with potentially\nhuge impact on the lives of the least well off that were cut off by the FTX implosion.\nSam's desire to do good on a large scale never crowded out his concern for individuals. In his\nsenior year at MIT, the father of his close friend Matt Nass died\nWe\nwere the first people called, because of our close relationship to both Matt and his father. Matt\nwas extremely close to his father. We were worried about the shock to Matt of learning of his\ndeath and didn't want to tell him until he had someone with him for moral support.\nUnfortunately, we were 3000 miles away. We called Sam, who was in school in Boston, and\nasked if he would drive out to Western Massachusetts to be with Matt. Sam's natural kindness\nand levelheadedness made him the obvious choice. We had been planning to call Matt to tell\nhim the news once Sam arrived, but Sam told Matt himself, took him back to MIT, stayed up\nplaying board games all night with him, and then took him to the airport the next day and\nstayed with him until his flight back to California. To this day, Sam is the first person we would\ncall if we needed an angel of mercy in a pinch.\nFor the first year of FTX's existence, Sam famously manned the customer service lines\nwhenever he had a few minutes to spare, in part to make sure he knew about customer-related\nproblems first-hand but also because he likes solving others' problems. He made a deliberate\nchoice to be open with other FTX employees about his own struggles with depression both to\ndestigmatize it and, by his own example, encourage them to seek help if they needed it. In late\n3\nEx. A-14 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 407-15 Filed 02/27/24 Page 4 of 6\n2021, he asked George Lerner to join FTX as a coach to make mental health counseling available\nfor free and in confidence to any employees who wanted it. It turned out many of them did. As\nthe demands on him as CEO of a $30 billion company piled up, he was much less available to\nindividual employees. I'm guessing that did not help internal communications when serious\nproblems arose in mid-2022.\nPrison has afforded Sam few opportunities to do good in the world. But in the six months he\nhas been at MDC, he has run a tutoring session to prep fellow inmates for their GED exams, and\nhas helped two inmates who are facing close to a lifetime in prison for crimes they likely did not\ncommit to find competent counsel prepared their case. Half of my conversations with Sam are\ntaken up discussing their cases. He has put in hours and hours helping them organize the\nrelevant facts, research the relevant law, and write up summaries of the case for their (newly\nhired) lawyers. The mother of one of the inmates reached out to me about three months ago to\nask me to pass along her gratitude to Sam, who-- she said-- has given her son a reason to live\nfor the first time since his arrest four years ago. (Her son's case is a compelling one, and raises\nissues that may well end up being decided by the Supreme Court. In the end, Sam's\nintervention may well save a life.)\nI want to raise one other concern as a mother that bears directly on the appropriate form of\npunishment here. As was apparent to anyone following his meteoric rise, his behavior in the\nyear following the implosion of FTX, and in the trial itself self-presentation can seem odd and\noffputting to many who don't know him. He has a number of mannerisms that are associated\nwith high-functioning people with ASD: he is bad at responding to social cues in 'normal' ways,\nuncomfortable looking people in the eye, uncomfortable with outward shows of emotion. He\nhas no interest in small talk but will engage passionately and relentlessly with ideas to the point\nthat can exasperate and exhaust others. I know, having disappointed him many times in our\nconversations over the years by running out of intellectual energy long before he showed any\nsigns of flagging. Some of these traits (his proclivity to think through problems and possibilities\nexhaustively for himself and his tirelessness in pursuit of solutions) are great strengths and\nwere essential to his success. Others have generally not been problematic in the social worlds\nhe gravitated to or built at MIT, math camp, and, to some extent, FTX. He lived in the geekiest\ndorm at MIT. I remember one memorable meal I had with his dormmates when I went to visit\nhim. The velocity with which ideas were flying around the table left me barely able to follow the\ntopic of the conversation, let alone contribute to it. It was clear to me that he was finally in his\nelement.\nThe broader public was charmed by many of his eccentricities- or at least pretended to be--\nwhile he was on top of the world. The moment he fell, the same public became merciless,\nridiculing his awkward traits and verbal style, taking them as a sign of duplicity or worse, and\nportraying him as a freak with evil intentions. The media's weapon of choice is words. The same\ncannot be said of prisons. I genuinely fear for Sam's life in the typical prison environment. Sam's\noutward presentation, his inability to read or respond appropriately to many social cues, and\nhis touching but naive belief in the power of facts and reason to resolve disputes, put him in\nextreme danger. It may be that some of the inmates will come to appreciate Sam once they get\n4\nEx. A-14 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 407-15 Filed 02/27/24 Page 5 of 6\nto know him. But miscommunication in that environment is dangerous, and Sam's traits greatly\nelevate the likelihood of its occurring. Putting him in solitary confinement to protect him from\nothers is no solution. It is just a more certain form of murder, and in many ways a crueler one,\nslowly destroying his soul rather than his body.\nAs you decide the appropriate punishment for Sam, I hope you will consider a few additional\nthings.\nSam lived an exemplary life in every way prior to the events that brought FTX down, not merely\navoiding doing bad things, but dedicating his life to doing good. He took responsibility from the\nfirst day for the errors that led to FTX's implosion and the losses that resulted. As he said to the\nworld, he was CEO and the buck stopped with him. (A number of people remarked at the time\non twitter that that was the first time they had heard a CEO say that.)\nEvery day of his life since November 8th he has been wracked with remorse for not having\nprevented the implosion of FTX and the damage that followed. It is, he has told me, the first\nthing he thinks about when he wakes up and the last thing he thinks about when he goes to\nsleep, and it occupies many moments in between. For the first month after the implosion, he\ncould have left the Bahamas and abandoned the company, as almost everyone else including\nhis three cofounders did within days. Instead, he stayed put and worked tirelessly to save the\ncompany as a going concern to maximize the chance that all stakeholders could be made\nwhole. He had no expectation that he would profit in any way from his efforts; that was never\nhis motivation. He offered balance sheets and spreadsheets identifying all of FTX's assets to\nboth the Bahamian and US bankruptcy officials, and offered to connect them with potential\ninvestors who continued to reach out to him to express interest in investing long after he ceded\ncontrol of the company. The US bankruptcy team cut him off on day 1. He nonetheless\npersevered. When John Ray lamented publicly that the internal records of FTX were so bad\nthey could not put together a list of customers, Sam located the relevant documents\nimmediately and wrote to the Ch 11 team offering to show them how to access the preexisting\nlist. They never answered his emails.\nBy the end of December, the US bankruptcy team had made no progress towards making\ncreditors whole, having spent almost all of their time, by their own acknowledgement,\nprosecuting Sam and his cofounders. In contrast, the Bahamian authorities, who accepted\nSam's help, in the same time made significant progress towards rebooting and recapitalizing\nthe international exchange. Their efforts could well have succeeded in making FTX's\ninternational customers whole in a matter of week if the US bankruptcy team had not\nintervened to shut them down.\nIn the two months following the implosion, Sam repeatedly reached out to Ray to confirm that\nthe Ch. 11 team was using the right financial data in putting together their own balance sheets,\nand offering to vet them. Ray never responded. When Ray announced in January that the Ch.\n11 team's analysis showed that FTX US was insolvent at the time it was put into bankruptcy,\n5\nEx. A-14 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 407-15 Filed 02/27/24 Page 6 of 6\nSam identified the error publicly, referencing the balance sheets that Ray's team themselves\nhad prepared.\nSam continued his efforts on behalf of customers literally until the moment he was arrested on\nDecember 12th and put in a Bahamian prison. I know. I was there. After he was denied bail and\nspent twelve days in the Bahamian prison, he agreed to voluntary extradition to the US solely\nbecause he concluded he could be of no use in the effort to reboot the exchange in order to\nmake customers whole while locked up in a Bahamian prison, unable to communicate with the\noutside world. He thought, naively, that once back in the US, he would have months before his\ntrial to help right the damage, and continued to try through March at a high cost to himself.\nOnly thirty-two years old and with his whole future in front of him, Sam now faces the prospect\nof spending much of the rest of his life in prison. His father and I face the very real possibility\nthat we will not live long enough to see him freed. There are no words for the grief we feel.\nHaving been blessed myself with a relatively long life filled with purpose, work I care about, and\ngood friends and family surrounding me, I would gladly change places with him if I could.\nI have taught at San Quentin, visited Sam in a Bahamian prison that is widely regarded as one of\nthe worst in the world, and, since Aug. 11th, spent countless hours at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center where Sam is housed, a soul-crushing institution currently facing multiple\nsuits for violations of prisoners' constitutional rights. I have also taught and written about the\nUS criminal justice system, the punitive nature of which makes us an extreme outlier among all\ndemocracies. I have no illusions about the redemptive power of prisons. Being consigned to\nprison for decades will destroy Sam as surely as would hanging him, because it will take away\neverything in the world that gives his life meaning.\nBut this is not just a personal tragedy. The ease with which we consign young lives with so\nmuch promise to the trash heap is a societal tragedy as well. To what end? The financial losses\ncustomers and other creditors were facing, it is now clear, will be compensated in full. No one\nwho knows Sam could seriously think he poses a threat of recidivism. If allowed to resume his\nlife, he would do the only thing he has ever cared about: devote the remainder of his natural\nlife to leaving the world a better place than he found it. With his talents and single-minded\ncommitment to doing good in this world, there is a real chance that he would succeed, even\naccounting for the harm done by the implosion of FTX.\nI hope for his sake and the sake of the world that he is given that chance.\nRon H\n10\nEx.

    "news_content": "Advertisement A PDF version of this document with embedded text is available at the link below: Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 407-3 Filed 02/27/24\r\nHon. Lewis A. Kaplan\r\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse\r\n500 Pearl Street\r\nNew York, NY 1007-1312\r\nDear Judge Kaplan:\r\nPage 1 of 4\r\nThank you for the opportunity to allow me to say a few words about my son, Sam Bankman-\r\nFried, that I believe bear on a just sentence in this case.\r\nAs a child, Sam had impressive powers of logic and perseverance, and was by nature an outside-\r\nthe-box thinker. But he also had some challenges many of which are associated with some of\r\nthose same strengths. I will return to them at the end. But first, I would like to talk about the\r\nwhole person-- the Sam I have watched grow up, slowly find himself, and decide how he wanted\r\nto live his life.\r\nFrom an early age, he loved math and complicated games and wanted to talk about the world. He\r\nwas uncomfortable around other children and childhood play, and as a result was a loner in many\r\npeer social settings until he got to college. By the time he was ten or so, he had no interest in\r\nmaterial goods. We would ask him what he wanted for his birthday or Chanukah, and he would\r\nsay \"nothing.\" We ended up agreeing that we wouldn't keep asking him about it, but that he\r\nshould tell us if he had changed his mind and wanted anything. He never did.\r\nHe was, however, always interested in the material conditions of other peoples' lives, in\r\nparticular those around the world most desperately in need. He took a job on Wall Street to earn\r\nto give, and ultimately left Wall Street to work full-time for one of the charities he had helped\r\nfund. He worried, though, that without his annual donations, the charity would have trouble\r\nmaking ends meet. He started trading cryptocurrency on the side to help support the charity. As it\r\nhappened, he was so successful trading that he again decided that his highest and best use was\r\nnot working directly for the charity but instead as a funder, and decided to go into business for\r\nhimself. This was a path I never imagined he would take.\r\nAs I discuss more below, while running FTX, Sam's primary focus was business; he worked day\r\nand night. But he continued to work on charity, both as a funder and as an active participant in\r\ndecision-making. Sam organized, participated in, and ultimately funded a group that is carrying\r\nout groundbreaking vaccine trials that may change the face of pandemic prevention and the\r\nprevention and treatment of other infectious diseases around the world\r\nIn 2022, 1 took a year's leave of absence from my Stanford job to work on other philanthropic\r\nprojects worthy of funding by FTX. My own work focused on education and health care, arcas\r\nin which I have both experience and a strong professional interest. I loved this work, and could\r\ngo on and on about the promising philanthropic projects underway at the time of FTX's\r\nimplosion, but I am mindful of the court's time in reading this document.\r\n1\r\nEx. A-2 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 407-3 Filed 02/27/24\r\nPage 2 of 4\r\nSam also supported efforts to realize the potential of a digital infrastructure for money transfers\r\nto people in the poorest parts of the world. One project involved remittances - cross-border\r\ntransfers of money, generally from children in a wealthy country to parents in a poorer country.\r\nThe recipients do not have bank accounts to transfer funds into. Right now, the sender typically\r\ngoes to a company such as Western Union, pays for the remittance there, and parents pick up the\r\nmoney from a Western Union office in their own country. The process is expensive and time\r\nconsuming. Using its cryptocurrency infrastructure, FIX estimated it could offer free,\r\ninstantaneous transfers, receivable in local currency, at a minimal cost to itself. A beta version of\r\nthis program - offering free remittances between the US and 28 countries in Africa --was about\r\nto begin at the time of the bankruptcy. I was lucky enough to be able to work on this project and\r\nwould have regarded its implementation as the most socially valuable thing I had done with my\r\nlife.\r\nAlthough Sam started FTX as a way to earn to give, he never saw the business solely as a means\r\nto an end to fund good works. For the entirety of FTX's existence, his time was pretty much\r\nconsumed with building the company, which included creating a social environment that fostered\r\ncreativity and met the needs of employees. Subject to the increasing demands on his time as a\r\nCEO of a rapidly growing business, he tried always to be there for his employees. The company\r\nwas housed in an office park-like complex, with a number of connected or adjoining buildings.\r\nSam worked in the busiest building, on a desk next to dozens of other desks. He had no office\r\nand no other personal perks. It was a bare-bones place, much less attractive than the typical\r\nworkplaces in law firms, government offices or universities, and most businesses, but it was in\r\nkeeping with Sam's commitment to egalitarianism and facilitated goals that were a high priority\r\nto Sam.\r\nThe office layout was also designed to give any employee access to Sam. Sam was a great\r\nlistener and treated employees like family. He wasn't good at small talk and was likely to look\r\ndown or away when he spoke to them, but employees knew he wasn't dissing them. That's just\r\nthe way he was. He paid employees what he thought was their rightful contribution to profits,\r\nwhich was almost always far above what they could have earned elsewhere and in many cases\r\nwould have asked for themselves, and when they came to him with personal problems, his first\r\nand usually last impulse was to give them what they needed without asking any questions.\r\nHe treated other stakeholders in the business with similar respect. He did customer service\r\nhimself, and gave employees instructions to resolve any plausible complaints in the customer's\r\nfavor even if it cost the company a nontrivial amount of money. He also believed in fair dealing\r\nin negotiations with others. He would generally decide what a fair price was, explain why he\r\nthought it was fair, and stick to it. He'd instruct his lawyers not to press minor issues in reaching\r\nagreements with counterparties.\r\nThe company owned the top floor of an apartment complex near the office. It housed eight or so\r\nof the top employees and their partners, and served both as an informal headquarters of sorts, a\r\nplace to entertain prospective business partners, and a gathering place for employees to relax, cat\r\ndinner together (usually cooked by Sam) and play complicated board games, the diversion of\r\nchoice. It was festooned with computer screens and desks, and for one week the entire\r\n2\r\nEx. A-2 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 407-3 Filed 02/27/24\r\nPage 3 of 4\r\nprogramming staff used it for a Hackathon. Sam lived in it and - paid rent for that privilege - for\r\nsix months-about half of the time he was in the Bahamas. Even when he was officially living in\r\nthe apartment, he was more likely to be found elsewhere - often sleeping on a bean bag chair in\r\nthe office. Like everything about Sam, that wasn't an affectation. He just doesn't care about the\r\ncreature comforts that most of us value. He is similarly uninterested in hobnobbing with the rich\r\nand famous and generally uncomfortable with attention. He did what he thought he had to do for\r\nthe good of the company, often at some significant personal cost to himself. What FTX spent on\r\nadvertising, travel, and housing is in line with what comparable multibillion dollar companies\r\nspend, and a small fraction of what many do spend. For anyone who knows Sam, the popular\r\nportrayal of him as a high-rolling, celebrity-secking, CEO driven by greed is simply bizarre.\r\nI am the son of a small businessman and told Sam what I believe my father would have told him:\r\ntake some money out for yourself and put it somewhere safe. Or buy something special, so you\r\ncan enjoy life more. Others, including senior counsel, told Sam the same thing. According to\r\none business journal, by 2022, Sam had a net worth of more than $20 billion. He could easily\r\nhave sold a billion dollars' worth of stock. He wouldn't do that, though. He wanted to leave\r\nevery penny in the business to finance its growth. He had a salary of $200,000, which was more\r\nthan enough for his personal consumption needs. He had nothing \"salted away\" when the crash\r\ncame.\r\nBarbara and I stayed with Sam in the Bahamas for the month following the collapse, and\r\nwitnessed firsthand his single-minded focus on getting money back to depositors, long after there\r\nwas any possibility he would be able to save any of his equity or wealth. About a week after the\r\nimplosion, Sam and I were speaking to a prospective defense counsel. The lawyer was aghast\r\nwhen Sam told him that he was spending all of his time working with the Bahamian government\r\nto get depositors their money back. The lawyer strongly advised Sam to focus on his defense.\r\n\"Are you aware,\" asked the lawyer, \"that even as we speak, there is probably a room of bright,\r\nhard-working and ambitious people somewhere whose goal is to put you in jail?”\r\n\"Yup,\" answered Sam, \"and that's pretty much irrelevant to me compared to helping depositors.\"\r\nI recognize that the Sam I have described is strongly at odds with how the public sees him, and\r\nmay seem unbelievable to the readers of this letter, including this court. I could add hundreds of\r\nother examples of his kindness and genuine and deep concern for others, but I'm not sure how\r\nmuch difference they would make, and doing so would surely try the patience of readers. I will\r\nadd only that were the social costs of saying anything positive about Sam at this moment in time\r\nnot prohibitive, I am confident many others who have known him throughout his life would\r\ndescribe much the same person.\r\nI want now to return to the challenges I referred to at the start, and their implications for\r\nsentencing. Sam has struggled throughout his life to learn and control things most of us take for\r\ngranted, such as eye contact, small talk, and responding to social cues.\r\nThere is a positive side to this struggle. Sam's life experience has made him tolerant of\r\ndiversity in the way most of us cannot be. Sam hired employees with communication\r\ndifficulties so great that they could not otherwise get or keep another job. I remember him\r\n3\r\nEx. A-2 Case 1:22-cr-00673-LAK Document 407-3 Filed 02/27/24\r\nPage 4 of 4\r\ntelling me about one trader who fit that description. \"He's brilliant, but he'll drive everybody\r\nclsc nuts,\" Sam said, “so he'll work only with me.\" As Barbara has written, Sam was open about\r\nsome of his own mental health struggles, and hired a psychiatrist to help coach employees with\r\nemotional issues. Alameda and FTX had a diverse group of employees -- in gender, race,\r\nnationality and character traits. The companies employed some of the most extroverted people I\r\nhave ever known. But they were also a haven for those with who, for reasons having nothing to\r\ndo with their abilities, would be deemed too odd or \"weird\" to work with.\r\nAs the company grew, Sam was thrust more and more into the public eye, and asked to give\r\nhundreds of interviews a month. When he agreed to do them, characteristically, he spoke very\r\nquickly, and gave long complicated answers when he thought that was what logic required, and\r\nanswers that were jarringly short (a quick sharp 'yup') otherwise. He couldn't always manage\r\nhis gestures, eye contact or tone of voice. The press didn't care, though, as long as he talked\r\nabout business. He was extremely wealthy, and that made everything he said presumptively\r\ncorrect. Often, interviewers edited out his cominents about charity as uninteresting or\r\nunimportant.\r\nOnce the company crashed and his wealth was gone, people became less forgiving, and have\r\ninterpreted these same characteristics (lack of eye contact, odd gestures, answers that scem too\r\nlong or too short, etc) as a sign of disrespect, evasion, or lying.\r\nA draconian sentence would likely lead to a placement in a high (or at best medium) security\r\nprison. Such a setting would put Sam in an environment where his responses to social cues will\r\nsometimes be seen as odd, inappropriate and disrespectful; when that happens, he will be in\r\nsignificant physical danger. Nothing he has done can justify putting him at that risk.\r\nSam has never run afoul of the law in his life until now, and I do not believe there is any\r\npossibility he would even get close to the line in the future. Once free, he has the potential to\r\nbenefit others. That is all he has ever wanted to do.\r\nThank you for your consideration, onside\r\nAllan Joseph Bankman\r\n4\r\nEx. A-2 Advertisement",

    "news_content": "The Times and Your Data The Times and Your Data Last revised on September 9, 2024 This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar tracking methods (such as pixels, SDKs, JavaScript, local storage, device identifiers, etc., which we refer to as “trackers”) when you visit our site. “Our site” means our websites, emails, apps and other services that link to this Cookie Policy, like nytimes.com and its subdomains, including The Athletic and Wirecutter. This policy explains what various tracking methods are, and why they are used. It also explains your right to control their use. We may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Check the “last revised” date at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any change becomes effective when we post the revised Cookie Policy on or through our site. Where we use trackers to collect information that is personally identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable if we combine it with other information, our Privacy Policy will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy. If you have any questions, please contact us by email at privacy@nytimes.com. You can also write to us: The New York Times Company, 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10018, attn.: Legal Department. If you have any questions regarding The Athletic, please contact The Athletic at privacy@theathletic.com. We use a variety of tracker methods; six of the main types are explained below.This list is intended to include all categories that we use, although the categories may vary depending on the use of our site. We use trackers to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the services through the internet, to analyze trends, and to learn about our user base so that we can improve our services and your experience. We may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through trackers with other personal information that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties in order to enhance our services, or to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you. Please reference the descriptions below to learn more about the kinds of trackers we use and for what purpose. A) Cookies A cookie is a small string of text that a website (or online service) stores on a user’s browser. It saves data on your browser about your visit to our site or other sites. It often includes a unique identifier (e.g., cookie #123). “First-party cookies” are cookies set by us (or on our behalf) on our site. “Third-party cookies” are cookies set by other companies whose functionality is embedded into our site (e.g., google.com). “Session cookies” are temporary cookies stored on your device while you visit our site. They expire when you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” are stored on your browser for a period of time after you leave our site. Persistent cookies expire on a set expiration date, or when they are deleted manually. We use persistent cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit. This allows us, for example, to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our services, how often you return, how your use of the services may vary over time, to target advertising, and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the services and customize your online experience. You can choose whether to accept cookies by editing your browser settings. However, if cookies are refused, your experience on our site may be worse, and some features may not work as intended. B)Pixels Pixels (also known as “web beacons,” “GIFs” or “bugs”) are one-pixel transparent images located on web pages or messages. They track whether you have opened these web pages or messages. Upon firing, a pixel logs a visit to the current page or message and may read or set cookies. Pixels often rely on cookies to work, so turning off cookies can impair them. But even if you turn off cookies, pixels can still detect a web page visit. C) Javascript JavaScript is a programming language. It can be used to write trackers that, when embedded into a page, allow us to measure how you interact with our site and other sites. D)Software Development Kits (or SDKs) SDKs are pieces of code provided by our digital vendors (e.g., third-party advertising companies, ad networks and analytics providers) in our mobile apps to collect and analyze certain device and user data. E)Device Identifiers Device identifiers are user-resettable identifiers comprised of numbers and letters. They are unique to a specific device. They are stored directly on the device. They are used to recognize you and/or your devices(s) on, off and across different apps and devices for marketing and advertising purposes. F)ID Synching In order to decide what type of ad might interest you, our digital and marketing vendors sometimes link data — inferred from your browsing of other sites or collected from other sources — using a method knowns as “ID synching” or “cookie synching.” To do this, they match the tracker ID they have assigned to you with one or more tracker IDs that are held in another company’s database and that are likely also associated with you. Any of the linked trackers may have certain interests and other demographic information attributed to it. That information is then used to determine which ad to show you. Below is a list of the types of trackers that appear on our site. Essential Trackers Essential trackers are required for our site to operate and to provide you with the features or services that you have requested. They allow you to navigate our site and use its services and features (e.g., cookies that help you stay logged in). Without essential trackers, our site will not run smoothly; in fact, our site (or certain services or features) might not even be available to you simply because of technical limitations. Analytics Trackers Analytics trackers collect or use information about your site use, which helps us improve our site. Among the uses of analytics trackers are to show us which pages are most frequently visited, help us record difficulties you have with our site, track subscription purchases and behaviors leading to subscription purchases, and measure how well ads perform. These trackers add up our readers’ visits to show us larger patterns in our audience. We look at these larger patterns to analyze site traffic. Marketing Trackers These trackers help us determine which ads to show you for Times properties — both on our site and on other sites. To do this, these trackers use information about your behavior on various sites to target our ads. These trackers allow us to limit the number of times you see our ad across your devices. They help us personalize the ads we show you. They also enable us to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns (e.g., measure if you subscribe after seeing our ads). Advertising Trackers Advertising trackers help us and our advertising partners to determine which ads from third parties are selected for you. Some of these trackers collect or use information about your behavior and browsing habits on our services and other sites (including the pages you have visited, and the links and advertisements you have clicked). They also collect your demographic details, interests and certain technical information about your browser or device to aid this targeting. These trackers sometimes limit the number of times you see an ad, make an ad more relevant to you or measure the effectiveness of an ad campaign. We may not have control or access to such trackers. If you look at one page on our services, an advertisement may be delivered to you on our services or on other sites, for products referenced on that page or for similar products and services. We work with advertisers, ad agencies and other vendors to serve these ads, who often use their own trackers through our site. The ads served can include additional trackers which are activated when an ad is visible to you or when you click on or otherwise interact with an ad. In certain jurisdictions, when you first come to our site, you will receive a banner notification that trackers are present. By clicking or tapping “accept all,” you agree to the use of these trackers as described here. You can manage your tracker settings at any time by clicking on “Manage Privacy Preferences” in our website footer or in your app “Privacy Settings”, or “Account Settings” for the Athletic app. In addition, you can refuse or accept trackers from our site (or any other site) in your browser’s settings. If you refuse trackers, you might not be able to sign in or use other tracker-dependent features of our site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but this is typically something you can adjust. Information for each browser can be found in the links below: Safari on desktopandSafari Mobile (iPhone and iPads): Note that, by default, Safari is engineered to protect you from being tracked from site to site unless you disable Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). Firefox: By default, Firefox protects you from cross-site tracking so long as you have not disabled Total Cookie Protection. There is therefore less need to manage cookies to protect your privacy. Chrome Microsoft Edge: Enabling tracking prevention with Edge will protect you from being tracked between sites, such that there will be less of a need to manage your cookies in order to protect your privacy. Samsung Internet Browser: By default, Samsung Internet Browser enables the “Smart anti-tracking“ function that will help block third parties attempting to track your personal information. Brave: By default, Brave protects you from cross-site tracking by blocking third-party cookies. For more information about other browsers, please refer to this“All About Cookies” guide. For more information about trackers, including information about how to manage and delete trackers, please visit theICO’s website. To opt out of Google Analytics data collection, followthese Google instructions. To reset your device identifier, followGoogle instructionsandApple instructions. The third-party advertisers, ad agencies and other vendors with which we work may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioural Advertising and/or the European Digital Advertising Alliance (eDAA). To opt out of interest-based advertising from the participating companies, please visitAboutAds.infoorthe European Digital Advertising Alliancefor laptops andNAI Mobile ChoicesorAppChoicesfor mobile devices. Note that opting out through these channels does not mean you will no longer see ads and is specific to the device and browser you are using. You will still receive other types of ads from these companies, and any type of ad from nonparticipating companies. The sites you visit may still collect your information for other purposes. Your browser may offer you a \"Do Not Track\" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Please note that The Athletic does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity while you are using The Athletic.
