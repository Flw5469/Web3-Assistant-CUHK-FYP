    "news_title": "\r\n\tThunes partners with Circle to support stablecoin transactions - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " This partnership is designed to support the liquidity and efficiency of stablecoin transactions within Thunesâ Direct Global Network, particularly in cross-border payments. The collaboration will allow Thunesâ network members to conduct cross-border transfers using USDC, providing faster, round-the-clock transactions. By settling transactions with USDC, Thunes aims to enhance liquidity while reducing the capital costs typically associated with cross-border payments.    According to Thunes, USDC as a regulated stablecoin, is increasingly used within the financial ecosystem to bridge traditional and digital currencies. Stablecoins such as USDC offer advantages in liquidity management by reducing transaction volatility and enabling near-instant settlement across global markets. Leveraging blockchain technology, these digital assets facilitate reliable, traceable transactions and are emerging as a significant financial tool for businesses and individuals alike. Thunesâ adoption of stablecoins aligns with its goal of optimising cross-border transactions, aiming to deliver faster and more cost-effective payment solutions across its global network. Thunes officials emphasised the role of stablecoins in enhancing Thunes' service and revealed their goal to maintain an accessible, safe, and efficient global network. In turn, representatives from Circle highlighted the broader implications of the partnership, noting that USDCâs role in cross-border transactions underscores the potential of digital currencies to support secure and transparent transactions globally. In an effort to further optimise cross-border payments,Thunes entered into a strategic agreement with MBANKto allow the latter to be part of the Thunes Direct Global Network. As part of this collaboration and by being a member of the Thunesâ network, MBANK gained the ability to connect businesses and individuals in Kyrgyzstan directly to over 7 billion mobile wallets and bank accounts globally. In essence, the partnership intended to facilitate simplified money movement to and from Kyrgyzstan, with the two firms planning to enable local licenced institutions and merchants to make a wide range of transactions, including B2B, P2P, B2C, and C2B payments. Through these services, Thunes and MBANK aimed to assist different cross-border use cases, such as foreign education payments, ecommerce transactions, and local acceptance of gig economy payments.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tTransak data breach affects over 92,000 users - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " The breach, which exposed Know Your Customer (KYC) data, underscores persistent cybersecurity challenges within the cryptocurrency sector. In a blog post from 21 October 2024, Transak shared that the breach was linked to a phishing attack on an employee's laptop. This vulnerability granted the attacker access to a third-party KYC vendorâs system used by Transak for identity verification processes. The compromised data includes usersâ personal information such as names, birth dates, passports, driverâs licences, and ID selfies, affecting 92,554 individuals, or roughly 1.14% of Transakâs user base. Transak clarified that no financial data was compromised in the breach. According to the company, no email addresses, phone numbers, passwords, credit card information, Social Security numbers, or other financial records were affected.    Classified as âmild to moderateâ in severity, the breach involved only basic identity verification details without more sensitive financial data. Transak officials confirmed this classification, noting that financial statements and Social Security numbers were not accessed, potentially minimising immediate risk to users. However, a ransomware group has claimed responsibility, asserting possession of over 300GB of sensitive data that includes government-issued IDs. The group also claimed that they would release or sell remaining data if Transak did not meet their ransom demands. They criticised Transakâs reported offer of USD 30,000 to delete the data, describing it as inadequate. According to Transak, the breach occurred because the affected employee engaged in non-work-related activities on their laptop. A malicious script infected the device, enabling access to the KYC system. The employee has since been dismissed. Despite the ransomware groupâs assertion that they obtained further sensitive documents, Transak has refused to negotiate. Company officials voiced doubts over the groupâs claims of additional data, asking for proof of any wider access. The breach highlights ongoing cybersecurity risks even among established players, reminding the industry of the need for robust security measures. Transakâs response to this breach will likely be observed closely by regulators and industry participants, emphasising a continued focus on strengthening security within the crypto ecosystem.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tMesh partners with Shift4 - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " With this development, Shift4âs merchants will have the option to accept cryptocurrency payments worldwide, becoming one of the first major payments companies to offer a simplified one-click crypto payment solution. The new feature leverages Meshâs secure API infrastructure, which enables crypto payments to be automatically converted into local currencies and settled, reducing operational complexity and minimising currency conversion risks for merchants. In the official press release, representatives from Shift4 commented on the initiative, stating that the team is enthusiastic about supporting wider crypto adoption. They noted that since acquiring The Giving Block in 2022 and establishing Shift4âs Crypto Innovation Centre, this integration has been a priority for Shift4âs strategy.    With a reported increase in interest for crypto payments, especially in stablecoins, many merchants are exploring digital currency options. A Deloitte survey recently highlighted that approximately 64% of merchants see considerable interest from their customers in using digital currencies for transactions. By integrating crypto payments, Shift4 aims to meet this growing demand, providing a reliable avenue for merchants to connect with the crypto economy. TAO Group and BLADE are among the first companies to implement this feature, as their customers have shown substantial interest in paying with crypto. Reflecting on the broader implications, officials from Mesh pointed out that Bitcoin was originally conceived as a form of peer-to-peer electronic cash, rather than solely an investment asset. According to them, the new features represent not only a step forward for the crypto industry but also a return to the foundational idea of decentralized digital payments. Mesh, backed by over USD 45 million from investors such as PayPal Ventures, Galaxy, and Revolut's QuantumLight, has positioned itself as an important player in the crypto space. The companyâs platform includes integrations with Coinbase, MetaMask, and MoonPay. Every day we send out a free e-mail with the most important headlines of the last 24 hours.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tBitstamp receives MiFID Multilateral Trading Facility licence - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " The licence was granted by the Securities Market Agency in Slovenia to Bitstamp Financial Services, the exchangeâs subsidiary. This MTF licence allows Bitstamp to provide crypto derivatives products, including perpetual swaps, to both institutional and retail clients. These offerings complement Bitstamp's existing spot exchange services and may provide investors with opportunities for increased capital efficiency and indirect exposure to cryptocurrency.    The MiFID regulation (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) oversees traditional financial markets in the European Union. It establishes a regulatory framework that applies to various financial products, including stocks, securities, and derivatives, as well as to financial institutions such as trading platforms, investment managers, and banks. Bitstampâs recent licence classifies it among the few cryptocurrency exchanges authorised under this directive, allowing it to facilitate EU-regulated crypto derivatives trading. The MTF licence recognises Bitstamp's adherence to strict regulatory standards, including capital requirements, corporate governance, and client protection measures. Additionally, the licence reflects the robustness of Bitstampâs internal controls for security, anti-money laundering protocols, and regulatory compliance. Bitstamp officials commented on the achievement, noting that being granted the MiFID MTF licence highlights the exchangeâs commitment to safety, security, and regulatory standards. They added that the licence will enable Bitstamp to introduce derivatives products, creating an environment that supports a range of investment strategies and potentially enhancing capital efficiency for institutional investors. With this licence, Bitstamp is looking to solidify its position within the evolving cryptocurrency landscape as one of the few regulated exchanges capable of offering a broader array of financial instruments. As part of its efforts to comply with regulatory standards, in June 2024Bitstamp made changes to its platformto adapt to MiCA. At the time, officials from Bitstamp revealed that they welcome the implementation of MiCA, which will standardise the regulation of cryptocurrencies across the European Union.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tFTX settles lawsuit with Bybit and Mirana - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": "Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchangeFTXhas reached a settlement to withdraw its lawsuit against Bybit, its executives, and the investment firm Mirana.  The move will enable the the failed cryptocurrency exchange to recover approximately USD 228 million, funds that will be used to repay creditors in the upcoming months. In a court filing submitted recently, FTX officials detailed their efforts to engage in lengthy, good faith negotiations and ultimately reach a global settlement. The terms of the settlement will permit FTXâs liquidation estate to retrieve USD 175 million in cryptocurrencies stored in Bybit accounts. Additionally, FTX plans to sell over 105 million BIT tokens held by Mirana, which are valued at roughly USD 52.7 million according to theblock.co. Furthermore, defendants who transferred their funds out of FTX prior to its bankruptcy will retain the right to recover 75% of the total balance in their accounts as of the date of the bankruptcy petition. The lawsuit was initiated by FTX in November of last year, accusing Bybit of using its VIP access to withdraw substantial amounts in cash and digital assets shortly before FTXâs collapse in 2022. FTX also alleged that Bybit hindered the estateâs attempts to withdraw assets from its trading platform, effectively holding those assets âhostage.â    Recently, FTX, under the leadership of bankruptcy expert John J. Ray III, reported that more than 94% of its creditors haveapproved its reorganisation plan. The approval was granted by US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey during a hearing in Wilmington, Delaware. Dorsey described the case as a benchmark for handling a complex Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The approved plan includes several settlements with various stakeholders, including FTX creditors, customers, US government agencies, and liquidators managing the companyâs non-US operations. Under these settlements, FTX will prioritise repaying its customers from the recovered assets, before addressing claims from regulators.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tNigeria drops case against Binance executive - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " Gambaryan, a US citizen, was detained during a business visit to Nigeria in February and later charged, along with Binance, in connection with the alleged laundering of USD 35.4 million. Both Gambaryan and Binance have denied these accusations. Gambaryan, who oversees financial crime compliance at Binance, the worldâs largest cryptocurrency exchange, was implicated by Nigerian authorities, who allege that the platformâs activities, including currency exchange rate manipulation and speculation, have contributed to recent economic challenges in Nigeria. The EFCC has accused Binance of currency manipulation and tax evasion, claiming that the platform's actions have influenced the depreciation of Nigeria's currency, the naira.    Concerns over Gambaryanâs health were highlighted by his family, who reported that his ongoing detention at the Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja had worsened an existing back issue. In August, his wife mentioned a herniated disk, which could cause permanent damage and impact his mobility. Despite these health concerns, the High Court denied him bail, citing flight risk due to the recent escape of another Binance executive. Binanceâs Africa regional manager was also detained with Gambaryan in February. He reportedly fled Nigeria shortly after being placed under house arrest, and authorities are continuing efforts to locate him. Gambaryan could not attend his court hearing last Friday due to illness, leading the EFCC to announce the case withdrawal on Wednesday. Afterwards, EFCC officials revealed that the charges were dropped to allow Gambaryan to seek medical treatment abroad. While the charges against Gambaryan have been dropped, the tax evasion case against Binance, filed by Nigeriaâs Federal Inland Revenue Service, remains active. Binance has also faced legal action in the United States, where its founder Changpeng Zhao stepped down last year and later received a four-month prison sentence over allegations related to money laundering activities facilitated on the platform.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tUK leads European crypto economy with USD 217 billion on-chain - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " The UK moved up two spots to twelfth in the Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index, recording USD 217 billion in on-chain crypto value from July 2023 to June 2024. In CNWE, merchant services represent a growing segment, driven primarily by the UK, where this sector expanded by 58.4% year-over-year. This region has the second-largest market for crypto merchant services globally, trailing only Central and Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO). Stablecoins lead as the most frequently used asset type, making up 60-80% of the market share each quarter.  Overall, CNWE is the second-largest cryptocurrency economy worldwide, following North America, and it recorded USD 987.25 billion in on-chain crypto transactions between July 2023 and June 2024, equating to 21.7% of the global volume. Key contributors include the UK, Germany (USD 125.3 billion), France (USD 101.2 billion), and the Netherlands (USD 83.3 billion). Year-over-year, crypto activity in the region saw a growth average of 44%. Stablecoins also dominate CNWEâs market share, with the regionâs stablecoin inflows for transactions under USD 1 million growing at a rate 2.5 times higher than in North America. Between July 2022 and June 2024, stablecoin transactions averaged 52.36% of the total across asset types. While May and June 2024 saw a decline in crypto inflows, stablecoin usage remained strong. Upcoming regulations, such as the EUâs Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) for stablecoins, are expected to further shape the market. In Eastern Europe, institutional and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity has significantly contributed to regional growth, making it the fourth-largest crypto economy globally, with USD 499.14 billion in on-chain value received over the past year. Centralized exchanges (CEXes) accounted for nearly USD 324 billion, while DeFi saw notable increases with USD 165.46 billion in crypto inflows. Regional leaders Ukraine and Russia ranked sixth and seventh globally in crypto adoption, with Russia advancing six places from the previous year.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tRobinhood introduces margin investing for UK users after FCA approval - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " The US-based investment platform stated that users would be able to leverage their existing assets as collateral to purchase additional securities. This rollout follows approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) after discussions between Robinhood and the UK financial regulator. Margin trading, less common in the UK due to the associated risks, is typically limited to high-net-worth individuals or institutional investors. Other platforms that offer similar services in the UK include Interactive Brokers, IG, and CMC Markets.  The introduction of margin trading comes shortly after Robinhood launched a securities lending product in the UK in September, which allows users to earn passive income from stocks they own. The platform is offering margin loans with interest rates ranging from 6.25% for loans up to USD 50,000 to 5.2% for loans exceeding USD 50 million. This is part of Robinhoodâs broader strategy to increase its market presence internationally. Associated risks While margin trading offers the potential for increased returns, it also carries significant risks, especially for retail investors. Leveraging borrowed funds to trade magnifies both gains and losses, with potential for significant financial exposure if the value of assets declines. Robinhood has implemented measures to mitigate these risks, requiring users to deposit a minimum of USD 2,000 in their accounts to access margin trading. Customers also need to opt-in to the service and meet specific eligibility criteria. Every day we send out a free e-mail with the most important headlines of the last 24 hours.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tStripe acquires stablecoin startup Bridge - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " The acquisition was confirmed by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, though both companies have yet to issue an official announcement at the time of writing. At USD 1.1 billion, this acquisition is the largest recorded deal within the cryptocurrency sector. It surpasses other significant transactions, such as CoinShares' USD 530 million acquisition of Valkyrie Funds and Robinhoodâs USD 200 million purchase of Bitstamp. Confirmation of the deal came shortly after Bloomberg reported that Stripe and Bridge were in advanced negotiations.We also reported on thisand highlighted the possibility that either party could withdraw from the deal. This uncertainty was settled when TechCrunchâs founder confirmed the final agreement. Bridge provides businesses with the ability to accept stablecoin payments from over 70 countries. The startup had raised USD 40 million in its Series A funding round, raising a total of USD 58 million in funding. Its investors include prominent venture capital firms such as Sequoia, Ribbit Capital, Index, and Haun Ventures.    Earlier this year, Stripe officials announced the company's return to stablecoin services. They noted that transactions involving stablecoins through Stripe would settle on-chain instantly and automatically convert to fiat currency. In June 2024,Stripe partnered with Coinbaseto enable fiat-to-crypto onramps and offramps for users of both platforms. This collaboration aimed to provide faster settlements and lower transaction fees for customers in over 150 countries, using stablecoins. In October 2024, Stripe expanded its cryptocurrency offerings by integrating Circle's US Dollar stablecoin (USDC) into its main payments interface. The integration saw immediate interest, with users from more than 70 countries conducting stablecoin transactions on the first day. This reflected the growing demand for tokenised fiat currencies, especially in cross-border payments where fees and long settlement times have historically been a challenge. While it remains unclear whether Bridge will continue to operate independently or be integrated into Stripe's platform, the acquisition signals Stripe's intent to enhance its role in the stablecoin ecosystem. According to financemagnates.com, other fintech companies such as Revolut and Robinhood are also exploring stablecoins, reflecting the rising interest in this segment, especially following the European Unionâs implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).

    "news_title": "\r\n\tChainlink unveils a new privacy feature for blockchains - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " This new capability allows financial institutions to ensure data confidentiality, data integrity, and regulatory compliance when conducting transactions across blockchain networks. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) will be one of the first institutions to trial the technology for cross-chain settlement of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) as part of the Monetary Authority of Singaporeâs (MAS) Project Guardian initiative. According to the official press release, historically, the lack of secure cross-chain privacy solutions has prevented financial institutions from fully engaging with blockchain systems in a way that meets stringent regulatory standards, including GDPR and MiFID II. These regulations often demand full end-to-end privacy for transactions between private blockchains, while also limiting data exposure when interacting with public blockchains. Chainlink has developed CCIP Private Transactions, which is powered by its Blockchain Privacy Manager, to address these issues. The Blockchain Privacy Manager enables institutions to securely connect private chains to both public and private blockchains using the public Chainlink CCIP network. It also facilitates the integration of traditional finance (TradFi) systems and enterprise infrastructure with private blockchains via the Chainlink Platform. Importantly, this process allows institutions to control which onchain information is disclosed, providing a solution to a significant privacy challenge within the blockchain sector. The privacy feature incorporates an encryption and decryption protocol that supports cross-chain transactions while keeping transaction details, including data, token amounts, and counterparties, confidential. This capability allows institutional users to define privacy parameters, ensuring that sensitive transaction data is kept hidden from unauthorized third parties, while still permitting access to compliance authorities when required.    In the company press release, representatives from Chainlinkâs explained that institutional privacy has been a major barrier to blockchain adoption. They noted that the lack of adequate privacy solutions has restricted institutional growth within the sector, but with the introduction of private cross-chain transactions, the industry could see broader adoption. Officials from ANZ highlighted the potential impact of Chainlinkâs privacy capabilities, stating that they could improve institutional blockchain use by ensuring privacy between blockchain networks. They also also expressed enthusiasm for the pilot project and its potential to resolve long-standing privacy concerns. Previously, ANZ and Chainlink had demonstrated the cross-chain settlement of tokenized assets, showcasing how financial institutions can use Chainlinkâs CCIP to enable trading and settlement of tokenized assets across public blockchains.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tSCB offers stablecoin solution for cross-border payments - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " The initiative was carried out in collaboration with SCB 10X, the bankâs venture and innovation arm, and Singapore-based fintech firm Lightnet. Fireblocks, a digital asset custody provider, is responsible for the custody technology. At the time of writing, no response was received regarding the specific blockchain or stablecoins used in the project. Typically, cross-border payments require banks to maintain pre-funded Nostro accounts in the recipient's country. According to ledgerinsights.com, the use of stablecoins could potentially eliminate this requirement, as stablecoin transactions are cost-effective and can be conducted around the clock. SCB officials noted that the bank aims to improve the efficiency, reliability, and accessibility of cross-border remittances through the use of blockchain technology and stablecoins.    While the solution initially targets individual consumers, SCB has plans to extend the offering to corporate clients. Meanwhile, in Japan, the countryâs three largest banks are also exploring similar cross-border payment systems, although they do not disclose the use of stablecoins. Instead, clients process payments through traditional banking channels. Additionally, SCB Tech X participated in a stablecoin trial using Hederaâs distributed ledger technology (DLT). The trial included banks from Korea, Taiwan, and South Africa. In July 2024,Siam Commercial Bank partnered with Sunlinewith the aim to revamp IT architecture for SCB's core banking system modernisation. The partnership also aimed to deliver better financial transaction processing performance for deposits and loans with enhanced efficiency, stability, security, and scalability to cater to an ever-increasing number of transactions. Furthermore, the partnership allowed SCB to offer customised financial solutions to individual customers and corporate clients. The development of the new core banking system was expected to take four years, moving towards SCB leadership as a full-fledged digital banking entity.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tAfrican fintech Yellow Card secures USD 33 mln in funding  - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": "This funding highlights the role of cryptocurrencies in transforming finance in emerging markets and facilitating capital movement in regions with underdeveloped banking systems.  Despite its growth, Yellow Card faces challenges as four North African countries have banned cryptocurrencies, and several Sub-Saharan nations have issued warnings about their use. Notably, Nigeria recently took steps to seize funds in cryptocurrency wallets to disrupt financial support for protest movements. Operating in 20 African countries, Yellow Card provides a payment platform that enables users to transfer money across borders at significantly lower fees compared to traditional money transfer services. The new funding will help the company expand its customer base and enter additional markets, including Ethiopia, Egypt, and Morocco, which is considering new regulations to further embrace digital currencies. Founded in 2016, Yellow Card employs stablecoins, typically pegged to the US dollar, as a standard medium of exchange to facilitate transactions. Customers depositing local currency receive stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, allowing them to conduct international transfers in various currencies through the Yellow Card platform. As many African currencies experience instability or depreciation against the US dollar, Yellow Card has developed a system to trade in local currencies with minimised risk, effectively positioning itself as a market maker for African currency transactions. The startup has dedicated years to building a substantial customer base, enabling it to balance deposits and withdrawals while carefully managing its treasury. The competitive advantage Yellow Card has established in its operational regions has led to partnerships with prominent crypto firms, including Coinbase and Block, which have chosen to utilize Yellow Cardâs financial infrastructure rather than compete directly. The African fintech landscape has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a surge in digital financial services and a notable increase in the adoption of cryptocurrencies among both consumers and businesses. With a rapidly expanding internet infrastructure and a young, tech-savvy population, the continent has become an attractive market for fintech innovations. Services such as mobile payments, digital wallets, and peer-to-peer lending have gained traction, enabling users to access financial tools previously unavailable due to underdeveloped banking systems. Additionally, cryptocurrencies are being embraced as alternative means of payment and investment, providing solutions for remittances and cross-border transactions at lower costs. Africa has emerged as a hotspot for fintech innovation, largely due to its high mobile penetration rates and the pressing need for financial inclusion. Many individuals and businesses in the region remain unbanked or underbanked, creating a fertile ground for digital solutions that offer accessible financial services. Mobile technology has facilitated the leapfrogging of traditional banking infrastructure, allowing fintech companies to reach underserved populations.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tMoonPay adds Venmo as payment option for US users - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " In essence, this update allows Venmoâs 60 million active users to conduct transactions on the MoonPay platform using their Venmo balance, or through bank accounts, credit cards, and debit cards linked to Venmo. The integration is intended to provide a wider range of options for MoonPay customers by offering them the familiarity and ease of using Venmo for payments. This development follows a recent integration between PayPal and MoonPay, which also enabled users to fund their accounts via PayPal. The new Venmo option is gradually becoming available to MoonPayâs US-based users and partners, except in New York and Texas, where it will not be offered.    In September 2024,Bitcoin.com announced a partnership with MoonPayto power the process of buying and selling crypto for its multiple global wallets. Following the announcement, MoonPay became the only payment provider that facilitated the process of buying and selling Bitcoin and other crypto on Bitcoin.comâs website and in its Mobile Wallet application. The collaboration leveraged Bitcoin.comâs relationship with MoonPay, while also allowing users to buy and sell crypto around the globe using all major payment methods. This includes credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and bank transfers via MoonPay. In addition, both financial institutions were expected to continue to focus on meeting the needs, preferences, and demands of clients and customers in an ever-evolving market, while prioritising the process of remaining compliant with the regulatory requirements and laws of the industry as well. In July 2024,MoonPay entered into a partnership with Meshto streamline the process of depositing and transferring cryptocurrency from exchanges. This collaboration allowed users to purchase cryptocurrency using fiat currency and existing crypto from centralised exchanges such as Coinbase. The partnership aimed to facilitate easier entry points into cryptocurrency for users and enhance access to liquidity. MoonPay provides a variety of payment options, including debit and credit cards, bank transfers, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and specialised local payment methods.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tCryptoProcessing unveils mass payouts feature for faster crypto payments - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": "This functionality enables businesses to make instant and efficient payments to multiple recipients with a single transfer, simplifying the process for all parties involved.  The feature is particularly beneficial for companies dealing with numerous counterparties, such as freelance platforms, where traditional methods of sending individual cryptocurrency payments can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Mass payouts simplify this process, allowing businesses to complete large volumes of transactions more efficiently. The solution can be applied to various business needs, including payroll, affiliate payouts, vendor payments, and customer refunds. CryptoProcessingby CoinsPaid has over ten years of experience in the cryptocurrency space. The company offers payment solutions to hundreds of merchants worldwide and currently processes over 800 million euros in crypto transactions monthly. In recent years, crypto mass payments have gained traction across industries that rely on paying many freelancers, contractors, or international vendors. With the shift toward remote work and globalised business operations, companies are increasingly turning to cryptocurrency as a fast and cost-effective method to disburse payments. Traditional payment systems can be slow, costly, and cumbersome, especially when handling cross-border transactions. As businesses seek more scalable and efficient solutions, mass payouts in crypto have emerged as an attractive alternative, reducing both transaction times and fees while enabling near-instant transfers across borders. Freelance platforms, affiliate networks, and international service providers are some of the key industries benefiting from these mass crypto payment solutions. For businesses managing hundreds or thousands of contractors or partners, the ability to execute bulk payments with minimal administrative burden is a major advantage. Services like CryptoProcessing by CoinsPaid cater to this growing demand by offering streamlined mass payout systems, which allow businesses to process large volumes of transactions with a single transfer, significantly cutting down on time and manual effort. This has made cryptocurrency a more appealing option for companies looking to manage payments more efficiently.

    "news_content": " This integration introduces two Mini Apps within World App, providing users the ability to convert their Worldcoin tokens into goods and services, where the token is available.The collaboration has launched two Mini Apps powered by Cryptorefills' gift card and mobile top-up catalogue. These Mini Apps are accessible on both iOS and Android platforms: These transactions are conducted on World Chain, a Layer 2 blockchain built on the OP Stack, designed for efficiency and scalability. This infrastructure minimises transaction fees and speeds up processing, enhancing the practicality of using cryptocurrency for daily transactions. Beyond the Mini Apps, Cryptorefills has also integrated the World Chain network into its own platform. Customers on Cryptorefills.com can now make purchases with Worldcoin tokens, choosing between the Optimism network or World Chainâs Layer 2 network.    In April 2024, Cryptorefills Labsunveiled a research reporttitled âStablecoins in Crypto-Shopping.â The report explored the burgeoning significance of stablecoins and alternatives to Ethereum's mainnet in facilitating consumer transactions with cryptocurrencies. Through comprehensive analysis, the report provided insights into the preferences and behaviours of crypto-shoppers. Key findings from the report indicated a notable preference for stablecoins among crypto-shoppers, with nearly 80% favouring them over Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies for transactions. Moreover, it was revealed that 62% of consumers engaging in cryptocurrency shopping were more inclined to make purchases if the vendor accepts stablecoins.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tStripe eyes acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " Itâs worth noting that the deal is not yet finalised at the time of writing, and that there is still the possibility that either party could withdraw from the negotiations. This potential acquisition aligns with Stripe's renewed focus on the digital asset sector, following a six-year hiatus from offering cryptocurrency-related services.    Earlier this year, Stripe officials announced the company's return to stablecoin services. They noted that transactions involving stablecoins through Stripe would settle on-chain instantly and automatically convert to fiat currency. In June 2024,Stripe also partnered with Coinbaseto enable fiat-to-crypto onramps and offramps for users of both platforms. This collaboration aimed to provide faster settlements and lower transaction fees for customers in over 150 countries, using stablecoins. In October 2024, Stripe expanded its cryptocurrency offerings by integrating Circle's US Dollar stablecoin (USDC) into its main payments interface. The integration saw immediate interest, with users from more than 70 countries conducting stablecoin transactions on the first day. This reflected the growing demand for tokenised fiat currencies, especially in cross-border payments where fees and long settlement times have historically been a challenge. According to cointelegraph.com, these developments are particularly significant for those involved in remittance services. By using stablecoins, senders and recipients can bypass high fees and delays, making it easier and more affordable to send smaller amounts of money across borders. In a related development, Paxos, the issuer of the Pax stablecoin, launched a new stablecoin payment platform aimed at payment service providers. Unlike individual or small business solutions, this platform enables payment processors to integrate the Paxos API into their systems. Stripe was announced as the first payment processor to incorporate Paxos' API into its operations. Every day we send out a free e-mail with the most important headlines of the last 24 hours.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tRipple unveils RLUSD: USD stablecoin for global financial institutions - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": "The stablecoin will be available on major exchanges such as Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, Independent Reserve, CoinMENA, and Bullish, expanding its reach across global markets.  RLUSD is backed by Ripple's expertise in digital asset infrastructure and regulatory compliance, positioning it as a key player in cross-border payments, tokenization of real-world assets, and decentralized finance (DeFi). The stablecoin is supported by prominent market makers like B2C2 and Keyrock, ensuring strong liquidity and facilitating broader adoption in global markets. The stablecoin is issued under a New York Trust Company Charter, adhering to strict regulatory oversight. RLUSD is built to facilitate real-time global payments and act as a stable bridge between fiat currencies and the crypto ecosystem. It is integrated into Ripple's cross-border payments solution, improving transaction speed, cost, and reliability. The stablecoin is also set to support the tokenization of real-world assets, offering a stable medium for on-chain transactions. The launch of RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains marks a significant step in the growth of decentralized finance. Each RLUSD token is fully backed by US dollar reserves and audited monthly to ensure transparency, adding to its appeal for institutional and retail users alike. Stablecoins have emerged as a crucial component of the digital economy by offering the stability of traditional fiat currencies alongside the benefits of blockchain technology. This price stability makes stablecoins particularly well-suited for use in financial transactions, including cross-border payments, where predictability is key. As a result, they provide a reliable digital alternative to conventional currencies without the risk of significant value fluctuations. Their utility extends beyond payments into DeFi, where stablecoins are often used as collateral or liquidity within lending, borrowing, and trading platforms. By acting as a bridge between fiat currencies and the crypto ecosystem, stablecoins enable users to easily move funds in and out of the blockchain space. They also facilitate the tokenization of real-world assets and improve access to decentralized financial services, driving greater efficiency, transparency, and inclusion within the global financial system. With their growing adoption, stablecoins are positioned to play a foundational role in the modernization of finance.

    "news_content": " This feature rollout was revealed on 8 October 2024, following a recent integration with Google Pay in September. With this new integration, approximately 500,000 users of Alchemy Pay's virtual card can now make payments using Samsung Pay, a mobile payment and digital wallet service from Samsung Electronics. Alchemy Pay has indicated that its virtual card users can now make payments on various platforms, including ChatGPT Plus, the Apple Store, Midjourney, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, and eBay, among others. A representative from Alchemy Pay expressed expectations of increased demand from indirect users resulting from the Samsung Pay integration, highlighting the company's substantial user base and partnerships. This move is not unique to Alchemy Pay; the crypto payment processor has previously collaborated with Samsung Pay. In 2020, Samsung Pay partnered with the payment gateway Swipe to allow payments from Swipe Visa card balances. For users interested in utilising the Alchemy Pay virtual card with Samsung Pay, they can visit the Alchemy Pay website to check compatibility. Once confirmed, they can add their virtual card to Samsung Pay through the app and begin making cryptocurrency payments.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tVisa to downsize its team to optimise its international business - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": "According to sources familiar with the matter, Visa intends to fire around 1,400 employees and contractors to advance its strategy to simplify its international business. Initially reported by theWall Street Journal, the announcement stated that approximately 1,000 of the cuts are projected to remove technology positions, with the majority of the layoffs being focused on Visaâs merchant sales and global digital partnership roles. The report mentions that a part of the layoffs ensued a week before the news dropped, with Visa encouraging individuals to apply for open positions. However, Visa intends to maintain its workers in the global digital partnership teams employed in their positions through the end of 2024. According to a Visa representative cited byReuters, the company works towards evolving its operational model to advance its growth, which can in turn lead to the elimination of some roles currently present. Despite this, Visa plans to employ more individuals each year for the foreseeable future, depending on its needs and demands. Recently, Visa has been facing legal issues and was under scrutiny from regulators, as well as dissatisfied merchants. For example, inSeptember 2024, The US Justice Department sued Visa for monopolising the debit card market, charging significant fees, and inhibiting competition. The civil antitrust lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, charged the company with violating sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act due to more than 60% of debit transactions in the US running on its debit network. Moreover, Visa was alleged to unlawfully amassed the capability to extract fees that exceeded what it could charge in a competitive market. At the same time, merchants and banks transferred those funds to consumers by scaling prices or by minimising the quality of services. This led to Visaâs conduct negatively impacting the price of everything. The lawsuit was filed to reinstate competition in the market and to support the US public.

Through the process of integrating with the Visa Direct network, Coinbase clients will be enabled to deposit funds into their accounts in real-time using eligible Visa debit cards. In addition, both financial institutions will continue to focus on meeting the needs, preferences, and demands of customers and users in an ever-evolving market, while prioritising the process of remaining compliant with the regulatory requirements and laws of the local industries as well.  The new feature is expected to enable Coinbase to unlock real-time delivery of account funds for those who are leveraging an eligible Visa debit card.

    "news_content": "Following this announcement, the Workflow was powered by the NVIDIA AI platform onAWSin order to optimise the manner in which financial service organisations save money and mitigate risk. By leveraging accelerated data processing and optimising algorithms, the product is expected to improve AIâs ability to detect and prevent credit card transaction fraud as well. The Workflow will also identify subtle patterns and anomalies in transaction data that are based on user behavior, aiming to enhance accuracy and reduce false positives compared with traditional methods. Customers will have the possibility to streamline the migration of their fraud detection workflows from traditional compute to accelerated compute while leveraging the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform and the NVIDIA GPU instances.  According to the official press release, the new NVIDIA Workflow will accelerate data processing, model training, and inference, while also demonstrating how these components can be wrapped into a single, easy-to-use software product. The Workflow can also be adapted for use cases such as new account fraud, account takeover, and money laundering, as the new tool is currently optimised for credit card transaction fraud. At the same time, the NVIDIA AI Workflow for fraud detection will also improve XGBoost in order to create and train a model that can then be orchestrated with the NVIDIA Morpheus Runtime Core library and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for real-time inferencing. Systems integrators, software vendors, and cloud service providers will have the possibility to integrate the new NVIDIA AI Workflow for fraud detection in order to boost their financial services applications and optimise the manner in which companies keep clientsâ money, identities, and digital accounts safe.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tCiti partners with Google cloud to expand AI capabilities - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " This collaboration will see Citi migrating multiple workloads and applications to Google Cloudâs secure and scalable infrastructure, with a focus on enhancing operational efficiency and advancing high-performance computing and analytics capabilities. Under the terms of the partnership, Citi plans to leverage Google Cloudâs Vertex AI platform to incorporate generative AI solutions into various business processes. This will support Citiâs AI-driven initiatives for developer tools, document processing, and digitisation, tools intended to enhance the efficiency of customer service teams. Officials from Citi highlighted the companyâs commitment to modernising its infrastructure and improving the speed and safety of its services. They also emphasised that, by using Google Cloud, the company gains access to new opportunities to run applications with better speed and precision, equipping teams with the resources they need to effectively serve clients.    Google Cloudâs security framework provides a solid foundation for financial institutions to move forward with digital transformation while meeting rigorous data protection and regulatory standards. The platformâs defence-in-depth security model includes encryption protocols for data at rest, in transit, and during processing through Confidential Computing, as well as compliance with industry standards like PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and SOC 2. In essence, Google Cloudâs infrastructure and AI platforms aim to provide the security and scalability necessary for Citi to meet evolving client and regulatory demands while laying the groundwork for wider adoption of digital and AI-driven solutions. In September 2024, Citigroup announced a partnership with Apollo in an initiative to lend up to USD 25 billion to private equity groups and low-rated companies in the US. This move was part of Citigroupâs strategy to establish a foothold in the growing private credit market, where traditional banks have been withdrawing from riskier lending. The collaboration aimed to finance a minimum of USD 25 billion in private equity and corporate loans over the coming years, with a target of USD 5 billion in the first year. Loans will be sourced by Citigroupâs investment banking team and funded by Apollo, using capital from its direct lending funds, insurance subsidiary Athene, and Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tNew CFPB rule on consumer data: Open Banking in the US - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": "Steve Boms,Â Founder and President ofAllon Advocacy, shares key insights on the CFPB's new rule, which strengthens data privacy, expands Open Banking, and reshapes bank-fintech ties.  The final rule prioritises privacy protections by requiring third parties to provide consumers with an authorisation disclosure. This disclosure specifies who will access the data, for what purpose, and for how long, and includes clear instructions on how consumers can opt out of data retention or usage at any time. The rule restricts data usage strictly to the purpose the consumer has consented to, allowing no other secondary uses, except for improving the product or service covered by the initial consent. Additionally, the rule sets a maximum authorisation period of 12 months. If consumers donât renew their consent, third parties must stop collecting and delete any previously authorised data.  It's a game-changer. While the US has already seen market-driven Open Banking, this rule levels the playing field so all consumers benefit, regardless of their bank. For instance, in payments, it can greatly expand access to Pay-by-Bank options, which offer lower transaction fees than credit or debit cards â savings that ultimately benefit consumers. It also broadens access to affordable credit by enabling cash flow-based underwriting. Beyond third-party services, this competitive shift may prompt traditional financial institutions to lower fees and offer similar services at reduced costs. Increased competition will also encourage providers, whether banks or third parties, to work harder to earn customer loyalty â a positive outcome for consumers.  In some areas, the CFPB rule aligns fully with existing consumer data protection laws, but in others, it goes further. For example, its broad ban on secondary data usage extends beyond whatâs seen in most jurisdictions. Academic research, for instance, is not an allowed use case, unless consumers give explicit consent for it as the primary purpose, ensuring their data cannot be shared for research that might have unforeseen consequences. Similarly, data cannot be used to develop new products or services, nor for enhancing cash flow or credit models. While preventing 'bait and switch' practices is widely supported, this rule may be somewhat more restrictive than similar regulations elsewhere.  Overall, it compares quite favourably. However, it's important to clarify that this rule focuses solely on Open Banking â not Open Finance. The CFPB has limited its scope to checking, savings, credit card, and digital wallet accounts for now, unlike other markets that have moved faster to include broader account types like mortgages, auto loans, and small business accounts. This is an initial step, but one that aligns well with international frameworks. The resulting benefits are clear: more competition, lower fees, and increased innovation. Notably, the CFPB has emphasised that this rule is just the start, with more rules expected in the coming years, moving gradually toward a fully Open Finance model.  A major banking trade association quickly sued the CFPB, claiming this rule exceeded its statutory authority. This reaction is disappointing, especially since banks have long urged the CFPB to eliminate screen scraping and transition to APIs, which this rule accomplishes for covered accounts. Itâs surprising how rapidly the banks were able to review the 600-page rule and file a lawsuit within 12 hours of its finalisation. The future of bank-fintech relationships is complex; data sharing under Section 1033 is only one aspect. US prudential regulators have requested information on broader bank-fintech arrangements beyond data sharing. Ideally, regulators will clarify that data sharing under Section 1033 isnât a traditional bank-fintech relationship but simply reflects consumersâ directive to share their data. This will, however, require further guidance from prudential regulators, which I hope to see.  I believe the CFPB's approach to timelines is quite reasonable. This aspect marks one of the most significant changes from last year's proposal to the finalised version. Smaller institutions will need time to implement APIs, and they will depend on their core providers for support. However, as we approach 2024, these institutions effectively have five and a half years to achieve compliance. During this period, the CFPB will recognise one or more standard-setting bodies, so banks wonât have to develop their own APIs; they can utilise the industry-approved technical standards with assistance from their core providers. Moreover, I see small banks as key beneficiaries of this rule because Open Banking allows them to reach customers outside their traditional geographical areas. In an environment where smaller banks have been increasingly acquired by larger ones, this rule presents an opportunity for them to act not only as data providers but also as data recipients. Rather than viewing this as a challenge, I see it as a chance for small banks to explore innovative ways to enhance their competitiveness.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tAssessing European fintechs in 2024: resilience, shifting focus, and emerging trends - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": "2024 continued to be a turbulent year for European fintechs. Although funding continued to decline, the sector is much more resilient with some green shoots on the horizon. While funding dropped by 25% as fewer deals came to market, there is also less funding is required post the focus on profitability. The sector also saw some positive news âÂ higher interest rates resulted in record profits for challenger banks and attracted large rounds (Monzo, Revolut) which gave a boost to funding combined with the end of the crypto winter. In general, unicorn chasing has subdued, with the focus now shifting towards backing more sustainable, B2B software businesses as the next evolution.  The challenges that fintech faced in 2023 were necessary for the sector to mature and become more sustainable. While funding may be down, and unicorn chasing has slowed, there is plenty of opportunity for companies that are capital efficient and have a clear path to profit. AI has taken the fintech sector by storm, with several public announcements from insurers or BNPL players on the success they have had in implementing these solutions. I expect more money to go to B2B solutions as the share of funding will increase to over 70% over B2C. With AI transforming the industry and significant dry powder still available, we believe the next 12-18 months will mark a turning point for fintechs in Europe.  There have been a couple of mishaps in BaaS, leading to increased regulatory scrutiny (Railsr, Solaris). I believe a winner is emerging in broader banking infrastructure, and additional opportunities for investment will remain slim. The one area where further niche solutions can become large markets is around payment reconciliation and client money protection. This is critical for Embedded Finance to truly establish itself as a leading driver of the BaaS movement. Of course, getting a licence is not easy, and far and few will be given, so the winner will already have had a licence.  In short, an API-first strategy. I expect a move beyond account-to-account payments which has been a core recipient of the broader Open Banking Era to have account information services more readily available to a diverse set of audiences. While we have talked about it for ages, very few people still use Open Banking to make credit decisions, reference their customers, and provide truly personalised services. In addition, the proliferation of Embedded Finance products in other industries beyond consumer facing fintech apps will be something to watch out for: retail, healthcare, hospitality, and travel. The insurance industry has seen the most benefit, but others can too.    I am most interested in ClearBank (the leading licenced player which is making inroads), Mambu (non-banking licence approach to providing technology), and Griffin (the up-and-coming startup). There is a lot of UK focus in general here, but there are questions around who becomes the leader in Europe as Solaris focuses on Germany. The competitive landscape is likely to continue evolving, with providers focusing on niche markets, technological advancements, and customer-centric solutions to gain a competitive edge.  Increasing regulatory complexities and cybersecurity threats will make robust compliance and security measures indispensable. BaaS providers that adeptly navigate these challenges while delivering innovative, customer-centric services are likely to dominate the market, drawing substantial interest from investors and clients alike. I expected moderate growth over the next three to five years, driven by supportive regulations like PSD2, rising demand for digital and embedded financial services, and technological advancements in AI.  In Europe's competitive BaaS sector, startups aiming to attract investment must strategically showcase their ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes âÂ demonstrating compliance with PSD2, GDPR, and AML directives âÂ to mitigate investor concerns over legal risks. They need to highlight technological innovation by leveraging cutting-edge technologies ensuring their platforms are scalable and secure to handle rapid growth and cyber threats. Articulating a clear, differentiated value proposition backed by market validation and existing traction with clients or partnerships is crucial.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tThe advantages of an accountable fraud provider to deter ecommerce fraud - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " Every 1 USD of fraud costs the merchant 3 USD in the form of chargebacks, chargeback fees, and potential penalties. There are also the costs of lost merchandise, harm to the investorâs confidence, and other indirect costs, all of which mean that the impact of fraud on margins in any given quarter can be enormous and hard to predict. Compounding the threat to profitability is the fact that ecommerce merchants may over-decline legitimate orders in the name of preventing fraud. And declining too many good orders not only costs you in revenue but can also cost you good customers. However, by working with an accountable fraud partner, merchants can reduce the costs of fraud and its impact on revenue and margins. With an accountable partner, clients receive a chargeback guarantee that shifts the costs of fraud chargebacks from the merchant to the fraud partner. The success of the partnerâs business model depends on their ability to accurately differentiate between good and bad customers, which requires heavy-duty AI and ongoing investment in R&D. Anon-accountable fraud vendor, on the other hand, doesnât provide chargeback liability, and their business model incentivises them to under invest in R&D. They make the same revenue whether they catch half of the fraud or all of it, and it would even be irresponsible for the CEO of such a vendor to heavily invest in R&D, since it delivers no ROI for them. Most merchants think that non-accountable platforms cost less because their pre-transaction fees appear lower. However, businesses should consider the cost of chargebacks (and associated costs) they will have to pay with a non-accountable vendor, as well as the disparity in performance, potentially resulting in lower approval rates and revenue. An accountable fraud partner takes on financial responsibility â ensuring that fraud canât hurt their partnersâ revenue or profits through three mechanisms. First, an approval rate SLA sets a floor on the share of orders that the partner will approve. For instance, the partner commits to approving 98% of the merchantâs orders over the next two years, which allows the CFO to eliminate this variable from revenue forecasts. Second, an accountable fraud partner offers a chargeback guarantee that shifts the costs of chargebacks with a fraud reason code from the merchant to the partner. When the partner approves an order that is reported as fraud by the cardholder, the partner reimburses the merchant for the chargeback cost. This incentivises the partner to keep chargebacks low and make accurate order decisions. Finally, an accountable partnerâs performance-based fee structure rewards the fraud partner only for approved transactions and provides a disincentive to over-decline orders. As essential as the chargeback guarantee, this fee setup compels the partner to actively bolster revenues and profitability by maximising valid approvals even beyond what the SLA requires. Combined, these elements keep the partnerâs goals fully aligned with the merchantâs objectives. This arrangement also drives accountable partners to make highly accurate decisions. As a result, the partner is motivated to innovate and invest heavily in data science and risk modelling, allowing the merchant to benefit from the latest technologies, methodologies, and AI, without making investments to build this technology from scratch. Minimising risk exposure is a core responsibility of a CFO in any organisation. In ecommerce, the danger of a major fraud attack is always lurking, creating not only a constant threat of losses but also an ongoing forecasting nightmare â an acute concern for public companies. An isolated fraud attack can spiral into a seven-figure event if itâs not dealt with immediately. Chargebacks and associated costs are a forecasting wildcard, especially with legacy anti-fraud strategies. Having an accountable fraud partner eliminates the unpredictability of fraud costs from the forecasting equation and sets a floor on the total order volume the business can approve. The CFO knows exactly what their minimum approval rate will be, as the liability of paying chargebacks belongs to the accountable fraud partner. In fact, the CFO can predict precisely how much this partnership will increase profits and margins. Non-accountable vendors that provide non-guaranteed recommendations typically try to steer merchants toward âuncovered decisionsâ or âscoresâ because itâs cheaper and safer for them. They have minimal incentive to identify emerging fraud trends quickly since they are not liable. On the flip side, their performance guarantees are meaningless. itâs trivial for them to offer an approval rate SLAâitâs easy to âapproveâ 100% of orders when you have no liability if you make a mistake. Similarly, their machine learning models tend to be relatively lightweight and serve better to just screen out egregious fraud. On the other hand, an accountable partner will invest extensively in expensive data science architecture, like models that monitor data drift and detect anomalies. Overall, an accountable partner offers clear decisions and guaranteed financial outcomes. A non-accountable vendor offers suggestions and bears no cost for subpar tech.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tHow cloud modernisation is accelerating payments innovation - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " Companies across all industries have turned to cloud modernisation for upgraded scalability, resilience, and the way it allows organisations to integrate their solutions into larger ecosystems of applications. This last point is game-changing for banks and their approach to payments. When done right, managing payments and supporting services in a cloud-based ecosystem means they can accelerate time-to-value for new applications and capabilities. And, when they can bring new products to market faster, they can differentiate themselves from competitors further to improve customer satisfaction and, ultimately, grow revenue.  Modernising legacy payment systems is extremely complex â itâs akin to rocket science due to its critical nature. Banks must balance the need to innovate with the non-negotiable need to ensure stable operations in a low-risk, highly compliant environment. The headline challenge is the need to maintain the highest levels of scalability, reliability, and resilience at the same time as undergoing a major transformation. The goal is to transition to new technologies that accelerate time-to-market for innovative solutions without compromising the existing systems' performance. Existing operations must continue to operate smoothly and securely.  The best way to mitigate these risks is to partner with a company that has both deep expertise in advanced technology and extensive experience in banking and payment systems. Few partners can match ACIâs decades of experience operating resilient and reliable infrastructures. We support financial institutions that handle trillions of dollars in daily transactions. That demands a deep commitment to excellence and reliability. By leveraging our experience, banks can modernise their systems with a clear understanding of potential risks and a strategic approach to navigating them.  This topic is close to my heart. Iâve dedicated more than 15 years to supporting underserved communities and advancing financial inclusion. The headline for me is that cloud technology and innovation makes financial services more cost-effective and accessible. It empowers banks, payment providers, and merchants to offer solutions that are more user-friendly and interactive, especially at the point of sale. Cloud technology is also a pathway to faster development of mobile banking and payments innovations, which are critical for unbanked and underbanked communities. For these groups, mobile phones are often their primary access to both computing technology and the internet. Leveraging cloud technology to improve mobile payment experiences and expand use cases at the point of sale will dramatically expand financial inclusion. When merchants can easily adopt more flexible and inclusive payment options solutions, it makes financial services more accessible and convenient for consumers at a much faster pace.  The growing resilience and scalability of cloud solutions will play a crucial role in advancing payment systems. ACI is heavily investing in modernizing our platform architecture to support innovation in instant payments, including central infrastructure, critical high-value payments, and card-based payments. Weâll also see a more interconnected financial technology landscape as public cloud ecosystems become more integrated with core banking and ERP systems. That will make it easier and quicker for companies to develop new, impactful solutions. We're excited to see how these innovations evolve and to play our part in supporting intelligent payment orchestration that benefits both consumers and businesses. Finally, using responsibly collected payments data to derive valuable insights is a growing focus. Weâve expanded the remit of our Payments Intelligence division beyond fraud prevention and into developing data analytics applications that improve digital identity verification and more streamlined customer experiences. We believe that harnessing these insights will lead to faster, more secure transactions and a better financial services overall for both consumers and businesses. Scotty Perkins is a payments, technology, and compliance leader with deep expertise in payments, retail, and consumer financial services. With nearly 30 years of experience, he has held senior positions in operations, compliance, technology, and business development, specialising in complex business process design for large-scale revenue optimisation programmes.  ACI Worldwide, an original innovator in global payments technology, delivers transformative software solutions that power intelligent payments orchestration in real time so banks, billers, and merchants can drive growth, while continuously modernising their payment infrastructures, simply and securely.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tBest practices and strategies airlines can use for navigating forex  - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " The impact of currency can be huge for airlines that operate globally and have exposure in many currencies. Itâs not without reason that almost every airlineâs yearly fiscal report includes remarks about the impact and result of foreign exchange (forex). And often the context is negative. Most of their cost â staff and fuel often being the biggest ones â are in one or two currencies whereas their revenues are in many different ones, so there is a mismatch and consequently an exposure (risk). To address this, airlines need to make proper planning per currency, calculate their exposure, and look for natural hedges in the first place â e.g., try to pay more in local currency for services like catering, airport charges, overflying fees, and fuel costs. The solution is a combination of cash and currency management. Full-service airlines often have a professional Treasury desk and manage a variety of currencies themselves â either by in-house measures or by ad-hoc currency instruments with banks and financial institutions. Low-cost airlines, mostly smaller, might not have this capability themselves and likely have to outsource it to financial parties. When airlines are members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have agent sales as well, they will use IATA Currency Clearance Service (ICCS) â for Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP)/Cargo Account Settlement Systems (CASS) revenues â to convert their cashflows from across the globe into a few currencies managed by their Treasury. For their online sales, airlines will instruct their payment service provider (PSP) to do the same. It is essential to have clear agreements about the forex rate applied (including any markup) and the timing of those transactions. Treasuries must manage several risks, including fuel, interest, and forex. The cost of managing these exposures should be considered. This is similar to paying an insurance fee. The cost for forex hedging is derived from the differential in the interest rate of the two currencies. The more volatile or unstable a currency is, the higher the interest and therefore the cost to hedge that specific currency. No one has a crystal ball, but it is advisable to hedge at least a portion of volatile currencies in unstable times. Airlines like consistent results from forex money flows and aim to avoid huge currency fluctuations, which can impact their financial results. To ensure this, they should consult with their banks financial instruments, such as forward contracts, swaps, currency options (derivatives) or non-deliverable forwards (NDFs). Think also of stop-loss or take-profit orders at a certain forex level for a currency pair. Leave overnight orders with your bank to avoid surprises in unstable times. Some airlines also look at what the competition is doing. In many such countries, the process of transferring out funds and obtaining hard currency is quite cumbersome. It often starts with lengthy bureaucratic processes where a copy of tickets must be handed over as well. Because of the unstable situation, the currency can depreciate or even devaluate regularly, ultimately causing a loss for the airline. We worked with the local Board of Airline Representatives (BAR) to establish the fare (the basis) of a ticket in hard currency as much as possible. If financial regulations (often imposed by the Central Bank) mandated it to sell in local currency only, we would convert the fare into the local currency at the time of sale and leverage the prevailing rate of exchange (ROX). By doing so, airlines minimise the exposure in time by eliminating the translational risk and limiting this to a transactional risk only. Airlines operating in countries with unstable economies or restrictive currency regulations can also minimise the number of tickets sold in that country/currency and dynamically steer to sales from incoming traffic. Sales, Revenue Management, and Treasury have to cooperate closely in this case. Currency management is not just a responsibility of the Treasury, although they have to teach and educate other relevant departments. If exposure still exists, airlines can look for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that often need money for projects in that country and, thus, are short in that currency. Fund them locally with your surpluses in local currency and charge their head office in hard currency at a mid-rate, creating a mutually beneficial agreement. It is important to ensure that this is legal, but it should be noted that there's room for creativity and collaboration with local parties as well. Finally, in these markets, NDFs are often excellent external financial instruments. Although NDFs do not convert your currency locally, they settle the difference in ROX in hard currency at an agreed moment in time in the future. One of the most rewarding projects I did in my 30 years working for an airline was implementing a multi-currency service called Multi Currency Pricing (MCP). It was like changing your payment department from a cost centre into a profit centre. In the online sales environment, MCP allows customers to pay in their home currency rather than in the default currency of the airlinesâ website and so shift the currency margin from the (card) issuing bank to the airline, without this being an additional charge to the customer. It can be applied to cards but also to several other payment options.  Source: a co-production of Payments Taking Off and Up In The Air in a joint webinar in April 2024 Everyone can relate more to the value or cost of something if it is expressed in their own currency. Thus, allowing customers to pay in their preferred currency also increases sales conversion simply because customers feel more comfortable and understand the value better. When using MCP or Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC), the customer knows exactly what to pay in their currency at the moment of checkout on the airlineâs website rather than at the moment of receiving their statement from the bank with the forex conversion including a forex markup, which often comes as a surprise. This guarantee of knowing the exact amount at checkout leads to an increase in customer satisfaction as well. Apart from that, MCP and DCC are an ongoing revenue stream to the airline (a financial ancillary). It becomes a win-win with the customer if airlines charge a forex markup lower than what the customer normally would pay through their issuer. MCP and DCC are commission-based ancillaries which are quite rewarding both from a financial and marketing perspective. There are some companies out there that provide this as their core service and can also advise airlines on how to offer and position it on their website. They can adjust the markup depending on the payment option or the currency pair, allowing airlines to be flexible. When selecting such a company as a merchant, it is advisable to do your research properly to find out which proposition best fits your requirements. Some vendors of MCP/DCC are more flexible than others, some are more IT and process focussed, whereas others are more financial/bank (hedging) orientated. Currency and forex are often seen as something vague, unclear, and mysterious â and considered simply as the cost of doing business. With a good and proper forex strategy, airlines can save a lot of money and even make some profit from it.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tChile: 2024 analysis of payments and ecommerce trends - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " A majorjoint report by South American central bankscovering payment data from 2018 to 2022, published in September this year, confirms a widely perceived pattern in the region: the rapid growth of digital payments and the emergence of real-time transactions (through digital wallets or other instant payment rails). Chile, in particular, has seen its payments industry boom, accounting for the regionâs second-highest volume of retail payments as a share of GDP, behind only Brazil (see below) â something directly linked to the maturity of its economy in terms of financial inclusion and digitalisation. Source:South American Central Banks' Primer Reporte de Sistemas de Pago de SudamÃ©rica (RSPS) *Retail payments include transfers, direct debit transactions, cards and e-instruments. For years, Chile has been the Latin American nation with themost access to financial services and connectivity. In the latestsurveyby the telecommunications superintendence (SUBTEL) with CADEM, in 2023, 94.3% of Chileans said they had access to the Internet â 24% more than in 2015. Almost half (48.9%) indicated access to financial services as the main reason for paying for such connectivity. This was decisive for Chileâs development of its digital commerce market before others. According to a study by Kantar IBOPE Media,seven out of ten Chileans have made an online purchase during the past six months, and 23% have bought products online once a month. However, proprietary data from Payments and Commerce Market Intelligence (PCMI) indicates international purchases still have a lot of room to grow in Chile,accounting for 25% of the market. This means that cross-border payment solutions have a vital role in developing the country's digital commerce. Global players' increasing acceptance of alternative payment methods (APMs) is crucial for the growth and development of international ecommerce. Online purchases through mobile devices surpassed those on desktops in 2022 and have continuously grown, accounting for 59% of ecommerce volume in 2024, as per PCMI data. PCMIâs latest estimates for 2024 also show that credit cards are the most used method in Chile for ecommerce purchases (60%), followed by debit cards (20%), and bank transfers (9%). While Chileans mostly use credit cards to pay for Software-as-a-Service- (SaaS) and travel-related purchases, debit cards are mostly used for ride-hailing and delivery expenses, and bank transfers for retail. Top ecommerce payment methods share in Chile per vertical Source: PCMI E-Commerce Data Library, 2024 The fourth edition of the Credicorp Financial Inclusion Index (IIF) with Ipsos identified Chile asthe country that makes the best use of the financial system in Latin America, with 90% of people over 18 having a debit card. This high penetration of the method helps explain why alternatives to digital wallets have not gained much traction in the country, unlike in other places in the region. PCMI data shows that even within retail purchases, wallet transactions account for less than 10%. New players entering the market, such as Apple Pay in August last year, may help to change this scenario in the long term. Mercado Libre's Mercado Pago (which has nearly 5 million customers in Chile) is currently the leading challenger in the segment. Top digital wallets in Chile per payments share Source: PCMI E-Commerce Data Library, 2024 Among bank transfer services, PCMI data shows that Webpay and Khipu are the leading players, with 74% and 16% of the market share, respectively. Debit cards are also Chileâs leading payment method for in-person payments, accounting for 37% of the financial volume at the point-of-sale (POS), according toWorldpay'sGlobal Payments Report 2024. Top POS payment methods in Chile Source: Worldpay's Global Payments Report 2024 Worldpay's study also shows Redcompra as the country's leading card scheme, with a 44% market share, followed by Mastercard (29%), Visa (27%), and Amex (1%). That is because Redcompra, managed by Transbank through Banco de Chile ATM's networks, is theonly company in the country authorisedto process debit and prepaid cards issued by banks â meaning it widely caters to consumers who don't have credit cards. According toPCMI data, Banco del Estado de Chile and Banco Santander are the biggest issuers of debit cards, while CMR Falabella has a significant share of credit card issuance. Debit card issuers' market share in Chile Source: PCMI 2024 Credit card issuers' market share in Chile Source: PCMI E-commerce Data Library, 2023 PCMIâs latest estimates point to a slowdown in Chileâs digital commerce market in the coming years, but with payments volumes still growing steadily, from USD 31.6 billion in 2023 to USD 42.7 billion in 2026. While an overall picture is important, focusing on consumer behaviour delivers a deeper understanding of the market drivers. Over60% of consumers in Chile use large retail storessuch as Falabella, Lider, or Ripley to buy online. More than half of online shoppers in Chile (53%) arebetween 26 and 55 years old, according to the Santiago Chamber of Commerce (CÃ¡mara de Comercio de Santiago or CSS), which tracks ecommerce data. CCS data also classifies the following as thebest-selling ecommerce product categories in Chile: Clothing (46%) Footwear (30%) Food (25%) Electronics (24%) Beauty (21%). Looking at Latin America, we see that underpenetrated markets like Paraguay or Bolivia still need to enable alternative payments and migrate in-person retail volume to ecommerce to see digital commerce growth happen. On the other hand, highly penetrated markets like Chile, Brazil, and Colombia depend on driving user experience and payment method innovation to keep growing and becoming more digitally competitive. The high concentration of the Chilean banking industry is, however, an obstacle to this. Earlier this year, Bicecorp and Grupo Security announced they would merge their businesses, creating a new institution ranking seventh in the countryâs banking industry, with more than 2.4 million clients. Mergershave become a standard procedurein an already concentrated market. Since 2007, the Chilean market has gone from 25 to 17 banks, a decrease of more than a third of the players, meaning the only way to reach more clients is through these mergers. However, some fintech companies seek the licences necessary to compete with Chilean incumbents. This is the case of Tanner, which has already obtained the first authorisation from theComisiÃ³n para el Mercado Financiero(CMF) for three verifications that it must get to become a bank. It is the first company to pursue this path in ten years. Tenpo is also doing this. The fintech, which already offers some financial services, has submitted its first application to the CMF for a banking licence. According to the sixth edition ofFintech Radar Chile, prepared by Finnovista, Chile has348 active fintech startups, an increase of 16% compared to the previous year. For experts, the so-called Fintech Law, approved in 2022, andin force since 2023, has been crucial in breaking down barriers and establishing transparency, security, and consumer protection rules. The recent regulation of Open Finance, which came in the wake of the new law, is an example of this. However, there is still a long way to go before the law is fully implemented and information sharing truly becomes a competitive advantage for competitors over incumbents. The current global venture capital winter is another challenge for Chilean fintechs in scaling their operations. Data from LAVCA, the association for private capital investment in Latin America, shows thatventure capital investment in the region has experienced significant growth in recent years. It peaked in 2021 at USD 16 billion, before declining in 2022 (USD 7.9 billion) and 2023 (USD 4 billion). Chile was the fourth leading investment destination last year, attracting USD 238 million. LAVCA says Latin America is entering a stabilisation period, meaning investment will continue to flow, albeit slower. In this context, it seems easier for large banks to advance in digitalisation and financial inclusion. One example is Banco de Chileâs FAN debit account. Launched in 2022, it already hasmore than 1.4 million customersâ a significant amount in a nation of just 19 million inhabitants. Banco Falabella, in turn, has taken a different path, one of further concentration, to expand its digital services. Itdecided to gradually incorporatethe more than 2.3 million customers of its digital wallet, Fpay, into its banking app, forcing consumers to open a digital account with the financial institution. It remains to be seen whether fintech competitors will be able to burst the existing concentration bubble before it grows even larger. A KawesLab analysis shows thatChinese ecommerce platforms accounted for half of Chileansâ online international purchases in 2023. AliExpress led the segment, with 35% of cross-border transactions, while fast-fashion platform Shein came in third, with 13%. Between the two was US-based Amazon, at 18%. Temu, which debuted in Chile in the second half of last year, accounted for 3% of cross-border sales. As in other major Latin American markets, Asian ecommerce giants will likely drive the growth of international shopping in Chile. The segment will be the only one to grow double digits in the coming years: 15% on average until 2027, per PCMI estimates. Similarly to neighbouringColombia, Chile's monetary authority has been imposing interoperability rules to encourage innovation within the payments industry and the emergence of instant payment solutions. It does not intend to create its proprietary system for real-time payments (RTP) transactions, as Brazil did. Instead, its focus is to enable the industry itself to develop solutions based on the standardisation of QR codes and account-to-account (A2A) transfers. The institution's chairwoman, Rosanna Costa,recently saidthat the Central Bank has also included strengthening its Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System as a fundamental part of its 2023/2027 strategic plan, as it understands that it will need to support an increasingly large number of instant transactions.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tEcommerce's hidden foe: the fight against card-not-present fraud - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " Card-not-present (CNP) fraud has been a growing tumour within the digital economy since its inception. This cancer is fuelled by ecommerce growth and the ever-evolving tactics of fraudsters, leading to continuously increasing âhealthcareâ costs. According to Juniper Research, online payment fraud has resulted in USD 38 billion in losses for ecommerce merchants in 2023 and is expected to grow by approximately 20% annually for the foreseeable future. Consumers are the ones paying the losses through higher prices for goods and services. To combat this mostly invisible but very real adversary, we must delve into the prevailing trends, potential implications, and management strategies of CNP fraud. CNP fraud encompasses a range of deceptive activities that exploit online transactions. The most prevalent methods include: Carding attacks, where fraudsters use automated bots to test large numbers of card numbers to verify their validity. This usually entails obtaining card details from hacked databases and using them for unauthorised transactions. First-party fraud, when legitimate cardholders make a purchase and then claim that the transaction was unauthorised, resulting in a chargeback. Phishing, social engineering, and account takeovers, during which fraudsters trick individuals into providing their card details by pretending to be legitimate businesses, through deceptive emails and websites, or make purchases using the stored payment information. Triangulation, when a fraudster sets up a fake online store, sells goods at attractive prices, and uses stolen card information to buy and ship the goods to the buyer. All companies are affected by these, including Amazon, eBay, and Eneba. One example of CNP fraud we have observed over recent years is a variation of triangulation fraud. In this scenario, fraudsters skip the creation of a counterfeit store and establish a Telegram channel that advertises purchasing significantly discounted products (often at half the original cost). Interested buyers contact fraudsters with their desired product details and pay upfront. The fraudsters then complete the purchase on the website using stolen card information, which eventually comes back as a chargeback. This scheme illustrates the possibility of a collusion between legitimate consumers and the fraudsters, with the former knowingly complicit in the fraudulent transaction. Fraudsters exploit any vulnerability in online payment systems, and the anonymity of digital transactions makes it easier to perpetrate undetected fraud. For consumers, CNP fraud results in unauthorised charges, loss of funds, and disputing fraudulent transactions. For ecommerce, âThe True Cost of Fraudâ study by LexisNexis estimated that for every 1 USD of lost value due to fraud, the actual costs are more than three times higher, due to additional costs. Beyond financial losses, CNP fraud can severely damage a businessâs reputation. Consumer trust is the âholy grailâ in digital commerce, and repeated incidents of fraud can erode this trust. It is paramount to employ sophisticated fraud prevention measures, which naturally result in increased costs and usually lead to higher prices for goods and services, making the overall economy suffer. Completely eradicating CNP fraud might be impossible without sacrificing privacy or introducing an unbearable amount of friction for customers. However, we can significantly reduce its impact through a multi-layered approach. This involves technology, data analysis, and collaboration. There are numerous fraud prevention tools on the market aiding businesses to protect themselves and their customers. These include 3D-Secure authentication, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) based on behavioural analytics, which analyse transaction patterns and detect anomalies indicative of fraud. Real-time fraud detection systems flag suspicious transactions for further review before being processed, reducing the likelihood of successful fraud. Fraudsters constantly develop new tactics, but the adaptive ML allows for ongoing adjustment of detection methods based on emerging trends. As the volume of ecommerce transactions grows, AI and ML systems can efficiently analyse massive datasets for risks, without sacrificing accuracy and customer experience with redundant security checks. Another notable solution is Dark Web monitoring. This involves continuously scanning dark/deep websites (such as hacker forums) for signs of leaked credentials or exposed infrastructure vulnerabilities. Fraudsters often purchase large volumes of compromised card credentials, known as âcard dumpsâ, and exploit them on ecommerce websites. The table below shows the number of deep web mentions of leading ecommerce websites worldwide (February 2024) confirming the attractiveness of the sector for fraudsters.  Embracing deeper collaboration and information sharing is the next critical step to mitigate fraud. Each entity - businesses, banks, law enforcement - has a piece of the puzzle. Sharing data on fraudulent activities, suspicious actors, and emerging tactics allows for a more comprehensive view of the CNP fraud landscape. By connecting these dots, we can identify fraud rings, track stolen card information across transactions, develop more effective preventative measures, and improve ML/AI models faster. In essence, information silos are a fraudsterâs best friend. Breaking down these barriers through collaboration is crucial for creating a united front against CNP fraud. Overall, adopting advanced technological solutions, employing behavioural analytics, and fostering collaboration are essential for businesses to protect themselves and their customers from CNP fraud. Combining these efforts with proactive customer education and internal training is crucial for maintaining consumer trust and ensuring long-term success and ecommerce security.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tPSD3/PSR, DORA, and more â what comes with the next wave of payment regulations? - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": "Dr. Carlos Nasher, Managing Partner atThede Consulting, analyses the impact of PSD3/PSR and DORA on the payments industry, exploring what it means for merchants and banks.  Between the dynamic poles of regulation, cyber security, and digitalisation, future drivers are having a major impact on todayâs payment industry. This article, the second in a three-part series, takes a closer look at current and planned regulatory adjustments.The first articlepresented the current initiatives shaping payment digitalisation in Europe â the digital euro. The payment industry is continuously evolving, driven primarily by technological advancements and regulatory changes such as PSD3/PSR, FiDA, Instant Payment, and DORA. These developments present significant opportunities but also pose substantial challenges that require thorough preparation. What impact will these new directives and regulations have on the payment industry, and what do they mean for banks and payment service providers?  Figure 1: Triangle of digitalisation, regulation, and cyber security in the payment industry   With the currently discussed directives PSD3 (Payment Service Directive 3) and PSR (Payment Service Regulation) the European Commission sets out a specific vision for harmonised and secure payment transactions and fair competition within the European Economic Area. The upcoming directive PSD3 builds on the previous directive PSD2. The main focus is on Strong Customer Authentication and the transparent organisation of payment transactions. PSR supplements PSD3 and leads to a directly applicable law in all EU member states. The drafts for PSD3 and PSR were published in 2023. Since then, the regulations are under review. Both directives are expected to take place in the second half of 2025. Banks have the chance to offer new services by integrating innovative technologies and partnering with different fintechs. By digitalising and automating processes, banks can reduce their operating costs and increase efficiency. Beyond that, banks have the opportunity to increase customer trust and loyalty through improved security measures and innovative services. For payment service providers PSD3 and PSR encourage competition and allow them to enter the market more easily. They have the chance to develop new technologies and services while meeting customer needs and gaining the trust of business partners. For e-money institutions PSD3 and PSR means that they are required to obtain a licence under the Payment Services Supervision Act (ZAG) and are therefore under the control of stricter regulations. In addition, the shifting of fraud losses from customers to banks increases the risk and poses a challenge for fraud management. For end users, the PSD3 and PSR directives enhance security through improved authentication processes. They benefit from increased transparency about fees and other costs, leading to better decision-making when choosing banks and payment providers.  Figure 2: Schedule of PSD3/PSR Implementation until 2026  The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is considered a highly influential EU regulation and aims to strengthen the digital resilience of the financial sector. DORA sets IT security standards, particularly in the areas of risk management for information and communication technology (ICT), the reporting of ICT incidents, and the monitoring of risks by third-party ICT service providers. The DORA regulation came into force on January 17, 2023, but will not be fully applied until January 17, 2025. In this 24-month transition period, banks and other financial institutions have time to prepare their businesses for the actual DORA enforcement by January 2025. Banks and payment service providers can improve the resilience of their systems and processes against cyber-attacks and other digital threats. By ensuring compliance with DORA regulations, banks and payment service providers can strengthen the trust of their customers and position themselves as trustworthy and reliable partners in the market. Improved risk management and emergency plans help banks to minimise potential financial damage. End users can rely on more secure and reliable financial services. Beyond that one can expect less downtime and fewer interruptions, allowing them to access their financial services continuously.  Figure 3: Management of third-party ICT risks with DORA   The Financial Data Access Regulation (FiDA) aims to create a unified âOpen Financeâ space across Europe. By giving authorised third-party providers access to financial data and offering innovative, customised financial products and services, the aim is to increase transparency, promote competition and give consumers more control over their financial data. The decision to implement FiDA is scheduled for the beginning of 2025. FiDA offers great opportunities for banks and payment service providers to strengthen their customer relationships by developing personalised products and services. Increased transparency will improve fraud management and claims processing. In addition, FiDA aims to promote cooperation between traditional financial institutions and new fintech companies to improve the service offering and reach new customer segments through strategic partnerships. End customers benefit from greater transparency, easier financial management, and personalised financial products such as embedded finance solutions. The implementation of FiDA presents a challenging task, particularly for banks and payment service providers. The preparation includes developing scalable and resilient interfaces for data transmission and creating a consent management dashboard. The potential entry of big tech into financial services adds competition to the market.  The Instant Payment Regulation (IPR) aims for real-time payments within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Adopted on March 13, 2024, the IPR requires that payment service providers facilitate instant payments by 2025, ensuring transactions are processed within seconds, 24/7, throughout the whole year. The regulation aligns with the European Commissionâs objective to enhance the efficiency, speed, and security of the payment system. For banks, instant payments offer the opportunity to work with real-time cash flow transparency and rely less on outdated forecasting methods. Corporates benefit from a better overview of funds, which can lead to more accurate decision-making and lower operating costs. The shift to real-time payments also comes with significant challenges. The speed of instant payments leaves little room for error or recovery, which makes transaction and data fraud easy. Processing transactions 24/7 demands significant investment in upgrades, including cloud-based solutions for scalability and sophisticated fraud detection mechanisms. Beyond that, payment service providers must comply with real-time sanctions screening and transaction monitoring. Meeting regulatory standards requires integrating advanced monitoring tools into payment systems. End users gain immediate access to funds, making financial management more flexible and convenient.  How can banks and payment service providers take advantage of the opportunities presented by these regulatory changes? Here is some key advice. Advanced authentication: implement secure and user-friendly authentication technologies; Fraud detection: integrate fraud detection and risk management systems, and train staff to identify suspicious transactions; ICT governance: adapt internal policies and processes for continuous risk assessment and management.  Technology investment: upgrade IT infrastructure and develop secure, real-time data sharing APIs; Scalable IT infrastructure: invest in scalable cloud solutions and advanced IT systems to handle high transaction volumes for instant payments.  Digital resilience testing: conduct annual baseline tests and threat-led penetration tests (TLPT); Incident management: develop an internal reporting system for ICT incidents and synchronise all ICT systems with a reliable reference time.  Fintech partnerships: form partnerships with fintech companies to expand service offerings and facilitate the transition to instant payments; Third-party risk management: review and update outsourcing policies and contracts, and conduct regular due diligence.   Banks and payment service providers need to act now in order to keep up with current trends to remain competitive in the payment market. This includes analysing current business processes, identifying gaps in terms of regulatory requirements and new customer expectations to effectively shape existing business models for the future. Moreover, banks and payment service providers should incorporate regulatory aspects into their business strategy and consider the selection and implementation of new technology solutions and suitable third-party providers.  In the next article of this three-part series, we will take a closer look at the increasing importance of cyber security in the payment industry. Why is it important to include a sophisticated cyber security strategy and what are the possible consequences of disregarding cyber risks in todayâs world?

    "news_title": "\r\n\tWhy banking's future depends on finding the Goldilocks Zone - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": " Many believe that humanityâs survival depends on our ability to get 'off planet' and find other habitable planets to colonise. Astronomers scan the universe, searching for signs of planets in the so-called 'Goldilocks Zone' where conditions are not too hot, not too cold, and where we could â interstellar travel permitting âÂ conceivably thrive. Like humanity, bankingâs long-term future is by no means secure. The industry still wrestles with seemingly intractable core challenges â inflexible mainframe legacy technology, configuration neo cores that are challenging to scale, and framework cores that are challenging to build and manage. While banks struggle to meet their goals because of these core compromises, the clock is ticking. AI is advancing at near-light speed, creating tremendous opportunities for banks while, at the same time, presenting existential risks. To survive amidst so much change and in a challenging environment, the banking industry needs to find its own Goldilocks Zone â a next-generation cloud-native core solution that is easy to build with and easy to scale, and at the same time reduces the complexity, cost, and risk of migration.  10x Banking recently commissionedindependent researchinto over 200 senior IT decision-makers in banking and financial services. 93% of our respondents agreed that their choice of core technology is critical to their future success. While there is much greater diversity of core solutions than were available a decade ago, the research shows that limitations and compromises remain. Over half (55%) of IT decision-makers we surveyed cited the limitations of their existing core solutions as one of the biggest roadblocks to the achievement of their business goals. Despite adopting neo-core solutions, many banks remain fundamentally tethered to their legacy IT systemsÂ â mainframe cores that have been the backbone of their operations for decades but are now an inflexible barrier to innovation. The first attempt to break free from these constraints came with the introduction of cloud-native technologies and neo-core solutions a decade ago. These new core banking systems promised to unlock accelerated innovation by enabling banks to migrate to the cloud, and rapidly respond to evolving customer expectations. However, the adoption of neo-core systems has proved to be sub-optimum. Banks have largely been limited to 'side-car' innovation â launching single cloud-native products here and there while still needing to retain and maintain their legacy mainframe cores. At the root of bankingâs dilemma is that, despite more cloud-native core options being available in the market, each choice demands that the bank make significant compromises. Neo core platforms, for example, can largely be classified into two categories â framework neo cores and configuration neo cores. This binary choice of neo core has created a fork in the transformation roadmap where banks have had to choose between either: Banks that want to build and launch innovative products quickly and deliver to the market at scale without incurring outsized costs and risk have had no choice but to compromise when it comes to their core solution. These core compromises can rapidly turn into frustrations â even business-critical risks â especially when it comes to the integration of new technology. Our research into IT decision-makers in banks and financial services found that the number one challenge banks face with their core technology is integrating key technology with their core solution. For example, while our research shows that AI remains front-of-mind and a leading driver of banksâ transformation plans, only one in three (32%) of respondents have so far integrated AI into their core solution.  Finding the Goldilocks Zone for banking requires next-generation core technology. A core that blends the customisation and scalability of framework neo cores with the accelerated innovation and time to market of configuration neo cores, while derisking migration by enabling co-existence with legacy systems. We call this next generation of core banking technology the âmeta coreâ. For banks to achieve full transformation and ensure long-term survival, a step-by-step approach is essential. The meta core offers a roadmap that derisks the transformation process while delivering the customisation and innovation required for success. By transitioning operations and products to the meta core, banks can reduce their reliance on legacy systems, lower costs, and improve customer experiences â all while maintaining stability and continuity. The meta core allows banks to take the 'giant leap' thatâs essential for their progress. It is a next-gen evolution of core technology that allows banks to keep pace with innovation in an AI-accelerated landscape.

    "news_title": "\r\n\tUncovering the untapped customer opportunity in eIDAS2 - ThePaypers\r\n",
    "news_content": "eIDAS2 is a billion-euro opportunity just waiting to be tappedâso why isn't everyone seeing it?  In a two-part series, digital identity expertJamie Smithexplains exactly why this is the case, giving us a fresh perspective on its massive potential.  Many experts are excited about the EUâs new digital identity framework and the innovative digital wallet approach for sharing personal data. They say itâs all about a new trusted digital ID, qualified electronic signatures, and login. Important stuff. But those things are only part of the story. Others closely involved with the regulations talk about e-Government. About the opportunity for advanced âtell me onceâ services. Where government digital platforms donât have to ask you again and again for the same data because another government department already has it. And some talk about the power of eIDAS2 as a move toward digital sovereignty. Towards personal agency and data portability. And the right to digital privacy and anti-surveillance. These things are also hugely important. But thereâs still something missing. Is it the role of eIDAS2 as a defence against bigtech in Europe? A response to the concentration of data power in the hands of only a few billionaires? A foil against Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon? Maybe. But again, these things are only part of the story. Because itâs about all this and something much more. Something hidden that most people canât see. To understand what Iâm talking about, we need to look at eIDAS differently. I donât mean the privacy story. Or the consent story. Or the identity story.  Letâs start by looking atcustomer messaging. Hereâs a short story to explain what I mean. I was recently sent an email by my savings bank. âWe have a message for youâ, it said. But of course, there was no message in the message. Why? Because banks donât use email to send customer messages. The compliance and fraud teams wonât let it happen. Fair point, I thought. I donât trust email either. The email asked me to head over to the bankâs website so that I could log in and read the important message there. Which I did, except it had been so long that Iâd forgotten my login details. Again. They asked for an account number and password that I didnât have handy. I was locked out. Once again,Password Reset Is The New Login. So, I requested an account reset. And guess what? They sent the instructions to my bloody email. You know, the one they didnât trust to send a message to. I opened the email and clicked on the link to reset my account. I was on my mobile device so the browser automatically bounced me to the phoneâs native app by default. But of course, my mobile app was out of date and needed an update. So, I headed to the AppStore and triggered the refresh. That took 3 more minutes to download. I finally opened the app, which needed to send me a one-time password (OTP) by SMS. That arrived 40 seconds later, I entered the OTP code and reset the account. Finally, I navigated to my âinboxââ¦ and read the Important Message. A pointless update to the privacy policy. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? 9 minutes of my life wasted. I could have spent that valuable time scrolling TikTok. And just for kicks, showing zero empathy for the customerâs emotional experience, the bank chose that exact moment to try and up-sell me another savings product. Iâm labouring this story for a reason. This is very clearly an awful experience. But how many times do you have to do this each week? Sometimes each day? Because itâs a familiar pattern with ALL your digital relationships. And on average, you have over 100 digital accounts to deal with. Some dead, some old, all previous, some current, few relevant. But all messy, clumsy and fragmented. And by the way, if you help manage a household, then you have on average ANOTHER FORTY digital relationships to look after. Employer. Car. Tax. Insurance. Pets. Health. Money 1. Money 2. Taxi. Deliveries. Netflix. Spotifyâ¦  Why is this all such a digital nightmare? Itâs simple. Because businesses only really have four ways to âengageâ us. The first two are PUSH: Message- send a crappy text, with maybe a reminder or a one-time-password; Email- send a more detailed message, perhaps with an attachment (woohoo). Both are about interruption and so customers put up barriers. Spam detection. Filters and folders. Rules to auto-ignore. The remaining two channels are PULL: Websites- ask the customer to come to your home page, fill out forms, and perhaps even log in (and we know how that goes); Apps- get the customer to download, or log in to, YET ANOTHER APP. I have so many of these now Iâm literally Googling myself on my phone to find the app I need. Thatâs it. Four channels.  Now, imagine you are in charge of customer engagement in a regulated business and youâre sending a message to 1.8 million customers about an update. What would YOU do? Hereâs where Iâm going with this. If you look closely, you might see that a digital wallet can become a new customer channel. More trusted than SMS. Less spammy than email. More portable than a mobile app. And more seamless than a website. Now, consider an actual customer journey. Letâs look at travel. Think about the average, typically complex end-to-end experience for a passenger on an overseas trip. Now think about how many digital tools they might use from the very start (looking at options of where to go and when, where to stay, and why), right through to the return leg and getting home, sorting the admin, and unpacking. Itâs very likely involved a mix of YouTube, TripAdvisor, SMS, Email, Messenger, WhatsApp, Websites, Instagram, Airbnb, Expedia, Booking, hotel and taxi portals, airline reservation systems, hotel guest apps, and more. The entire and ârealâ customer journey is a mess of steps, tools, data flows, forms, and apps. But now think about it from the hotelâs point of view. Receive booking by email. Take payment at reception. Issue door key. Check out. Thatâs the total view of the âend-to-endâ customer journey. Itâs narrow (only a few steps), and itâs shallow (with little information). And you know that itâs limited because when you walk into the hotel they ask âHave you stayed with us before, sir?â To which you say, âYes, I was here two weeks ago, but youâve already forgottenâ.  Now imagine the passenger had a digital wallet. From a data point of view, we can now âseeâ across the customer experience. The whole trip. All the ins and outs, joining the dots. We can see reusable customer data and identity information that can be shared and reshared by the guest, under their control. And from the businessâs perspective, they can, with permission, see a joined-up digital customer experience. Perhaps even open up new opportunities for digital services and revenue streams. Itâs potentially a whole new ecosystem of data and experiences but for the first time organised around the customer. In the 2nd post, weâll dig into what this could mean for businesses responding to eIDAS2.

    "news_content": "The Paypers (\"we\"; \"us\"), is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy governs the data which we collect from users and other third parties in the course of our business, as well as the way in which we protect and process such information. Please read this policy carefully to understand how we will treat your personal data.  For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\"), the data controller is The Paypers (Company registration 34345453), having its registered address at Prinsengracht 777e, 1017 JZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  Data regarding you and your business is collected, retained, and processed as subject to and in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR. We may collect personal data that includes: name, job title, contact information including email address and country of residence, employer details, IP address, other information relevant to customer surveys and/or others. We may collect and process the following data about you: (a) Information you provide when you use our website www.thepaypers.com (the \"website\"). This includes information provided by you at the time you download a report or register for one of our services. We may also ask you for information if you report a problem with our website. (b) If you contact us by email, through our contact form, by telephone, or in writing, we may keep a copy of that correspondence or communication. (c) Details of your visits to the website and the resources that you access. If you have provided us with the personal data of another person, you thus confirm that they consent to the processing of his/her personal data and that you have informed him/her of our identity as a data controller and provided him/her with a copy of this policy.  We may collect information about your mobile phone, computer, or other device from which you access the website. Such information may include your domain name and IP address, details of your computer operating system and browser, the website you visited prior to visiting our website and unique number identifiers that are automatically generated by our systems when you visit our website. This will include details of the choices you make on our website indicating whether you wish to receive information on other products and services. Some of this information is retained in the \"cookie\" files on your computer. These files retain useful information that can speed your navigation through frequently visited sites. They can also retain records that track site usage and preferences. These cookies can be disabled or deleted by activating the setting on your browser if you do not wish them to be used.

Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log in to our website. Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.  We can process personal data on various legal bases. For processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose, Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR is our legal basis. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as for example when processing operations are necessary to provide our service, the processing is based on Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, our processing is based on Article 6(1) (c) of the GDPR. Finally, we can base our processing operations on Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR: this legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by the above-mentioned legal grounds, if that processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.  We use the information collected about you for the following purposes:  We will not share your data with third parties for marketing purposes unless we have procured your express consent to do so.  We take appropriate measures to ensure that any information collected from you is kept only for so long as is necessary for the purpose for which such information is used. We normally update your personal data within seven (7) working days of any new or updated personal data being provided to us, to ensure that the personal data we hold about you is as accurate as possible. We protect your data by:   We may disclose your personal information to third parties: (a) In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. (b) If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held about our customers will be one of the transferred assets. (c) If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data to comply with any legal obligation. (e) If it is required to do so to deliver our services. We sometimes outsource certain functions of our business to service providers: some of these service providers may use cloud-based systems: in that case, your personal data would be hosted on their servers, but under our direction and control. (f) To protect the rights, property, or safety of The Paypers, our customers, or others. (g) Where we have received your permission for us to do so.  The GDPR gives you the right to access information held about you.
