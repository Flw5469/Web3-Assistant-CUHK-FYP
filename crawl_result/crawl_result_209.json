    "news_title": "Cardano Founder: New Collab to Propel BTC DeFi Beyond Solana, Ethereum",
    "news_content": "Cardano (ADA)has become the first Layer-1 blockchain to integrate BitcoinOS (BOS), enabling it to tap into Bitcoin’s vast capital pool of US$1.3T (AU$1.97T) without third-party intermediaries. The collaboration, led by EMURGO—Cardano’s Web3 development arm—and by BOS, brings Bitcoin’s scalability and programmability to Cardano’s decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The news comes a few days after CNA initiallyreportedon the collaboration. Related:Despite ‘Trump Trade’ Jitters, Analysts Say On-Chain Metrics Bullish for Bitcoin, Likely Providing ‘Tailwind for Market’ Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano, announced he’d relaunch the Bitcoin Education Project in 2025 now that the BitcoinOS has been integrated into Cardano. He added that the development “will dwarf anything Solana and Ethereum have done”. Now that Bitcoin's back in the family and innovating again, thanks to@BTC_OS, I will re-launch the Bitcoin Education Project in 2025 and produce a new edition of my course. We are also going to prepare Aiken education for Bitcoin developers, including hosting on… Going back to the partnership, a key aspect is the integration of BOS’s Grail bridge into Cardano’s framework. This bridge, built on BOS’s BitSNARK verification protocol, uses zero-knowledge technology to allow secure, trustless BTC transfers to Cardano. Through this setup, DeFi applications on Cardano, like Fluid Tokens, can now incorporate BTC functionality, expanding the windows of opportunities for users. EMURGO’s CEO, Ken Kodama, noted that the partnership will enhance Cardano’s cross-chain capabilities and provide its ecosystem with secure access to Bitcoin. This collaboration with BitcoinOS has the potential to unlock new cross-chain capabilities and further strengthen Cardano by granting Cardano users, projects, and developers secure, trustless access to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Supporting a more open and interconnected Web3 environment across different blockchains helps drive innovation and the adoption of DeFi and other decentralized solutions. Even after this news, theprice of ADAis still reluctant to move. Data shows ADA has continued to face price challenges, trading below US$0.34 (AU$0.52) after losing over 16% in the past month, despite occasional hints of recovery (but nothing ever happens).

Yet, ADA has only managed to increase by 14% year-to-date. José is a journalist and translator with a keen interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
