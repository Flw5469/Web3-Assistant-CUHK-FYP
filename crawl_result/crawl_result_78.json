    "news_title": "Crypto Enthusiasts Targeted in Multi-Vector Malware Attack Disguised As Python-Based Trading Tool: Report - The Daily Hodl",
    "news_content": "Malware disguised as a Python-based trading bot has reportedly targeted crypto traders in a multi-vector supply chain attack. According to a newblog postby cloud-based cybersecurity firm Checkmarx, crypto enthusiasts have been targeted by advanced malware cloaked as a suite of artificial intelligence (AI)-based crypto trading tools that aim to steal sensitive data and drain crypto wallets. Checkmarx says the malware was distributed through code-sharing platform GitHub and PyPi (Python Package Index), a centralized location for Python packages, and targeted both Windows and Mac operating systems. According to Checkmarx, the malware utilized deceptive graphical user interface to distract victims and a multi-stage infection process that led victims to a fake website. “The CryptoAITools malware employs a sophisticated multi-stage infection process, leveraging a fake website to deliver its secondary payloads… A unique aspect of this attack, compared to many malicious packages we have seen in the past, is that the CryptoAITools malware incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) as a key component of its social engineering strategy. This GUI appears the moment the second-stage malware is activated and presents itself as an ‘AI Bot Starter’ application. It is designed to distract users and collect sensitive information while the malware operates covertly.” The attacker also set up a Telegram channel masquerading as the product’s tech support, further tricking users with offers of free trials. “In the Telegram chat, the attacker employs various tactics to lure potential victims. They offer ‘bot support’ to establish credibility and trust. To entice users, they promote their GitHub repository as hosting their ‘most powerful bot,’ appealing to those seeking advanced trading tools. The attacker then proposes an attractive offer: a free trial period followed by a monthly subscription model, making the proposition seem both risk-free and professional.” Checkmarx says the malware had “severe” consequences on its victims, including the potential theft of their identities, browser data, sensitive computer files, and digital assets.
