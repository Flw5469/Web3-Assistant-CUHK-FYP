    "news_title": "Why New Crypto Lunex Network Will Outperform Cardano and Avalanche",
    "news_content": "SPONSORED POST* The bull market is so near one can taste it. Many analysts say it should be here already, and we are in the last days of ‘buying the dip’ opportunities before the bull market shoots all crypto prices skywards. All? Sadly, a few will be left behind. Old favorites Cardano and Avalanche may not benefit as much from a bull market as most. Fortunately, the new cryptoLunex Networkis here to provide massive gains, even if the bull market never arrives. Summary Crypto presales are where the smart money goes to get in on new crypto offers before they trade on the open markets. Lunex Network is a new crypto in presale, and the investors are rushing in. Lunex Network is a new hybrid crypto exchange that solves all the hassles crypto traders face today. Even though crypto trading has existed since 2010, the last 14 years have not perfected the system. Traders battle with limited trading pairs, low liquidity pools, security concerns, and a host of issues. No single exchange could give traders what they want. Lunex Network changes all that. Lunex network offers over 50,000 trading pairs in cross-chain trading, all on a zero-fee structure. A pool of pools ensures liquidity is not a problem, and non-custodial wallets lend unprecedented levels of security. Lunex Network is also a Defi crypto, demystifying the complexities of DeFi in a platform easy enough to understand for new traders yet advanced enough to appease professional traders. Cardano has been part of the crypto mythos since 2017. It is so ingrained in the cryptosphere that Cardano is not even seen as an altcoin but as part of the establishment. Sadly, Cardano has not been doing too well. Cardano peaked at $3.10 in 2021, had a sharp decline until the end of 2022, and has since been stable at the $0.30-$0.40 mark. Cardano has fallen out of favor with developers, and somehow, Cardano could not convince users to take it back to its glory days. Even in a bull market, the best Cardano will do is a 2x, which is too slow for the profits cryptos are famous for. Maybe it’s time for us to thank Cardano for its pioneering work and let it go to pasture. Avalanche’s trajectory is similar to Cardano’s. Avalanche peaked north of $140 in 2021 but hit $14.00 by June 2022, losing 90% of its value in 7 months. Avalanche investors were not impressed. While several other tokens bounced back after the crypto winter of 2022, Avalanche has remained well under the $20.00 mark for over a year. At the start of this year, Avalanche had a second wind, but nothing to give investors any confidence that Avalanche would do much, even in a bull market. It seems that Cardano and Avalanche had their day, and it’s time for investors to find a newcryptoto invest in. Lunex Network offers alluring possibilities, and as the token is in presale, it has the capacity to beat bear market blues but will perform even better in a bull market. Lunex Network is now available at $0.0017.
