As BlockDAG heads towards its goal, it stands out as the best crypto to mine this year.Bitcoin's Continued Rise in 2024Bitcoin's accumulation has hit high levels in 2024, with over 2.9 million BTC now in long-term hold addresses. These wallets, belonging to holders who haven't sold any Bitcoin, have doubled their stash in just ten months. This trend points to increasing trust in Bitcoin's long-term value as these holders keep adding despite market changes.(credit: PR)In January 2024, these addresses had 1.5 million BTC, and by year's end, they might control over 3 million BTC. This move has cut down selling pressure and could help stabilize Bitcoin's price. Currently, these addresses hold Bitcoin worth over $210 billion, boosting their role in the cryptocurrency world.Cardano (ADA) Experiences Ups and DownsCardano's (ADA) price has been quite shaky recently.
