    "news_content": "Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are digital currencies not backed by real assets or tangible securities. They are traded between consenting parties with no broker and tracked on digital ledgers. Any investor can purchase cryptocurrency from popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, apps such as Cash App, or through brokers. Another popular way to invest in cryptocurrencies is through financial derivatives, such as CME's Bitcoin futures, or through other instruments, such as Bitcoin trusts and Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin is the most well-known digital currency created in January 2009, after the concept was published in a white paper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large are touted to lower transaction fees when compared to traditional online payment methods, and unlike traditional government-issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized authority. Ethereum is a blockchain-based crypto platform that is best known for its digital currency called Ether, or ETH. Ethereum is second in market value only to Bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap data. While the maximum number of bitcoins in circulation is limited at 21 million, the amount of Ether that can be created is unlimited, which is one of the main differences that investors should know. One of the first steps to buying cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum or Bitcoin is to identify a platform for trading the digital currencies. Some of the top platforms including Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, Gemini, Binance, and Bitfinex, which all offer Ethereum to buy and sell. Ether is also backed by many Fortune 500 companies, spurring investor interest. Investors looking to add new cryptocurrencies to their portfolios often look for aninitial coin offering(ICO), the crypto variation on an initial public offering (IPO). Like an IPO, a company seeking to raise money can create a new coin or service to launch an ICO as a way to raise funds. Investors in turn can buy the initial coin offering to own the new token, but should be aware of potential fraud within the industry, which is monitored by the SEC for potential abuse. Investopedia / Alison Czinkota A cryptocurrency exchange traded fund is an ETF that tracks a single cryptocurrency or a basket of different digital currencies, and has similar benefits to a traditional ETF—including lower cost of ownership and greater diversification. The first cryptocurrency ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, started trading in October 2021. A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared and verified via a computer network. That database makes up the underlying infrastructure of cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, for a decentralized record of transactions. Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoin by using computers with specialized chips to solve complicated mathematical puzzles. The first so-called miner to solve the puzzle can earn bitcoin rewards by running such programs using systems that use massive amounts of electricity to mine the cryptocurrencies—a process that has come under criticism because the mining process is not considered environmentally friendly. Digital currency is a form of currency that is also popularly known as digital money, electronic money, electronic currency, or cybercash, because they only exist in electronic form, versus a physical form such as paper cash or metal coins. Altcoins generally speaking are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. They share characteristics with Bitcoin but are also different in terms of how they are created and verified. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin and Ether alone accounted for nearly two thirds of the total cryptocurrency market, with altcoins making up the rest. A hot wallet is a cryptocurrency storage application that is always connected to your computer and cryptocurrency network, and as such they tend to be more vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches and theft than so-called cold storage methods. Hot wallets are used to send and receive cryptocurrency, and manage tokens you possess. Hot wallets are linked with public and private keys that serve as security measures. Decentralized finance, also known as DeFi, uses new technology to remove third parties such as banks and other traditional financial institutions in financial transactions. By removing centralized control by banks and other institutions over money, financial products, and financial services, the new financial applications may lower related maintenance costs and fees charged by banks—and also increase the speed of such services. A virtual currency is a digital representation of value only available in electronic form, and is also known asdigital currency. Such cryptocurrencies can be issued by private organizations or companies and its benefits over hard currencies include fast transaction speeds and ease of use.",

    "news_title": "Stock Investing Essentials",
    "news_content": "Stocks represent ownership of a company. Stocks owned either directly or through a mutual fund or ETF, will likely form the majority of most investors’ portfolios. The most expensive publicly-traded share of stock of all time were the Class A shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), Warren Buffet’s conglomerate and holding company as of January 2022. They hit $487,675 per share on Jan 18, 2022.It’s important to remember that this does not mean it is the most valuable company by stock value. The value of a company’s stock, or “market capitalization,” is determined by multiplying the price of its shares by the number of its shares. As of early 2022, the all-time closing high of the Dow Jones is 36,799.65 points, which it reached on January 4, 2022. The index’s all-time intraday high was 36,952.65, reached on Jan 5, 2022. Unrealized gains or losses represent the amount you would gain or lose if you sold your investment, often a stock, at its current value. You “realize” these gains or losses when you actually sell the investment. When people talk about stocks, they are usually referring to common stock, which is stock that usually gives voting rights in shareholder votes. Preferred stock almost never confers voting rights, but if a company only has enough money to pay some of its dividends, it has to pay preferred stock dividends first. In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, preferred stockholders have priority over common stockholders on company assets. Cyclical stocks are those that tend to rise and fall with the broader economy, falling when the economy is doing poorly and rising when the economy is doing well. Non-cyclical, often also called defensive stocks, tend have steadier performance that do better when the economy is down are down but peak less high during boom years. Stock is a type of investment representing ownership of a business. A unit of stock is called a share. The S&P 500 is an index of the stocks of 500 large U.S. companies that make up about 80% of the U.S. stock by market capitalization. It is a benchmark for large-cap U.S. stocks and is often used as a proxy for the U.S. stock market as a whole. Cyclical stocks are stocks that tend to rise and fall in line with the broader economy. Cyclical stocks include those of technology, finance, and energy companies. This contrasts with defensive stocks which tense to have steadier returns, drop less when the economy falls, and rise less when it grows. Common stock is a security that represents partial ownership of a company. When people colloquially refer to “stock” this is what they mean. It contrasts with preferred stock, a type of security that has aspects of both bonds and stocks. Preferred stock is company stock that is issued at a fixed par value, similar to a bond, and that does not confer voting rights, but has priority over company earnings when allocating dividends and priority over common stock in bankruptcy proceedings. Preferred stock has characteristics of both common stock and bonds. It occupies an intermediate space between the two in terms of its risk and returns. Floating stock, is the number of shares of stock a company has that are actively being traded by the public. It is generally referred to as “float.” A secondary offering can refer to when a major investor sells their stock on the public market or when a company issues additional stock after its IPO. The former just puts more shares onto the market, while the latter creates more overall shares to raise additional funds for the company. A fractional share is ownership of a portion of a single share of stock. This allows investors to buy stocks even if the price of their individual shares is extremely high, such as is the case with companies like Berkshire Hathaway. Equity compensation is when employees of a company are paid stock, stock options, or a similar type of investment. By tying the employee’s compensation to the stock price, they are meant to encourage the employee to work to maximize shareholder value. A meme stock is broadly any stock that has gained substantial popularity and investment online through social media. The term was popularized after investment in retailer Gamestop was driven through popularity on the r/wallstreetbets subreddit. An IPO lock-up is a contractually specified period prohibiting large shareholders from selling their shares for a specified period of time after a company has its IPO. Lock-up periods are meant to stop major shareholders from selling large numbers of shares early on and pushing down the stock price early on.

    "news_title": "ETFs",
    "news_content": "ETFs are baskets of stocks or bonds that trade like regular stocks. They're usually passively managed, meaning they seek only to match the underlying benchmark index. A leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a security that uses financial derivatives and debt to boost the returns of an underlying benchmark index. So while a traditional ETF may track securities of an index on a 1:1 basis, a a leveraged ETF may target a higher mark for a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio. Many young or novice investors may have heard about exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds and are wondering which may be the better option. Here are some things to keep in mind when deciding between the two investing options. First, typical mutual funds are actively managed rather than passively tracking an index, which can be an advantage. Many mutual funds also may require a minimum investment, but many brokers now offer commission-free ETFs. Generally speaking, ETFs are more tax-efficient and more liquid than mutual funds, which is also something young investors should weigh. Exchange traded products are financial instruments that track a benchmark index or a basket of underlying securities that trade on exchanges similar to stocks and bonds that are bought and sold in the open market. Some popular ones include exchange traded notes, exchange traded funds, and other related products. A stock exchange traded fund is a financial product that tracks a basket of equities, which is an investing option that helps investors diversify their investments in a specific industry or set of companies, limiting the risk of investing in a single stock. Those funds also offer a more cost-effective way to get exposure to a selection of stocks that track a specific index, industry or category of equities. Similar to a stock ETF, a bond exchange traded fund is a financial product that tracks a basket of debt, which is an investing option that helps investors diversify their investments in a specific industry or set of companies, limiting the risk of investing in a single bond. They can mirror bond mutual funds that have a debt portfolio of various risk profiles, from safer U.S. Treasuries to higher yielding bonds of varying maturities and risk exposure. An inverse exchange traded fund is a derivative product that uses securities tied to a benchmark index to profit from a decline in value of the underlying index. Inverse ETFs are also known as short ETFs or bear ETFs since the strategy involved investing on market declines or short positions in order to profit from the strategy. Inverse ETFs typically have higher fees compared to traditional ETFs, and can lead to losses if investors calculate the market direction incorrectly. Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) track the price performance of cryptocurrencies by investing in a portfolio linked to their instruments. Like other such funds, crypto ETFs trade on regular stock exchanges, and investors can hold them in their standard brokerage accounts. An index ETF is a type of exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is designed to mirror a benchmark index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average or Nasdaq 100 that trade on an exchange. Index ETFs are popular because they offer a diversified portfolio for investors. A smart Beta ETF is a kind of exchange traded fund that follows an index, but it also considers alternative factors in choosing the stocks from the index that include companies that only have certain behaviors or metrics. For example, some of these ETFs may follow a stock index that contains only tech stocks, large companies, or mid-cap stocks. The original ticker symbol for the Nasdaq 100 Trust is known as QQQQ, an ETF that trades on the Nasdaq exchange. The ETF is known as \"cubes\" or quadruple-Qs\" and offers broad exposure to the tech sector by tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index. A regulated investment company can be any type of investment such as mutual funds, ETFs, and REITS. A so-called RIC must derive a minimum of 90% of its income from capital gains, interest, or dividends earned on investments. It was created in 2010 under the RIC Modernization Act to address changes in the mutual fund industry, when President Obama signed it into law. BlackRock, the world's largest asset management company, is the parent of iShares, which is one of the world's largest and well-known ETF providers, offering more than 800 products worldwide. Founded in 2000, iShares now manages over $2 trillion among its exchange-traded funds. A sector ETF is a financial product that invests in stocks and other securities of a very specific sector such as manufacturing, energy or technology stocks, which allows investors to bet on an entire industry without having risky exposure to a single company or several companies. Some other broad sector categories also may include industrials, utilities, or real estate. An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange traded fund (ETF). Large banks like Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) are among some of the most well-known authorized participants. A dividend ETF is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to invest in a basket of dividend-paying stocks, which is an income-investing strategy that provides income via stocks dividends.",

    "news_content": "Investing differs from trading in that investing is for the long-term, usually years or decades. Investing is one of the key strategies to building long-term wealth and financial security. Yes, manybrokerageshave no minimum account size and will offer zero-commission trading, allowing you to begin investing with even very small amounts. In fact, now with many brokers offering fractional shares, you can invest in stocks even if their share price is over $1000. While there are many ways to invest in stocks, one of the easiest and best ways for beginning investors to do so is to open up a retirement account with a discount broker. These accounts have tax advantages when saving for retirement and many different brokers have ones that cost little or even nothing to have. While you can’t invest with zero money, you can invest with very little. Many stock brokers offer accounts with no minimum balance and no trading commissions so almost any amount you add to your account can be used to invest. You should invest because investing allows your savings to go farther than they otherwise would. Simply holding your savings as cash means it will just sit and be slowly diluted by inflation, whereas even in the safest investments it will earn some money for you, building on itself. As soon as you can afford to. Because investment returns compound, that is, the money you earn from investing then earns money, the sooner you begin investing, the more time you give for this process to work. In the U.S. stock markets major exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq are open from 9:30 .a.m to 4.p.m Eastern Time. However, this varies around the world depending on what exchange you’re looking at and whether that day is a holiday. A bond is an investment representing part or all of a loan to a person, government, or other entity. Bonds are issued at a set par value, usually $1000 or $100, and their prices fluctuates based on interest rates and perceived credit-worthiness of the borrower. A bond’s yield is the investment return that an investor will gain from a bond, usually expressed as a percentage. This is the percent of the bond’s price that each set interest payment will be. Yields go up as a bond’s price goes down and vice versa because they are a percent of the bond’s value, therefore the higher the bond’s price, the lower a percentage of that value a set interest payment will be. Technical analysis is a form of stock analysis that involves looking at the price movements of stocks over time in order to predict where they will go. It attempts to find patterns in stock movements based on statistical trends such as the moving average of a stock or its trading volume. This contrasts with fundamental analysis which looks at the financial values of the business that issued the stock and economic conditions affecting the market and that business in order to assess where a stock’s price will go. A sector breakdown is a way to look at a portfolio by organizing it by which sector of the economy each stock is in. This allows an investor to, depending on their investing strategy, avoid stocks from companies in sectors they don’t believe to have strong prospects, focus on stocks from sectors they believe are in a good position for growth, or ensure their portfolio is diversified. Short term investments are investments that are designed to be held for a year or less or investments a company intends to sell within 12 months. They are also known as “marketable securities” or “temporary investments,” and can be easily sold for cash. An investment banker works for a bank that deals mostly with raising capital for large institutions such as governments and corporations. They also deal with corporate restructuring as well as corporate mergers & acquisition (M&A). Wall Street is a street in New York City which, due to having been a historical center of the U.S. financial industry, is used as a term to refer to that industry as a whole. It is often contrasted to Main Street, which is used as a term to represent the broader economy outside the financial industry, especially small businesses.",

    "news_title": "Introduction to Investing in Bonds",
    "news_content": "Bonds are lower-risk and lower-return investments than stocks, which makes them an essential component of a balanced investment portfolio, especially for older or more conservative investors. Treasury bonds, notes, and bills are all fixed-income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. The primary difference between them is their maturity dates and the frequency of interest payments. Treasury bills have the shortest maturities, ranging from four weeks to one year, and they only pay interest when they mature. Treasury notes are issued with maturities ranging from two to 10 years, and pay interest every six months. And Treasury bonds mature in either 20 or 30 years, also paying interest every six months. An inverted yield curve is widely considered one of the most reliable indicators of an impending recession. An inverted yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession since 1955 with only one false alarm. Though the inverted yield curve observed in 2019, which preceded the short recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, should hardly be interpreted as a predictor of that recession. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices because the bond’s coupon rate is fixed but the appeal of that bond and its coupon rate on the secondary market changes with economic conditions. If interest rates rise, bonds issued with lower coupon rates become less attractive to potential buyers, who could get a higher rate of return on a new bond. Subsequently, the bond’s price declines. An investor who buys that bond at a discount will receive coupon payments on the bond’s face value, not its market value, meaning their return will be greater than the official coupon rate. Yields decrease as bond prices rise for the same reason. You can cash in most paper U.S. Savings Bond at a bank or credit union. The exception is Series HH bonds, which were discontinued in 2004. These need to be mailed to Treasury Retail Securities Services with a specific form. Electronic bonds can be cashed in online at Treasury Direct, which will transfer the proceeds to your checking or savings account within a couple of days. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are U.S. Treasury securities that are pegged to inflation. They are meant to preserve the purchasing power of the investor’s principal. A basis point is a unit of measurement for interest rates and other percentages in finance. One basis point is equal to 1/100th of a percent, or 0.01%. A repurchase agreement (repo) is a short-term borrowing arrangement in which a dealer sells government securities to investors with the guarantee they will buy them back shortly after (usually the next day) at a slightly higher price. A yield curve is a line connecting the yields on bonds of equal credit quality but different maturities as plotted on a graph. The slope of the yield curve signals expectations of future interest rates and economic activity. A normal yield curve slopes upward since bonds with longer maturities usually have higher yields. When the yields on short-term bonds exceed those on long-term debt, the yield curve is said to be inverted. A debenture is an unsecured loan certificate representing debt that is backed by creditworthiness rather than assets.",

    "news_title": "Options & Derivatives Trading",
    "news_content": "Yes, the simplest derivative investment allows individuals to buy or sell what is known as an option on a security. An option is a contract to buy or sell a specific financial product. Various derivative instruments besides options include swaps, futures, and forward contracts. The investor does not own the underlying asset, but they hope to profit by making bets on the direction of price movements spelled out in the contract. Simply put, ETF futures and options are derivative instruments tied to exchange traded funds. Futures represent an agreement to buy or sell shares of an underlying ETF at an agreed-upon price on or before a certain date in the future. Options, in contrast, give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to trade the underlying ETF shares at an agreed-upon price on or before a specified date in the future. The actual size of the derivatives market depends on what a person considers part of the market and so estimates vary widely. The entire derivatives market is, simply put, huge, and top estimates can be more than $1 quadrillion on the high end, based on what is included as a derivative. The larger estimates come from adding up the notional value of all available derivatives contracts. For example, the overall derivatives markets include products including options, warrants, swaps, credit default swaps, futures contracts, and forward contracts, as just a handful of examples. Some analysts argue that such a calculation doesn't reflect reality, in that the notional value of a derivative contract's underlying assets does not represent the actual market value. A forward contract is a derivatives instrument that is one of the oldest and most common types of derivative securities, in which counterparties agree to buy (receive) or sell (deliver) an asset at a specified price on a future date. They are used as a form of risk management, in that a forward contract can be used for hedging or speculation. They are quite common in foreign exchange markets as a way for investors to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities from various global currency markets. ETF futures are a kind of financial derivatives product built on existing exchange traded funds. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell shares of an underlying ETF at an agreed-upon price on or before a specified date. The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (FAMC) is commonly referred to as Farmer Mac, and was by an act of Congress in 1987 in response to the farm crisis in the United States, which led to thousands of farmers to default on their loans, lose their farms and led to the collapse of many agricultural banks that services the farming industry. The Cboe Options Exchange is the world's largest options exchange that was founded in 1973. It was originally known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the exchange changed its name in 2017 as part of a rebranding effort by its holding company, CBOE Global Markets, which runs the exchange with contracts focusing on individual equities, indexes, and interest rates. Warrants are similar to options, except that they are issued by a company and dilute overall equity ownership. Warrant coverage is an agreement between a company and shareholders in which the company issues a warrant that is worth some percentage of the dollar amount of their investment. Warrants, also like options, allow investors to acquire shares at an agreed-upon price. A warrant premium is the difference between the traded price of a warrant and its minimum value. A warrant's minimum value is the difference between its exercise price and the current traded price of its underlying stock. A weather derivative is a financial product that companies or investors can use to hedge risk against weather-related disasters, much like insurance. The seller of a weather derivative agrees to bear the risk of disasters in return for a premium for taking on that risk. If nothing happens before the agreed-upon contract, the seller will profit, but in the event of a weather phenomenon or disaster, the buyer of the derivatives contract will claim the set amount. Various industries such as agriculture or tourism and travel will use these financial products to offset any potential losses from unexpected weather disrupting business. Freight derivatives are financial products that derive their value from various freight agreements and freight rates, such as dry bulk carrying rates, and is used primarily in the shipping and cargo industry to manage the risk of fluctuating levels of freight charges or oil tanker rates changing unexpectedly. The risk management tool has become more in focus as the shipping industry bears the burden of supply-chain shocks and delays as a result of the global pandemic. Transaction risk is the risk that an investor or company may take on when currency exchange rate fluctuations may change the value of a foreign transaction after a transaction has been completed but not yet settled, and can also be referred to as exchange rate, or currency risk. Transaction risk takes on greater risk when there is a longer time between when the transaction occurs and when it settles. A cashless conversion is when the ownership of some kind of security or asset changes without cash payment by the owner. For example such a conversation may take place if convertible bonds or convertible preferred shares are part of a transaction in which there is a cashless conversion to common stock in the deal. A cashless conversion is typically spelled out in the contract when the deal occurs, and the transfer may happen by an agreed upon trigger event or specific date.",

    "news_title": "Commodities - Trading and Investing",
    "news_content": "Commodities are basic goods interchangeable between producers, such as grains, gold, beef, oil, and natural gas. As an asset class, they are highly speculative and are especially sensitive to economic shifts. A commodity is a basic good that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. They are often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services and while the quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, it is essentially uniform across producers. Commodities—precious metals, agriculture goods, and oil & gas—have often been positioned as hedges against inflation. However, commodities tend to respond to changes in the dollar's relative strength in international markets rather than domestic inflation pressures. Commodities work differently in spot markets and derivatives markets. In spot markets, the buyers and sellers exchange cash for immediate delivery of the commodity. In derivatives markets, the buyers and sellers exchange cash for the right to future delivery of that commodity. Derivatives holders will often roll over or close out their positions before delivery can happen since they aren’t necessarily looking to hold the commodity, but just speculate on its value. The automobile industry is one of the largest consumers of the world's raw materials. Some of the most common materials that industry relies on include aluminum, glass, and the iron ore to make steel, as well as petroleum products used to make plastics, rubber, and other special fibers. The spread between the cost of a raw commodity and the income it generates once sold as a finished product is known as the gross processing margin. It is affected by supply and demand. In the U.S., mineral rights are legally distinct from surface rights. Mineral rights are the ownership rights to underground resources such as fossil fuels, metals and ores, and mineable rocks such as limestone and salt. While not exclusively used in the context of commodities, “hoarding” often refers to the purchase and warehousing of large quantities of a commodity by a speculator with the intent of benefiting from future price increases. Hotelling's Theory defines the price or yield at which the owner of a nonrenewable resource will extract it and sell it, rather than leave it and wait. Specifically, it suggests that that price will be above that which safe interest-paying securities such as U.S. Treasury Bonds will pay. A commodity exchange traded fund (ETF) tracks the prices of a commodity or that commodity's corresponding index. There are commodity ETFs that can be used to gain exposure to many popular types of commodities including gold, silver, oil, and natural gas. The S&P GSCI is a benchmark commodities index that tracks the performance of the global commodities market and is made up of 24 exchange-traded futures contracts that cover commodities spanning five sectors.",

    "news_content": "From online brokerages increasing the ease of trading to mobile banking lowering the barriers for consumers to have access to the banking system, fintech has brought many advantages for consumers. Fintech is a portmanteau of the words “financial” and “technology,” and refers to technologies used in the financial sector of the economy. This includes things such as online banking apps, online stock brokerages, and mobile payment apps. Moore’s law is a name given to a prediction by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors that could be put on a computer chip would roughly double every 2 years. This trend held true for several decades after it was made in the 1960’s, and the exponential increase in transistor density has continued, albeit, not at the same rate. Quantum computing is a field of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to change the way computers store and process information. Specifically, instead of data being stored as bits, which are individual units of binary code, they would be stored as Qubits (a portmanteau of “quantum” and “bits”). Qubits would be able to be in a quantum superposition of being both 0 or 1, which would allow significantly great processing capability. Open banking, is a practice that involves the sharing of financial data between financial service providers through the use ofapplication programming interfaces (APIs). This practice could potentially open up new options to consumers and/or significantly compromise individuals' data security and privacy. Cost per click (CPC) is a model that some websites use to bill advertisers who advertise on their sites. It charges advertisers a certain amount, the aforementioned CPC, per time a visitor to the website clicks on the ad displayed there. Some sites use a different model which charges advertisers per certain number of people, usually 1000, who see an ad. That model is called “cost per mile.” Mobile commerce, also known as m-commerce, is the use of smartphones, cell phones, and similar mobile devices to make commercial transactions. This can include purchasing items or paying bills. Insurtech is a portmanteau of “insurance” and “technology,” and refers to the technology used by the insurance industry. Examples include mobile apps through which people can purchase insurance. A quick response (QR) code is a kind of barcode that can be read easily by a computer. It stores information in a square-shaped grid, rather than a series of lines like a conventional barcode. Material requirements planning (MRP) is an inventory management system that uses software to keep track of and manage a business’s inventory and supply chain. It requires significant initial costs and high-quality data, but can increase supply chain efficiency if those requirements are met. Mobile banking is when banking services are used via mobile devices such as smartphones. GPUs are a particular type of computer chip that is specialized at creating computer graphics. They were traditionally used to allow computers to play games and do 3D art and design. However, the kind of mathematics involved in computer graphics is of a similar type to the kind used to mind Bitcoin and train AIs, so the demand for GPUs has risen substantially in recent years as new uses have emerged.",

    "news_content": "Get expert advice on finding the right broker, learn to trade stocks, and understand how to evaluate the markets. If you're looking to invest and trade stocks for the long term, then one of thebest online brokersis all you need. But if you're looking to day trade, you'll want to do your research and find a platform that fits your trading style best. Investopedia identified 26 trading platforms and then collected over 2,300 data points to determine which are the best for day traders. Thebest day trading platformsthat made our list provide excellent apps for analyzing indicators and executing trades on a variety of securities including stocks, cryptocurrency, options, forex, futures, and more. Our editors independently research and recommend the best products and services. You can learn more about ourindependent review processand partners in ouradvertiser disclosure. We may receive commissions on purchases made from our chosen links. Investing takes a long-term approach to the markets, while trading involves short-term strategies to maximize returns daily, monthly, or quarterly. Investors are more likely to ride out short-term losses, while traders will make transactions that can help them profit quickly from fluctuating markets. How much money you need to begin trading depends on the type of securities you want to buy. Stocks typically trade in round lots,or orders of at least 100 shares. To buy a stock priced at $60 pershare, you will need $6,000 in your account. A broker may let you borrow half of that money, but you still need to produce the other $3,000. To trade options and futures, those trade by the contract. A contract represents some unit of the underlying security. In the options market, one contract is good for 100 shares of the stock.   Results vary widely depending on various trading strategies,risk managementpractices, and amounts of capital available for day trading. According to University of California researchers Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, they found that many individual investors hold undiversified portfolios and trade actively, speculatively, and to their own detriment.1 Day traders also can be hit with highbrokerage feesand other charges that cut into their profits.   The prices of shares on a stock market can be set in a number of ways. The most common way is through anauctionprocess where buyers and sellers place bids and offers to buy or sell. A bid is the price at which somebody wishes to buy, and an offer (or ask) is the price at which somebody wishes to sell. When the bid and ask coincide, a trade is made. Options allow for potential profit during both volatile times, which is possible because the prices of assets like stocks, currencies, and commodities are always moving. No matter what the market conditions are there is anoptions strategythat can take advantage of those conditions to profit, while taking on the risk of losing money as well. A penny stock refers to a small company's stock that typically trades for less than $5 per share. Although some penny stocks trade on large exchanges such as the NYSE, most penny stocks trade over the counter through the OTC Bulletin Board. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is a real-time market index representing the market’s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Investors use the VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. A price target is an analyst's projection of a security's future price, one at which an analyst believes a stock is fairly valued. A short position is a trading technique used by investors who anticipate a security will fall in price. In common practice, short sellers borrow shares of stock from an investment bank or other financial institution, paying a fee to borrow the shares while the short position is in place. A paper trade is a simulated trade that allows an investor to practice buying and selling without risking real money. The term paper trade dates back to a time when aspiring traders practiced trading on paper before risking money in live markets—well before online trading platforms became the norm. Stop-loss orders are orders with instructions to close out a position by buying or selling a security at the market when it reaches a certain price known as the stop price. A stop-loss order is a type of order used by traders to limit their loss or lock in a profit on an existing position. Technical analysis is the study of historical market data, including price and volume. Using insights from market psychology, behavioral economics, and quantitative analysis, technical analysts aim to use past performance to predict future market behavior. The two most common forms of technical analysis are chart patterns and technical (statistical) indicators. The foreign exchange market, commonly referred to as the Forex or FX, is the global marketplace for the trading of one nation's currency for another. The forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world, with trillions of dollars changing hands every day. It has no centralized location, and no government authority oversees it.",

    "news_content": "From beginners to advanced traders looking for options trading, international exposure, and alternative investments, there is a brokerage firm for every investor across all levels of experience, income, and risk tolerance. Learn how brokers work and which ones are the best for you. Investopedia / Alice Morgan Investopedia’s experts put 26 companies through a rigorous evaluation process to identify the best online brokerages for you. We collected over 2,314 data points and used our subject matter expertise to develop a process for finding the best brokers, focusing on costs, range of offerings, trading technology, and more. Brokerage accounts are not FDIC-insured like deposit accounts at banks. Instead, the money you have in a brokerage account may be insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). The SIPC doesn't insure you against losses resulting from market activity or fraud. The SIPC will reimburse investors for up to $500,000, including $250,000 in cash, in the event of a firm's insolvency. The SIPC only covers member firms. Yes. Because minors are not eligible to open their own brokerage account, parents and guardians can open and manage a custodial account in a child's name. Funding options for custodial accounts include cash, stocks, and mutual fund transfers. The process of opening a custodial account involves providing personal and banking information and completing a series of forms online. Find the best brokerage firm and account that satisfies your investing style and needs. Then evaluate how a brokerage can help you manage risk. Apply for and set up the account and then fund the account. Before investing your money in the brokerage account, consider educating yourself about how stocks and other investments work (remember, investing always comes with the risk of losing your principal deposit). Brokerage cash is a top-line cash total in your investing account. It's the cash amount before stripping out items like unsettled trades and collateral. Not all of your brokerage cash is immediately available for trading or withdrawing. That would be a bottom-line number which may be called buying power, cash available for withdrawal, or something similar. Cash in these accounts can be parked to collect interest, reinvested, or withdrawn for paying bills. Brokerage accounts are taxable investment accounts through which you can buy and sell stocks and other securities. IRAs are designed for retirement savers and allow tax-free or tax-deferred growth on the investments you hold in the account. Unlike brokerage accounts, IRAs have strict contribution limits, and withdrawals may trigger a penalty. Brokerage accounts and IRAs are taxed differently, which can be a deciding factor when choosing an account. A brokerage fee is a fee a broker charges to execute transactions or provide services for clients. Brokerage fees are based on a percentage of the transaction, as a flat fee, or as a hybrid of the two, and vary according to the industry and type of broker. A cross is when a broker receives a buy and sell order for the same stock at the same price, and subsequently makes a simultaneous trade between two separate customers at that price. Variations of this are the market opening and market closing crosses Best execution is a legal mandate that requires brokers to seek the most favorable options to execute their clients' orders within the prevailing market environment. Best execution is a significant investor protection requirement that obligates a broker to exercise reasonable care when executing an order to obtain the most advantageous terms for the customer. It requires brokers to examine, track, and document when routing an equity investment, an option, or a bond order for execution. Payment for order flow (PFOF) is the compensation a broker receives for routing trades to execute to a particular market maker. The buy side is a segment of financial markets made up of investing institutions that buy securities for money-management purposes. A business involved in buy-side activities will purchase stocks, bonds, and other financial products based on the needs and strategy of their company's or client's portfolio. Common buy-side institutions include hedge funds, pension funds, and mutual funds. A deep discount broker is an agent who mediates trades on exchanges between securities buyers and sellers at even lower commission rates than those offered by a traditionaldiscount broker. The sell side is the part of the financial industry that is involved with the creation, promotion, and sale of stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, and other financial instruments to the public market. The sell side can also include private capital market instruments such as private placements of debt and equity. A joint brokerage account is a type of investment account owned by two or more people. It allows multiple individuals to contribute funds towardinvestmentsand maketradingdecisions together. Joint brokerage accounts are commonly opened by married couples, siblings, or business partners who want to invest together and pool their resources. Soft dollars are a means of paying brokerage firms for their services through commission revenue, as opposed to through hard-dollar direct payments. A trailing commission is a fee you pay a financial advisor each year that you own an investment. The purpose of a trailing commission is to give an advisor an incentive to review a client'sholdingsand provide advice. It is essentially a reward for keeping you with a particular fund. Hard dollars are cash fees or payments made by an investor or customer to a brokerage firm in return for their services. Hard dollar payments are usually set amounts that are known before a customer begins dealing with a broker. Hard dollar payments include set transaction charges, monthly account maintenance charges, as well as paying for research provided by the brokerage firm.",

    "news_title": "Fundamental Analysis",
    "news_content": "Fundamental analysis is one of the cornerstones of investing, and gives you tools to help determine the value of different investments. From SWOT analysis to PE ratios, learn the tools of fundamental analysis here. Quantitative fundamental analysis analyzes an investment according to easily measured factors, such as the earnings or assets of the company that issued a stock. Qualitative analysis looks at harder to measure factors such as the quality of a company’s management or the strength of its brand. There is not a hard line between the two and some factors can fall into both categories. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. Financial statements contain many of the key metrics that help investors determine if a company is undervalued or overpriced. Financial statements have a company’s level of profitability, how much it holds in different types of assets, as well as how fast its sales and profits have grown over time. All of these figures are core parts of determining if a company is properly valued. There is no one answer to this question as different companies will naturally have different PE ratios. For example, mature companies in defensive stock sectors generally have low PE ratios, while early stage companies or companies in fast-growing sectors often have very high PE ratios. To make the most of PE ratio as a metric of company value, make sure to compare PE ratios to similar companies in similar sectors, as well as to the same company at different periods in the past to get better comparisons. SWOT analysis is a qualitative analysis method for analyzing a company’s competitive position.

    "news_content": "Learn all there is to know about savings accounts from regular passbook to high yield to HSAs. Discover where to get the best interest rates, how they are taxed, and how a savings club works. A savings account is considered high-yield if it pays more than a financial institution’s regular demand deposit or passbook savings accounts.  High yield savings accounts are typically money market savings accounts that are limited to six withdrawal transactions per month. Interest earned on savings accounts is reported to the IRS by commercial banks and other financial institutions and therefore is subject to federal income tax as regular income. Interest is reported on Form 1099 to bank customers, typically in January each year for the previous tax year. Both savings accounts and Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars by individual investors. However, unlike savings accounts, any capital appreciation earned with a Roth IRA is not subject to federal income tax. Growth in savings accounts, in the form of interest, is subject to taxation. Simple interest for a savings account is calculated by multiplying the account balance by the stated interest rate and then multiplying by the time period the money is in the account. Interest = Principal amount X Interest Rate X Time Period. A savings account is different from a checking account in that it is meant for accumulation of funds and earning interest rather than being a transaction account accessible with checks and debit cards. Savings accounts can be freely accessed by the account holder through deposits and withdrawals on demand and generally pay higher interest than checking accounts but are not designed for payment transactions. A savings account is a deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution that pays interest on the balance held in the account. Interest rates are typically modest but these accounts provide safety for emergency funds and savings needed for long-term needs. The deposit interest rate is the rate paid by banks and other financial institutions to deposit account customers in exchange for the use of their deposits to make loans. Deposit accounts include passbook savings, high-yield savings accounts, and certificates of deposit accounts. A sweep account is a specialized account that is often attached to a brokerage account to automatically transfer or sweep cash funds into a low-risk, higher interest-earning investment such as a money market fund at the close of each business day. A passbook loan is a loan made to a savings account owner or depositor by the bank holding the funds. The savings account balances serve as collateral for the personal loan, which is also called a pledged asset loan. A linked savings account is a deposit account connected to another account such as a checking or brokerage account. Linked savings accounts are usually held by the same financial institution as the customer's other accounts, facilitating efficient and timely transfer of funds between accounts. A joint account is a type of deposit account that is held by two or more people, often spouses. Joint accounts are generally checking or savings accounts where both parties can make account transactions like deposits and withdrawals individually.",

    "news_title": "Banking: Maximizing Today's Banking Options",
    "news_content": "Banking in the 21st century means being able to conduct all transactions digitally without needing to physically visit a branch location. Deposits, withdrawals, payments, and transfers can be conducted online or by phone app as well as applications for credit cards and loans. Banks are a very important part of the economy because they provide vital services for both consumers and businesses. Banks provide a secure way to store, protect and provide access to customer deposits. Consumers can conduct routine banking transactions through checking accounts, ATMs and electronic transfers while earning interest on their deposits held in deposit accounts like savings, certificates of deposits and in certain demand deposit accounts. The federal government began offering insurance on bank deposits in March 1933 through the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) after more than 9,000 banks failed as a result of the great depression. The FDIC is an independent agency that was created to boost confidence in the health and well-being of the national financial system and currently offers $250,000 of coverage per customer, per account. Larger banks can provide relatively more financial stability compared to smaller financial institutions like state and community banks and other financial institutions. While the U.S. banking system is very strong, including at the state and community level, larger banks are usually nationally chartered commercial banks that are guaranteed to provide FDIC insurance on deposits and are less likely to default on their obligations due to federally mandated capital reserve requirements. A national bank is a commercial bank that is chartered by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency and functions as a member bank of the Federal Reserve, as well as being an investing member of its district Federal Reserve Bank. National banks are required to be members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and provide deposit insurance coverage to their customers. Bank fees are charges levied by banks and other financial institutions on their personal and business customers for things like account set-up, maintenance, and transactional services. Other examples of bank fees are wire transfer fees, automated teller machine (ATM) fees, non-sufficient fund (NSF) fees, and late payment charges. A deposit with a bank refers to money held by the financial institution in a customer account. Deposits are held by banks for safekeeping and typically earn interest depending on the type of account. A checking account is a type of bank account held at a financial institution that permits withdrawals and deposits on a daily transactional basis. Checking accounts are also known as demand deposit accounts because they are highly liquid and can be accessed by writing checks, withdrawing or depositing funds with automated teller machines, and by debit card transactions. A personal loan is the process of borrowing a sum of money for personal use and is generally unsecured by collateral. Personal loans are typically used to pay off credit card debt, purchase big ticket items or fund large expenses like vacations or weddings. Personal loans can be offered by banks, credit unions, or online lenders and involve a set repayment term and either fixed or variable interest along with possible loan fees. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent federal agency insuring deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts to protect customers from bank failures. The FDIC was created during the great depression to maintain public confidence and provide stability to the financial system through the promotion of sound banking practices. The FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor for customers of member banks. A bank statement is a document sent from a financial institution to an account holder, either by mail or delivered electronically, that details monthly account activity, showing the account number and all the transactions in sequential order processed during the previous account cycle. Underbanked refers to people or segments of society who may have an account with a financial institution but choose to rely on very expensive non-bank sources of financial services such as wire-transfer or check-cashing services, title loans and payday loans instead of more traditional sources of retail banking services like debit and credit cards, demand deposit accounts and personal loans to meet their daily financial needs. This may be due to lack of access due to lower credit scores, not having banks near their residences, limited financial literacy or distrust of traditional financial services.",

    "news_title": "Money Market Account: What You Should Know",
    "news_content": "Money market funds, distinct from money market deposit accounts, are a type of mutual fund that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulations were significantly updated in 2016 that notably include establishing a floating net asset value (NAV) for funds vs. the previous fixed net asset value of $1 per share. Money market savings accounts are deposit accounts rather than transaction accounts, though they do allow up to six withdrawals per month. Money market savings and checking accounts both pay variable interest. Money market checking accounts, also called high-yield checking accounts, have minimum checking transaction and direct deposit requirements, unlike money market savings accounts. Money market accounts are often confused with money market funds, which are a type of mutual fund. Other misconceptions include that money market accounts protect deposits from inflation, which they do not, and deposits are protected from bank failure regardless of amount. As with other types of deposits, money market accounts are only protected up to $250,000 per account. Money market funds are a type of mutual fund. Some types of money market funds include U.S. treasury funds, U.S. Government and Agency funds and tax-free municipal money funds. Another type of money fund is a diversified taxable money fund that invests in such things as commercial paper and repurchase agreements offered by U.S. and foreign corporations. Money market savings and checking accounts, such as those offered by commercial banks, are safe as they are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000 per account.  Money market funds are mutual funds and as such are not insured by the FDIC.  Most, however, invest in U.S. government securities and are therefore backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. A money market account is a type of interest-bearing deposit account offered by financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. Money market accounts generally pay higher interest than a traditional passbook savings account and can be accessed, on a limited basis, through checks and debit cards. Money market yield refers to the rate of return delivered to investors in money market securities, which are highly liquid financial investment securities, rather than interest earned on a money market account. The money market yield can be calculated by taking the yield for the holding period of the security and multiplying by a 360-day bank year divided by the number of days until maturity. A retirement money market account is a money market account held within an individual IRA or 401K retirement account. Since this type of money market account is within a tax-deferred account the yield from its investments in money market securities like U.S. treasury securities, is not subject to taxation until the account owner withdraws the funds. Hot money refers to the velocity of currency moves between financial markets across the world.  These types of money transfers are motivated by investors seeking the highest interest on highly liquid money market securities and deposit instruments. As such, hot money flows from countries and banks offering the highest levels of interest on short term money-based securities. The term “Breaking the buck” refers to what happens when the net asset value (NAV) of a money market fund falls below $1. This can be caused by the money market fund's investment income not offsetting operating expenses or investment losses. This normally occurs when interest rates drop to very low levels, or the fund takes on greater investment risk and incurs unexpected losses.",

    "news_title": "Certificates of Deposit (CDs)",
    "news_content": "Learn all about various types of certificates of deposit, how they work and how they potentially fit into your savings and investment planning. Browse Investopedia’s expert-written library to learn more. CDs, along with other types of deposit products, do not build credit.  Only borrowing money through some type of loan from a financial services lender that reports to credit bureaus, like with a car loan, personal loan or credit card, can build a credit history. Yes, CDs are different from U.S. savings bonds in that CDs are a deposit account that have a fixed term held with commercial banks and U.S. savings bonds are debt obligations of the United States federal government. U.S. savings bonds also offer fixed terms that pay interest at maturity but provide longer term options compared to traditional CDs. Investable funds can be deposited in certificate of deposit instruments of various terms with commercial banks, where they will earn fixed or variable interest that is payable at maturity. Certificates of deposit typically pay higher interest than money market savings accounts due to the fact that they are less liquid and involve a penalty for early withdrawal. Money market savings accounts allow for limited withdrawals but do not have a maturity date or early withdrawal penalty involved. The better option depends on whether yield maximization or flexibility is more important to your financial needs. A fixed rate certificate of deposit is a CD that has a set or fixed interest rate that is paid over the entire term of the instrument. The total fixed interest earned along with the CD principal is paid to the investor once the certificate of deposit reaches maturity. Variable rate CDs are deposit instruments that have a fixed term but pay a variable rate of interest over the term of the instrument that can be based on an index like the prime rate. Upon maturity the principal and variable interest earned are paid to the depositor. A jumbo certificate of deposit is a CD that has a larger minimum deposit, which is $100,000, compared to regular CDs. Traditional certificates of deposit typically have a minimum deposit of $2,500. As with traditional certificates of deposit, interest earned is paid at maturity along with return of the principal. An add-on CD is a type of certificate deposit that allows for additional deposits to be made before maturity of the instrument. Most CDs do not allow additional deposits to be made, however, and require a lump sum deposit at the beginning of the CD term. Add-on CDs typically pay lower interest compared to traditional CDs in exchange for the flexibility that they offer. A CD ladder is when a depositor spreads their deposits over number of certificates of deposit across multiple maturity periods, with each successively longer maturity term representing the ascending rungs of a ladder. Using this approach reduces the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations over time by allowing the depositor to continually roll over shorter term CDs and reinvest longer term CDs as they reach maturity in order to optimize yield. Uninsured certificates of deposit are CDs that are not covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Association (NCUA).  These types of CDs pay higher interest rates to investors due to the higher risk they present.  Uninsured CDs are offered by investment firms and foreign banks that are not eligible for insurance coverage. Brokered CDs are offered to investors through investment firms and are technically not insured by the FDIC. However, the savings held by the investment firm with a commercial bank, from which the brokered CDs are created, are insured, which offers investors a degree of protection. Brokered CDs offer investors more flexibility and higher yields vs. traditional certificates of deposit but also present higher risk. A liquid certificate of deposit is a type of CD that allows the investor to make withdrawals before the CD reaches maturity without incurring an early withdrawal penalty.  Traditional certificates of deposit do impose early withdrawal penalties so liquid CDs offer much more flexibility, although they pay less interest in exchange for that flexibility.",

    "news_content": "Endorsing a check involves the named recipient of the check signing their name to the back of the check in the spot indicated for endorsement. The act of endorsement signifies receipt and acceptance of the funds transfer from one party to another and allows for deposit or transfer of funds. Check endorsement is also a fraud prevention measure required by banks, as it confirms the identity of the recipient. Opening a checking account online is a simple process that involves navigating to the website of the chosen financial institution and clicking on the button indicated for opening a new account. Once the type of account is selected then personal information is entered that includes name, address, phone number, age and social security number. An online account is typically funded by either direct deposit or electronic funds transfer, which can be facilitated at account opening. Canceling a check involves contacting the bank on which check was written by mail, in person or electronically and requesting astop paymentorder which prevents the check from being honored or cashed. The stop payment order must be requested and received by the bank within 14 days of the date the check was written and typically stays in effect for six months. Online checking accounts that pay interest typically offer higher interest rates than those offered by local brick and mortar banks. They are easy to set up and offer all the advantages of a traditional bank checking account.  However, online checking accounts do not offer the in-person customer service of a physical bank in case of questions or issues with the account. They are also potentially more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Banks will honor checks written within six months. After that date banks are not legally required to honor checks, requiring the original writer of the check to issue a new check if the party is willing. Travelers checks and money orders do not expire, however. A check is a financial instrument that can be written by the account holder to a merchant or individual to settle debts at the point of sale or transfer money to another person. Checks that are received by merchants or individuals are deposited with their financial institutions are processed through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system, an electronic funds transfer system that facilitates payment processing in the U.S. A bounced check is a check that can not be processed for payment because the account from which the check is written has nonsufficient funds to cover the check. Bounced checks are also known as bad checks, which can be illegal. Bounced checks are not honored and incur bank penalty charges called NSF fees and are returned to the check writer. A debit card is a card-based payment vehicle for use at merchants or ATMs that directly processes payments or withdrawals from a checking account. Debit cards eliminate the need to write physical checks or carry cash and do not involve interest charges like credit cards. A checkbook is a small booklet of pre-printed paper documents that have the customer checking account number and bank routing number and the check number. Check numbers are sequentially printed on each check in the book. Checkbooks also include a small ledger to record information for checks written such as the check number, check amount, date and merchant or recipient name. Overdraft protection is a checking account feature that covers the amount of any non-sufficient funds on checks written from a customer account. Overdraft protection is usually offered as a credit feature that charges short term interest on the amount of any overdrafts until newly deposited funds within the checking account cover the shortfall. Float time is the period of time between when a check is written and when it is deposited in the recipient’s account and the amount of the check is transferred from the check writer’s account to the recipient’s account. While float time on checks historically averaged between 2 and 4 days it has been reduced to 1 day since the implementation of the Check 21 Act.",

    "news_content": "The best high-tech and low-tech strategies and tools for managing your money. Learn how much to save, which apps to use, which debts to focus on, how well you're doing for your age. Budgeting is the act of putting together a budget, which is an estimate of your revenue and expected expenses for a given time period. Savings refers to the money left over after your expenses are subtracted from your revenue, also within a specific time period. By creating a budget, you may be able to locate and cut any unnecessary expenditures, thereby increasing your savings. By keeping tabs on your expenses and giving yourself a plan to follow, budgeting makes it easier to meet your financial goals. Savings, meanwhile, are important because living paycheck to paycheck isn’t viable in the long-term. If you are unable to accumulate savings, you could be in serious financial trouble in the event of an unexpected expense, such as a large medical bill. The first step to budgeting is determining your net income (i.e., your total salary minus taxes and employer-provided programs) for a given time period. The next step is to figure out your fixed and variable expenses for the same period of time. You can then either decide how to utilize any surplus funds or find ways to reduce your expenses if they exceed your income. There are several budgeting plans available that can help you allocate an appropriate amount of money to each type of expense. The 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting technique that was created by Senator Elizabeth Warren. The idea is that people will be able to more easily achieve greater financial stability by dividing specific shares of their spending between distinct categories. The three categories of the 50/30/20 rule are: 50% allocated to needs (i.e., rent, healthcare, etc.), 30% to wants (i.e., travel, entertainment, etc.), and 20% toward savings/debt (i.e., retirement, student loan payments, etc.). Discretionary income refers to a portion of an individual’s income that can be spent, invested, or saved after paying for personal necessities and taxes. In this context of discretionary income, “spending” is specifically for nonessential goods and services, such as jewelry or entertainment. Although credit cards can usually be used to purchase nonessential goods and services, accruing personal debt isn’t the same thing as having a discretionary income. A budget is an estimate of what a person earns and spends within a specific time period (i.e., monthly, etc.). Budgets are useful tools for giving you a clearer picture of your finances and helping you identify any unnecessary or excessive expenditures. A budget also makes it easier to determine the timeline for long-term saving goals by calculating how much surplus savings you would have after a certain amount of time. Savings refers to an amount of money remaining from an individual or household’s disposable income after paying all of their expenses and obligations for a specific time period (i.e., monthly, etc.). Savings includes both cash as well as cash equivalents, such as bank account holdings. Although savings can be put toward many different long-term life goals, it’s also crucial to have enough saved up for emergencies. Financial health refers to the current state of a person’s monetary assets and liabilities. Although each person's financial circumstances are different, there are rough guidelines that can be used to measure anyone’s financial health. A financially healthy individual may have a steady flow of income, consistent expenses, and regularly increasing savings. An inflexible expense is a recurring expense that typically cannot be altered or eliminated. Inflexible expenses are often set at a fixed amount and payment schedule, such as a monthly rent payment. In addition to current sources of income, lenders closely examine monthly expenses when considering applicants for personal loans, mortgages, or auto loans. Quality of life refers to a non-financial measurement generally associated with job and life satisfaction. A person’s quality of life is highly subjective to their personal experience, though it is often tied to financial security (among other factors). The potential tradeoff between money and quality of life is typically taken into account when considering things like a career or a personal savings plan. Showrooming is the act of visiting brick-and-mortar retailers in order to see products in person before buying them online for a cheaper price. This practice allows customers to try out an item before making a decision to buy it while also finding the best price, which also gives an edge to online retailers. Brick-and-mortar stores have used multiple different marketing tactics to combat showrooming. The average propensity to consume (APC) is a measurement of how much of an individual’s income is spent rather than saved. The APC is calculated by dividing average household consumption (i.e., spending) by average household income (i.e., earnings). On a broader economic level, a high APC can be a sign of a healthy economy, since consumer spending drives economic growth. 50/30/20. \"Income + Financial Stability in America.\" URL:http://fiftythirtytwenty.com/",

    "news_content": "Personal finance encompasses the whole universe of managing individual and family finances, taking responsibility for your current and future financial situation, and setting financial goals. It also includes handling individual financial tasks and saving for emergencies. Personal finance is aboutmeeting your financial goalsand understanding all the routes to do this, fromsavingand investing, and keeping debt under control, tobuying a hometoplanning for retirement—and  coming up with a plan to accomplish these goals.It’s also the name of the industry that provides financial products to meet these goals. Not getting control of your personal finances can leave you unprotected when a crisis comes along–whether it’s an illness, anunexpected job loss, or the death of the family breadwinner. The pandemic that began in March 2020 showed all of these issues in sharp relief and showed the importance ofplanning for emergencies. What the pandemic showed is that people are a lot more secure if they have anemergency fund, have learned to budgetand have created a financial plan–one with a Plan B and Plan C. Those who haven’t done these things, should get busy doing them. It–and the war in Ukraine–are both wake-up calls thatstock market crashescan happen abruptly in a crisis and that everyone needs acrisis investment plan. For starters, you need to buy at leastthe minimum amountfor your state. The two types of liability coverage for an auto accident are bodily injury liability (for injury to other people) and property damage liability (for property damage). Bodily injury liability specifies  both a per-person liability and a total liability per accident. For any damage outside of that you will need to pay personally, unless you have anumbrella insurance policyto make up the difference. It's certainly looking that way. Even Warren Buffett had to switch to one in 2020. Banking is increasingly done online,budgeting appsare more convenient to use with a phone than a desktop or laptop, and it’s easier to check on your investments. And at work and elsewhere,two-factor authenticationpretty much requires having a phone. So goes getting anUber or Lyft. If you need to move large amounts of money, a wire transfer–either bank to bank or via an agent such as Western Union–is the safest way to go. Expect to pay a fee and review the fine print before you agree to the transfer. It may take a few hours or days, depending on the details. Note that a wire transfer is different from anAutomated Clearing House (ACH) transfer. Those are used to pay bills or move money between linked accounts. Managing your money—including saving, investing, and setting financial goals—are all part of personal finance. So are areas like budgeting, retirement planning, and saving for your children’s college educations. This free document-scanning and filing app from Google photographs documents like bills and receipts, and stores them as pdfs. It’s only available for Android phones and tablets, not Apple products. This is the plan you need when your car breaks down on the road. You can get this coverage from your auto insurance company, or from AAA or your credit card. Even your cellphone provider might offer  it. Your vehicle’s age and mileage might be an issue on the coverage you can get, and there will likely be limits on how far you can be towed and how many service calls you get per year. Your car warranty may also cover assistance for a newer car. Your assets and liabilities–summarized on a document or spreadsheet–are what constitute a personal financial statement. Subtracting your liabilities.  from your assets will yield your net worth. You will need a personal financial statement if you are applying for a mortgage or other loan. It will also let you track your personal worth over time. Interestingly, personal property like jewelry and antiques aren’t generally included in a personal financial statement. People with disabilities who hope to return to work often worry that they will lose their Medicare disability coverage. This government program allows them to keep their coverage for at least 8½ years. Ticket Holders can receive employment and other services from qualified service providers.",

    "news_title": "Personal Loans: The Complete Guide",
    "news_content": "Understand when it’s a good time to get a personal loan, what you need to know before getting a loan such as interest rates and risks associated with persian loans as well as the best lenders to consider. Personal loans are not counted as income and are therefore not subject to federal income tax. Interest on personal loans is not tax deductible as with mortgage loans, however. If personal loans are ever partially or completely discharged or forgiven as part of a personal bankruptcy or a debt restructuring the amount not paid will be considered income and will be subject to federal income tax. Applying for one or more personal loans can affect your credit score, as lenders must pull your full credit report before approving a loan in order to determine your creditworthiness. A full credit check, also known as a hard pull of your credit, can temporarily lower your credit score by a small amount. How you maintain the status of your personal loan also affects your credit score. If you make payments on time and in full it will help your credit score and if you don’t it will hurt your score. As with taking on any type of debt, personal loans can present certain risks - the biggest being not being able to service the debt in the form of making monthly payments. This can lead to damaged credit, having the debt go into collections and potentially having to take drastic steps like declaring personal bankruptcy. Credit cards are similar to personal loans in that they are extensions of unsecured credit. However, personal loans are generally lump sum loans made by lenders to consumers with a specific repayment term and fixed interest rate.  Credit cards are revolving lines of credit with balances that can be paid back over time if not paid in full each month. Interest rates on personal loans can vary significantly based on the credit score of the borrower as well as income level, amount borrowed and the lender involved. Most personal loans are made at fixed interest rates but variable interest rates that are indexed to the prime rate will likely become more common in a rising rate environment as lenders seek to keep consistent profit margins. A signature loan is a personal loan that can be used for any purpose and is offered by lenders to known borrowers with only their signature on the loan document as a form of collateral.  Signature loans typically carry higher interest rates vs. loans that require physical collateral since they entail more risk to the lender. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending is a type of social lending that allows borrowers to bypass the traditional financial system for getting loans and borrow directly from other individuals through P2P lending platforms like Prosper or Lending Club, which set the terms and interest rates of the loans based on borrower creditworthiness. Collateralization is the process by which a loan is secured against default by pledging sufficiently valuable assets. If the borrower ever defaulted on a collateralized loan the lender could seize the pledged assets and sell them to recoup the loan loss. A lawsuit settlement loan is a type of short term lump sum loan made by a lender to a borrower who expects to receive a reward settlement as part of a class action lawsuit or personal injury lawsuit. Once a legal settlement is made to the borrower the loan is repaid with interest. Lawsuit settlement loans typically have higher interest rates compared to traditional personal loans. A stretch loan is a short-term form of borrowing meant to cover a shortfall in income. Stretch loans are similar to payday loans and carry higher interest rates than traditional personal loans that have longer repayment terms. A cash advance is a very short term loan made through a bank, credit union, credit card issuer or non-traditional financial institution and is often used to cover immediate cash needs resulting from unexpected financial demands such as medical expenses or car repairs. Payday loans are a form of short term credit that are typically offered by non-traditional consumer finance companies and carry very high interest rates. The principal of payday loans can be a portion or more of the borrowers next paycheck. Payday loan interest rates are determined by the borrowers income but tend to be among the highest rates charged in the financial markets.",

    "news_content": "Insurance is a broad topic that includes protections of homes, cars or boats, personal health, and life itself. It is designed to protect against financial loss resulting from unforeseen circumstances by sharing or pooling the risk of loss with other policyholders. Insurance companies generate revenue from premiums paid on outstanding policies and net profit on the difference between revenue and policy claim expenses. Insurance brokers typically earn commissions on the sale of policies, either on a flat rate per policy or on a percentage of the insured amount. Insurance policies often have deductibles, especially with health and auto insurance, in order to partially offset the cost of providing coverage by the company and can keep premiums lower if customers opt for higher deductible amounts. There is definite gender bias in insurance coverage depending on type of insurance. With auto insurance there can be gender discrimination tied to income and credit scores, while with life insurance women generally pay lower rates due to longer life expectancy. Yes, insurance carriers typically offer significant discounts for those who have multiple types of coverage with their company, such as bundling car and homeowners insurance. Insurance coverage refers to the amount of protection within an insurance policy that covers a specific type of loss. Coverage is typically meant to completely replace the value of the insured item or items. In the case of life insurance the coverage amount is typically based on a fixed amount or calculated on a multiple of years of lost income should the insured person die. An insurance premium is the amount of money the customer pays to the insurance underwriter each month to maintain the policy. Insurance premiums cover the cost of providing coverage by the insurance company based on the risk or probability of loss. An insurance underwriter is the company that takes on the risk of covering a specific type of loss event in exchange for payment of premiums during the term of the policy. Insurance underwriters pool the risk of loss across large numbers of policyholders and set premiums based on the managed risk of coverage. An insurance claim is the notification of the underwriter by the policyholder that a covered loss has occurred. Insurance companies have specific processes for policyholders to file insurance claims in the event of loss along with service level expectations for claim processing that are detailed in the insurance policy contract. An insurance adjuster is an employee of the insurance underwriter who investigates covered loss claims and authorizes payouts. Once the policyholder files a claim and insurance adjuster will contact the policyholder to understand the time, date and nature of the covered claim and make an adjustment or payment based on eligibility, less any deductible. Self insurance is a process by which a person or company assumes the risk of loss themselves by saving the money that would have otherwise been paid in the form of premiums in order to build up a fund to cover potential losses. Individuals that choose to self insure bare all the risk for a loss event rather than pooling the risk with other people who might also experience the type of loss that might present financial loss.",

    "news_title": "Mortgage Types and How Each One Works",
    "news_content": "Finding the right mortgage lender and the right mortgage loan to buy a house is not easy. You have to consider loan types and costs, customer experience, lender stability, and much more. Investopedia / Tara Anand We designed and built a robust data collection and analysis process to evaluate lenders and help borrowers find and choose the best purchase mortgage loan for them. First, we surveyed recent homebuyers about their experience and learned what features and services were most important to them. This information fueled the creation of a list of 55 criteria to include in a quantitative model to rank 38 direct-to-borrower lenders. We then collected over 2,000 data points for the model, surveying mortgage lenders and collecting data via media contacts, lender websites, customer service calls, and industry and government databases. After collection and verification, we weighted 36 of the 55 individual criteria, giving higher weight to those criteria that mean the most to borrowers. Those scores resulted in the following list of the best mortgage lenders. Many mortgage servicers accept online payments directly through their websites—register for an online account and connect your checking account so you can schedule payments. Another option is to use the online bill-pay service through your checking account to pay for your mortgage. Make sure to find out how far in advance you need to schedule your payment so your loan servicer receives it on time. If your credit is bad, you can still be approved for a mortgage through a Federal Housing Administration Loan with 10% down, as long as your credit score is at least 500. You also may be able to improve your credit more quickly than you think to qualify for a conventional mortgage. Closing costs are the fees over and above the property purchase price due at the closing of a real estate transaction. They may include fees related to the mortgage loan origination and underwriting, commissions, taxes, and insurance premiums, as well as title and record filings. Lenders are prohibited from discriminating against borrowers who are ill or disabled, so they are not allowed to ask questions related to your physical condition. Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, lenders are not allowed to ask if you are planning a family. In the past, this question was used to discriminate against female borrowers because lenders assumed women would quit work when they became pregnant. The longer you can prove income history for self-employment in the same industry, the more likely you are to be approved for a mortgage. As a general rule, you'll want to have at least two years of documented self-employment income at or above the level you need to afford the loan you want. First, interest rates determine how much we will have to pay to borrow money to buy a property, and they influence the value of real estate. Second, low interest rates tend to increase demand for property, driving up prices, while high interest rates generally do the opposite. A mortgage pre-approval is a statement from a lender that a borrower is likely to be approved for a loan of a certain value. It is not a guarantee, as it is based on assumptions and estimates. But it helps borrowers know what they can afford, and it demonstrates to sellers that a buyer is serious, and well-qualified. This clause states that a penalty will be assessed if the borrower significantly pays down or pays off the mortgage, often within the first five years of the loan. The penalty protects lenders against losing interest income, and mortgage lenders are required to disclose prepayment penalties at the time of closing on a new mortgage. An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a home loan with an interest rate that can fluctuate periodically based on the performance of a specific benchmark. ARMs generally have caps that limit how much the interest rate and/or payments can rise per year or over the lifetime of the loan. Mortgage interest, calculated as a certain percentage of the full mortgage loan, is the interest charged on a loan used to purchase a piece of property. Mortgage interest may be fixed or variable and is compounding. A mortgage rate lock guarantees the current rate of interest on a home loan while a home buyer proceeds through the purchase and closing process—it protects borrowers from the potential of rising interest rates during the home buying process. Typically, a rate lock period ranges from 30 to 60 days. A buydown is a mortgage financing strategy that lets a buyer obtain a lower interest rate for at least the first few years of the mortgage or possibly its entire life. Buydowns can save homeowners money on interest over the life of the loan. A buydown may involve purchasing discount points against the mortgage loan, which may require an up-front fee. If you purchase a home with a down payment of less than 20% of the home's cost, you will likely need to pay for private mortgage insurance (PMI). This insurance protects the lender, not the borrower, against potential losses should the home fall into foreclosure. Borrowers can remove PMI when their equity in the home surpasses 20%. A conventional mortgage is simply a mortgage issued by a private lender and not backed or insured by a governmental agency such as the FHA or the USDA. Many conventional mortgages are also \"conforming.\" This means they conform to the requirements set by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. These government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) buy mortgages issued by lenders to help the market stay liquid and affordable. A mortgage broker brings mortgage borrowers and mortgage lenders together but does not use their own funds to originate mortgages. A mortgage broker finds the best lender for the borrower's financial situation and interest-rate needs and later assists with the application and underwriting processes. Closing is the final step in home buying when the mortgage becomes official and the title transfers to the new owners. A closing agent, often an attorney or official from a title or mortgage company, oversees the closing process, which usually takes place at a title company orescrowoffice, althoughonline or remote closingis becoming more popular.",

The U.S. Department of Education currently offers direct subsidized loans, direct unsubsidized loans, direct PLUS loans, and direct consolidation loans. Subsidized loans are solely for eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need to help cover the costs of a higher education, while unsubsidized loans are available for eligible undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, though eligibility isn’t based on financial need. PLUS loans are made to graduate or professional students as well as parents of dependent undergraduate students for education expenses not covered by other financial aid. A consolidation loan allows you to combine all of your eligible federal student loans into one loan with a sole loan servicer. It depends on your financial circumstances. Since interest may accumulate on your student loans while you’re in school (depending on the type of loan), it may make sense to begin making payments toward your debt before the actual due date kicks in.There are no penalties for making prepayments on either federal or private student loans, so if you are able it can save you some money to start early. The first day following a missed student loan payment, your student loan becomes past due (i.e.,delinquent) until you either repay the past due amount or make other arrangements with your creditor. Remaining delinquent for 90 days or more will result in your loan servicer reporting the delinquency to the three major national credit bureaus. Following a certain period of delinquency, which varies based on the type of loan, there is also a risk of the loan going intodefault. Per theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), most employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as a 401(k), are protected from seizure by creditors in nearly all cases.However, according to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, up to 15% of your Social Security payments can be garnished to repay your federal student loan(s) should you default. Fortunately, the amount garnished cannot reduce your monthly benefit payment below $750. An education loan, more commonly known as a student loan, is an amount of money borrowed from a federal or private lender to pay for a higher education. This sum can be used to cover the cost of tuition, textbooks, other school supplies, and basic living expenses so that a student may focus on earning their degree. Generally speaking, federal student loans offer lower interest rates than their private counterparts. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program is a federal student loan program offered by the U.S. Department of Education. The Federal Direct Loan Program is available to eligible postsecondary students and their parents. Direct subsidized loans, direct unsubsidized loans, direct PLUS loans, and direct consolidation loans are all available through this program. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is an official form that must be filled out in order to receive financial aid from the federal government. To complete the FAFSA, you must provide information about yourself and your financial situation. The FAFSA is available starting Oct. 1 of the year prior to enrollment, and the federal due date is June 30 of the academic year (some colleges and/or states have their own deadlines). A FAFSA award letter is provided by the colleges that are listed on your FAFSA form and details the cost of attendance for an academic year and your eligibility for any grants, loans, etc. Most colleges send out award letters alongside their admission offer letters. Although colleges have access to your FAFSA information a day after it’s processed, the timeframes for reviewing your FAFSA information may vary from one university to another. A deferment period is an amount of time where a borrower isn't required to repay their loan's principal or interest. Deferment periods vary based on the type of loan; student loans can only be deferred for up to three years. Depending on the type of student loan, you may still have to pay down the interest that accrues during the deferment period. A PLUS loan is offered to graduate & professional students and the parents of dependent undergraduates. While eligibility isn’t based on financial need, a credit check is required, and borrowers with an adverse credit history won’t be eligible without meeting other criteria.The max amount available to you will be based on your chosen college's cost of attendance minus any financial aid you’ve received. A direct consolidation loan allows you to combine all of your eligible federal student loans into just one loan with a sole loan servicer.Your consolidated loan will have a fixed interest rate based on the average of the original loans’ interest rates. Consolidating multiple loans can be accomplished at no cost to you and allows you to reduce your number of monthly payments. A student loan interest deduction allows you to deduct up to $2,500 of the interest paid on qualified student loans during the tax year. The deduction is only available if you meet certain eligibility criteria, and it’s gradually reduced as your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) reaches its annual limit. This interest deduction is claimed as an adjustment to income, so it don't need to itemized on your income tax returns.

    "news_title": "Credit & Debt: Managing Both Wisely",
    "news_content": "Know the difference between how much you owe (debt) and how much you can borrow (credit). Learn how to manage both to avoid financial trouble and understand how credit scores are calculated. Most lenders use FICO credit scores, although some use a rival credit score called the Vantage score. The type of FICO or Vantage score can vary depending on the type of loan being applied for.  For example, lenders use a specific score variation from one of the major score providers for credit cards vs a mortgage or home equity line of credit. The most important components of credit include history of on-time payments, types of credit owned, amounts owed and credit utilization. Another thing that goes into a person’s credit score is the length of credit history, which means the age of the oldest account on file. A credit card is a card-based form of payment that has a revolving credit line. It is different from a line of credit that is typically a standalone loan with a set loan amount that can be accessed as needed with a check. Once a check is written against a line of credit principal and interest is paid back in installments. Credit scores can be positively or negatively affected by consumer behavior such as paying balances owed on or before the due date, the percentage of utilization of credit lines and the number of credit accounts that are open. Lenders report the opening and maintenance of credit accounts to credit reporting companies each month that accounts are open. Account balances, payment behavior and account status (such as current, overdue or in default) are also reported. Credit refers to the extension of financial borrowing privileges from one individual or organization to another. Ultimately, credit is based on trust between the lender and borrower that the amount owed will be repaid. Credit generally entails measurement and verification of the creditworthiness of the borrower by the lender. A hard inquiry refers to a lender pulling a full credit report on an individual from a credit reporting company in order to determine their creditworthiness for a loan or revolving line of credit. A hard inquiry can temporarily lower the credit applicant’s credit score as where a soft inquiry, which entails a more cursory view of a borrower’s credit, does not. Credit rating generally refers to an individual’s creditworthiness as measured by a credit score. It can also apply to corporate entities as it relates to the ability of a company to borrow money in the capital markets or issue debt instruments such as corporate bonds. Credit history is the accumulated credit account behavior of an individual that is tracked by credit reporting agencies. Lenders such as banks and credit card issuers report their customers’ accounts, credit usage and payment behavior to credit reporting agencies such as Experian, Equifax and TransUnion each month, forming credit profiles. Credit quality is another term for creditworthiness, meaning the level at which lenders assign credit amounts and terms based on risk level. Banks and other types of lenders measure credit quality objectively using credit scores based on factors such as types of credit owned, on-time payment history, credit utilization and age of credit. Buy Now, Pay Later, also known as BNPL, is a relatively recent take on the old layaway plans of the past. However, unlike layaway plans, Buy Now, Pay Later allows the buyer to take possession of the goods immediately and break up payments into four equal installments over a short period of time.",

    "news_content": "With the right strategy and responsible spending, credit cards can help you build credit, earn rewards, and more. Learn how credit cards work, what interest rates they charge, and how to use your cards in smart and effective ways. Finding the right credit card is an important personal decision, and one size does not fit all. Whether you're a frequent shopper, savvy saver, strategic traveler, a student just getting started, or a small business owner growing a brand, Investopedia has identified the best credit cards to help you pick the one that fits your individual financial needs while earning rewards. After collecting over 50 data points across more than 300 credit cards, these are the best credit cards for different lifestyles, consumer spending categories, and credit scores. Read about all of thebest credit cardsbefore deciding which is right for you. You can complete a credit card application in several ways: online, on a paper application, or on the phone. Applying for a credit card online is convenient and you can get a decision almost immediately. Be prepared with personal details like your date of birth and social security number; details on income and housing costs; and information on any authorized users you want to add to the account. Credit card approval can often be obtained instantly online but getting the plastic in your hands is another matter. If you are in a particular hurry many issuers can ship your card for overnight delivery, but at a significant cost. Otherwise it generally takes 3 - 10 business days to get your new credit card through the U.S. mail. Credit card issuers determine each cardholder’s credit limit based on many factors, the most important of which is the customer’s credit score. Other factors typically include employment status, income level and debt to income ratio. Whether credit limits are a set dollar amount or are dynamic, i.e. not pre-set, the creditworthiness of the borrower is the most important consideration for lenders in determining how much credit to extend. Very often it is quite possible to lower the interest rate on your credit card account if you contact your card issuer’s customer service department with the request.  Your account must be in good standing to be eligible for an interest rate adjustment, however, which means you have not been late with previous payments or exceeded your credit limit. Credit card disputes typically arise when consumers unsuccessfully attempt to get a refund from a merchant for unwanted or defective merchandise or they notice an unauthorized charge on their credit card statement.  In these cases the customer should contact their card issuer to dispute a charge either online or by calling the toll-free number on the back of their card. A credit card is a small plastic payment device connected to a revolving credit account issued by a financial services company or national bank that is accepted by network merchants for the purchase of goods and services. Credit cards typically feature an embossed account number, expiration date and cardmember name on the front of the card along with the payment network logo, security chip  and card issuer name. The back of a credit card features a magnetic strip, holographic network logo and security number along with customer service numbers to contact in case of loss or theft. A credit card balance is the sum total of all the charges made during the current billing cycle in addition to any balances that were carried forward from previous billing periods. Credit card balances can not exceed the credit limit on the account. The ratio of credit card balances to the credit limit determines the level of utilization of the account, which is factored into the calculation of the individual’s credit score. Credit card debt is the unsecured liability that is incurred by a consumer when they carry balances forward past the due date. Revolving credit card debt is subject to minimum payments of approximately 3-5% of the total balance each month and is subject to the regular interest rate on the account unless promotional or penalty rates are in effect. The minimum monthly payment on a credit card account is the greater of either a stated percentage of outstanding balances (typically 3-5%, depending on the issuer) or a fixed dollar amount (typically $5 - $10). Cardholders must make at least the minimum payment due each month on their account in order to keep it in good standing. Balances that remain after making the minimum monthly payment are subject to interest rate charges. A credit card grace period is the amount of time in days between the statement closing date and the due date for the charges made in the current billing cycle. Interest is not assessed on balances accrued during the current billing cycle if payment is made in full on or before the due date.  The interest-free grace period only applies to current balances if no previous balances were carried forward from the previous billing period. A Schumer box is a set of credit card terms and conditions disclosure in table form that are mandated to be displayed within credit card advertising material.  The Schumer box displays such details as annual percentage rates  for new credit card purchases, balance transfers, balance transfer fees, annual fees and other potential costs to consumers.",

    "news_content": "Knowing the tax rules can help you plan your financial life and not pay more than necessary. Pretty much everyone pays some taxes, whether they are federal, state, local income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, or capital gains. Just 5 states don’t impose state sales taxes: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. However, that doesn’t keep them from chargingincome tax,excise taxesor tourist taxes. And it doesn’t mean that cities or municipalities within those states can’t change a local sales tax. There are complicated rules for how stock-option taxes are calculated, sometimes depending on whether the options the employer granted are statutory stock options—granted under an employee stock purchase plan or anincentive stock option (ISO)plan—or nonstatutory ones. ISO options affectalternative minimum taxand nonstatutory options have three possible tax events, so get the help of a tax advisor to handle stock options issues. Documents around property acquisition and improvements are especially important forcapital gains tax when you sell your home; so are documents needed by heirs to establish thecost basisof stocks they inherit. Start by using the exclusion for $250,000 of capital gains ($500,000) for married couples if the home was your primary residence for at least two of the last five years. Then look at all the expenditures you made that can reduce the amount of capital gains—for example,capital improvements, settlement feesand closing costs. Alternative minimum tax (AMT)is a system invented to make sure that higher income people with significant tax deductions didn’t avoid paying federal income tax. It uses a separate set of rules to calculate the tax owed after adding certain tax preference items back intoadjusted gross income (AGI).What you need to do is keep your AGI as low as possible through maximizing salary deferrals and pre-tax contributions to flexible spending plans and the like, keeping tax-efficient investments in taxable investment accounts, and taking all the tax credits of which you qualify. Some of these are simple carelessness, such as using the wrong line of the form or entering incorrect figures or names. Others are automatically taking thestandard deduction, missingwrite-offs, making math errors, not telling the IRS what to do with your refund, and making payment mistakes. This is a nine-digit tracking number used by theInternal Revenue Service (IRS)and is required on all tax returns. It is required information on all tax returns filed with the IRS. The IRS issues all U.S. tax identification numbers (TIN) or tax I.D. numbers. Two tax ID numbes not issued by the IRS: Social Security numbers (SSNs), which are issued by theSocial Security Administration (SSA)and foreign tax identifying numbers (foreign TIN), which are issued by the country in which the non-U.S. taxpayer pays taxes. Some states impose these taxes on heirs. Unlike the estate tax, which is paid by the deceased’s estate, this tax is paid by the beneficiary. States that charge inheritance taxes: Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. There is no federal inheritance tax. Largely paid by businesses on goods and services at purchase, these taxes can bead valorem(a percentage of the cost) or specific (a set dollar amount). Excise taxes levied on goods with a high social cost such as alcohol and tobacco are known assin taxes. Motor fuels, airline tickets, and health services are other major sources of excise tax revenue. These taxes are paid by the manufacturer or retailer, not the consumer, but are passed on to the consumer in the form of higher costs.Excise taxeson fuel, alcohol, and tobacco are one example of an indirect tax. So areimport dutiespaid by those who import goods from outside the country. A consumption tax imposed on goods and services, a sales tax is paid at the point of sale by the consumer and is collected by the seller. A manufacturer at an interim step in the manufacturing process (say a yarn maker who sells the yarn to a sweater manufacturer) can obtain a certificate of resale to avoid being charged sales tax on the yarn. This is any tax on the purchase of goods and services.Sales taxes,excise taxesandtariffsare all consumption taxes. They are taxes on what you spend, rather than taxes on what you earn (income taxes). Income or transactions that aren’t subject to any federal, state, or local tax are tax exempt. Some religious andcharitable organizationsare also tax exempt. So are earnings frommunicipal bonds.",

    "news_content": "Students have endless questions about money, especially as the way we use money on a daily basis continues to change. With this free resource hub from Investopedia, you can break down the jargon and teach financial literacy to the next generation. Investopedia / Alice Morgan Investopedia is committed to extending our reach and resources to schools and underserved communities that have traditionally been left out of the conversation. That’s why we’ve created free content and materials to support today’s investing environment, found here in the Financial Literacy Resource Center and our new newsletter,The Classroom Investor. In the table below, you’ll find downloadable lesson plans filled with guidance and worksheets that can be used to supplement classroom or at-home learning for children in grades K-5. There are eight lessons per grade, and each lesson plan builds on the preceding one. The subject matter also gets more detailed as students get older. (Simply right-click on each lesson to be taken to a new tab, and then you can download the content from there.) Keep scrolling, and you'll find teen-focused content, too. While this is only the beginning, these resources will help anyone become an engaged and educated participant in the ever-evolving financial markets. The content within the lesson plans above was crafted using guidance from educators within public schools and nonprofits in the U.S., andKara Cordellof Oklahoma City Public Schools served as an invaluable resource in content creation. The Investopedia team piloted the content at Timber Lakes Elementary School in Orlando, Florida. Financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various skills and concepts, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. A strong foundation of financial literacy—especially one that starts at an early age—can help support various life goals, such as saving for education or retirement, using debt responsibly, and running a business. This section of Investopedia is a free, digital library for educators, teachers, and parents looking for materials to help them teach the next generation of investors. Linked in the table on this page are downloadable lesson plans, worksheets, and guidance that can be used to supplement classroom or at-home learning for children in grades K-5. Investopedia has also curated a collection of articles to help set teens (grades 9-12) up for success as they start working and/or pursue higher education. The K-5 lessons plans available to download from this library cover the fundamentals of personal finance and investing, as appropriate for each age level. These lesson plans have been reviewed by licensed educators, and used by Timberlakes Elementary School in Orlando, Florida. The articles in this library for parents and teachers of teens (grades 9-12) focus primarily on building and using credit, investing, digital money management (e.g. usingVenmo or Apple Pay), and real-world applications of personal finance topics. Yes! Investopedia is committed to making financial literacy accessible for everyone. As more lesson plans and articles become available, we will update this resource page. Follow us on social media@investopedia, and bookmark this webpage to stay looped into the latest. In addition to our content library, theInvestopedia Stock Simulatoris an instructional tool for students (or yourself) to practice trading and investing in stocks in a safe, simulated environment. We also have a monthly newsletter for educators, “The Classroom Investor,” to give context to financial news, new product developments, and share additional free teaching resources. Financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. When an individual is financially literate, you have the foundation of a relationship with money, and it is a lifelong journey of learning. A credit score is a number from 300 to 850 that rates a consumer or individual’s creditworthiness. It is based on credit history: number of open accounts, total levels of debt, repayment history, and other factors. The higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders, because lenders use credit scores to evaluate the probability that an individual will repay loans in a timely manner. Interest is the monetary charge for borrowing money—generally expressed as a percentage, such as an annual percentage rate (APR). Interest is the amount of money a lender or financial institution receives for lending out money. And interest can also refer to the amount of ownership a stockholder has in a company, usually expressed as a percentage. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. The most commonly known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. Generally, as of March 2022, cryptocurrencies are not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. Diversification is a risk management strategy where one chooses a variety of investments for their portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types, such as stocks and bonds, in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The idea is that different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security. An asset class is a group of investments that have similar characteristics and are subject to the same laws and regulations. Historically, the three main asset classes have been equities (stocks), fixed income (bonds), and cash equivalent or money market instruments. An import is a good or service that was produced in one country, and bought in another one. Imports, along with exports, are one of the key components of international trade. If the value of a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports, the country has a negative balance of trade, also known as a trade deficit. The term \"security\" in finance refers to a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. Securities are used to raise capital in public and private markets. The primary types of securities are equity—which provides ownership rights to holders—debt, and hybrids, which combine aspects of debt and equity. A mobile wallet stores credit card or debit card information on a mobile device like your phone, a tablet, or smartwatch. With a mobile wallet, one can buy things online or in stores more easily. They may also be more secure than physical payment cards because of the technology they use to protect your account information. Simply put, compound interest is the interest you earn on interest. It is calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Compounding multiplies money at an accelerated rate and the greater the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest will be. Consumer debt includes personal debts that are owed as a result of purchasing goods that are used for individual or household consumption. Examples of consumer debt include credit card debt, student loans, auto loans, mortgages, and payday loans. These can be extended by a bank, the federal government, and credit unions. Fintech, or financial technology, is used to describe new technology that seeks to improve and simplify the delivery and use of financial services. Fintech is utilized by companies, business owners, and consumers, in an effort to better manage financial operations, processes, and lives. Examples of fintech applications include robo-advisors, payment apps, and investment apps, among others. Net worth is the value of the assets a person or corporation owns, minus the liabilities they owe. It is an important metric to gauge a company's health, providing a useful snapshot of its current financial position. Net worth has also become popular in everyday culture, with lists ranking the people with the highest net worth as well as the net worth of various celebrities.",

    "news_title": "Economy",
    "news_content": "The economy is the total of all activities related to the production, sale, distribution, exchange, and consumption of limited resources by a group of people living and operating within it. In a command economy, a centralized government controls the means of production and it decides the output levels for that production. This type of economy is often associated with communist nations. The advantages of this approach include better equality and lower unemployment, but there is often a lack of efficiency or innovation in those economies. A market economy, or free economy, is directed through the laws of supply and demand to set the prices and quantities for most goods and services. Most developed nations are technically mixed economies because they blend free markets with some government interference such as industrial subsidies, licensing, and price fixing. Inflation means the rate at which the same goods and services come to cost more. If a person's income doesn't keep up with inflation, it can decrease your purchasing power. It can also lower the value of Treasury bonds. But if some level of inflation is expected, it can drive consumer spending, which drives economic growth. When the price of a large number of stocks is on the rise, it can lead to higher consumer and business confidence, higher spending on big-ticket items such as cars and houses, and an increase in investors entering the stock market. These factors can all lead to greater economic development of a country. The United States has a mixed economy. It combines elements of a command economy with a market economy. A mixed economy allows for government oversight and regulation to achieve public good while also allowing things like consumer goods and services to be regulated by the laws of supply and demand. An economy encompasses all activity related to the production, consumption, trade, and distribution of available goods and services. The management of those resources is used to satisfy the needs of the people, businesses, organizations, and governments in a specific area. Currency, or money, is a generally accepted, recognized, and centralized medium of exchange that market participants use to engage in transactions for goods and services in an economy. Each government has its own money system that is monitored by a central authority. The buying, selling, or bartering of goods and services is known as trade. In an economy, a trade takes place between a producer and a consumer, usually in exchange for money. An exchange of goods and services between two countries is international trade. A knowledge economy is a system of consumption and production based on the intangible assets of intellectual capital. It refers to the ability to capitalize on scientific discoveries and academic research, and has come to represent a large component of all economic activity in developed countries. Wealthy is an abundant supply of valuable economic assets or resources owned by a person, company, community, or nation. It can be determined by subtracting debt from the total market value of all physical and intangible assets. The law of supply and demand is an economic theory based on two separate \"laws\" that explain the interaction between the sellers of a resource and the buyers of that resource. The theory defines the relationship between the price of a given good or product and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it. Generally, as the price increases, people are willing to supply more and demand less and vice versa when the price falls. A decline of thepurchasing powerof a specific currency over time is known as inflation. You can see the rate of decline reflected in the increase of an average price level of abasket of selected goodsand services in an economy over a specified period of time. The rise in the general level of prices, often expressed as a percentage, means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods. An association of workers united as a single entity, known as organized labor or a union, seek to improve the economic status and working conditions of employees through collective bargaining with management. The colloquial phrase \"sluggish economy\" is not an exact and quantifiable thing. It is derived from an analogy to a slug and refers to an economy in which growth is slow in macroeconomic terms. It can be used to describe an entire economy or a segment of it. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of a country's overall domestic production and a measure of that country's overall economic health. It is calculated by the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period.",

    "news_title": "Government & Policy: Economic Impact",
    "news_content": "Governments can have an enormous impact on the economy. Learn how the government affects taxes, trade, markets, interest rates, and more through policy, regulation, and legislation. The most common way governments control inflation is by raising or lowering interest rates. Put simply, high interest rates counter inflation by reducing the money supply, and low interest rates promote inflation by increasing the money supply. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve indirectly controls interest rates through the federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other for loans made overnight. Communism and socialism both advocate for a more equitable distribution of wealth than that achieved under capitalism, but they differ in their means and the extremity of their vision. A basic premise of communism is that a communist order is achieved through a revolution in which the working class (proletariat) overthrows the ruling class (bourgeoisie). Socialism insists on working within existing systems to implement reform. Communism also advocates the dissolution of all private property so that all property is owned by the state, which distributes resources evenly between citizens. Under socialism, the means of accumulating wealth (industry and commerce) are collectively-owned and managed by the government, but property like homes and personal possessions can remain privately-owned. According to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, U.S. healthcare spending is expected to reach $6.2 trillion, or 20% of GDP, by 2028. In 2020, spending per person was $12,530, the highest of any developed country. Norway, which ranked second in terms of healthcare costs, spent $6,748 per person, almost half of U.S. expenditures. Monetary policy refers to the actions taken by a central bank to achieve economic goals like low unemployment and stable prices. Monetary policy is often executed through the increase or decrease of the money supply. Fiscal policy refers to the government’s tax and spending plans. Fiscal policy is administered by the legislative and executive branches of government. The discount window is a Federal Reserve lending facility that makes short-term, collateralized loans to financial institutions. These loans are made to banks when they are experiencing liquidity shortfalls. The fed offers these loans at the discount rate, a fixed interest rate that the Federal Reserve usually sets slightly above the federal funds rate—the rate that applies to short-term loans between banks—to incentivize banks to borrow from each other rather than the central bank. Corporate taxes are, like an individual’s income taxes, a portion of a company’s profit levied by a government to finance public services. Though there is a set corporate tax rate in the U.S., companies often pay a much lower effective tax rate by exploiting loopholes, a subject of near-constant controversy. A government-sponsored enterprise is a privately-run company that was established by the U.S. Congress to improve the flow of credit to certain sectors of the U.S. economy. The best-known GSEs are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which essentially buy whole mortgage loans from lenders to sell to investors in smaller chunks. Though GSEs are not controlled by the government and their bonds are not backed by the U.S. Treasury, they enjoy the benefits of an “implicit guarantee” that the government won’t stand by while they fail or default on their debt. The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) is a U.S. law, passed in 1935 alongside theSocial Security Act, that mandates a payroll tax to fund Social Security and Medicare. FICA taxes are levied at a rate set by the federal government every year, and are paid by both the employee and the employer. Self-employed individuals, since they do not have an employer, are subject to a similar law called the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA). Tariffs are a tax imposed by a government on foreign goods when they enter the territory under that government’s control. Tariffs can be specific or ad valorem. Specific tariffs are levies of a specific amount of money per item or unit (e.g., $1 per pound of apples.) Ad valorem tariffs are levies of a percentage of the value of the import (e.g., 10% of a shipment of cars valued at $10 million.) Governments usually impose tariffs to support domestic producers by making their goods competitive with or more attractive than imported goods. The national debt is the amount of money a federal government owes creditors. National debt is accumulated when a government sells debt securities—Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, in the case of the U.S.—worth more than the revenue it brings in through, for example, taxes. Creditors can include individual investors, financial institutions, corporations, and even other countries’ governments. Antitrust laws are regulations intended to ensure competition between companies within a market economy. Antitrust laws allow regulatory authorities to break up monopolies and block mergers and acquisitions that would over-concentrate market power. They also aim to prevent corporations from colluding with one another or forming cartels to fix prices and stymie challengers.",

    "news_title": "Monetary Policy",
    "news_content": "Monetary policy describes the ways in which the central banks change the money supply in order to accomplish certain economic objectives. In the U.S. this is done by the Federal Reserve. Monetary policy is how central banks influence the economy by raising or lowering the money supply. This is in contrast to fiscal policy, which is how the government uses its taxes and spending to affect the economy. Monetary policy has a few main tools—reserve requirements, discount rates, open market operations (OMO), and quantitative easing (QE). Monetary policy affects markets in many ways, however, two main ones include boosting or dampening the economy as a whole, and raising or lowering bond yields. First, as expansionary monetary policy can boost the economy as a whole, investments more sensitive to the business cycle will usually benefit and vice versa with contractionary policy. Secondly, monetary policy’s effect on interest rates causes yields to rise and fall, which changes the relative value of existing interest-bearing investments. Expansionary monetary policy is when a central bank increases the money supply which fights recessions and increases economic growth. Contractionary economic policy pulls money out of the economy in order to fight inflation. Tapering is the process of gradually decreasing the size of an expansionary monetary policy. This can include any form of monetary policy but is most often applied to quantitative easing (QE). Foreign exchange reserves, also called Forex reserves, are stores of foreign currencies held by central banks. The central banks use these to purchase their own currency to carry out monetary policy. M2 is one way to measure the money supply. It includes all cash and checking deposits, referred to as M1, as well as savings deposits, money market securities, and certificates of deposit (CD). The IMF is a multinational organization meant to promote economic growth, ensure the stability of the world financial system, and lower poverty. It offers grants, loans, and other financial assistance to countries to accomplish these goals. A liquidity trap is when cash savings rates are high and interest rates are low. This combination makes it difficult for monetary policy to affect the economy. Economic stimulus refers to policies undertaken by a government or central bank to increase economic growth and counter recession. These can be either fiscal or monetary in nature. A currency is anything that serves as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Most countries have a standard currency to serve these functions in that country. The monetary policy trilemma is the inability to simultaneously have a fixed currency exchange rate, allow capital to flow in and out of a country freely, and maintain an autonomous monetary policy. A country can only have two of the above and the decision as to which two is a critical part of monetary policy.",

    "news_content": "Learn how much you need to retire comfortably, and how to prepare for the \"unexpected.\" Plan for everything from living expenses, to healthcare, to planning that trip you've always wanted to take. If you haven’t been tracking all this already, this is the time to calculate how much money you will need and how much income you can expect to have. Do the math, figure out whether you’re on track, and decide what to do next–everything from changing needs or retirement income to working a few more years. Start by understanding your investment options–both the different types of retirement accounts and thevarious investment categories. Then start saving early, track your net worth, keep your cool, and watch out for fees that sap your gains. And unless you’re really good at this, don’t go it alone. Retirement isn’t just one step called “stop working at a job.” After thepre-retirement stageand the big good-bye, expect to move through a honeymoon phase, disenchantment, the job of building a new identity, and finally settling into a routine. If you’re thinking of relocating after you retire, here are the best placesin both the U.S. and abroad, according to retirement researchers. Be sure to make extended visits to any new location you’re considering before making the move, especially if it involves living in another culture where people speak a different language. One rule is that people generally need 80% of their current income in retirement. Will you have that much? Start by estimating your future expenses, looking at how much you’ll get from Social Security, and reviewing yourretirement savings accountsand any pensions, plus other savings you may have. Not thinking ahead can decimate your retirement. Among the bad steps: quitting your job before checking on your retirement-planvestingstatus, not saving or planning, not maxing out employermatchingfunds, investment mistakes, poor tax planning and taking Social Security early. This is an amount that people age 72 or over (the age requirement may rise to 75) must take from many tax-advantaged retirement accounts, including traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, Roth 401(k)s, and 403(b) accounts.The required amount is based on an IRS formula and thepenalties for not taking RMDs are stiff. The retirement-planning process sets retirement income goals and builds out the steps required to get there. These include determining income sources and expected expenses, creating a savings plan utilizing thebest retirement account choices for you, and choosing investments. Prepare to adjust your plan to fit changing circumstances. This rule recommends that, in order to ensure a safe, steady steam of income,  retirees withdraw no more than 4% of their savings every year. Based on historical data, this rule is designed to ensure that savings last throughout retirement. Some experts think the rule could rise to 5% and others that 3% is more prudent with current interest rates. Proponents of this movement, based ona best-selleroriginally published in 1992, save aggressively in order to retire well before age 65. This can involve stashing up to 70% of income until savings reach around 30 times expenses. Then the saver can retire, continuing to live on a very tight budget but without the constrictions of daily work. SEPP is a way to receive funds from anIRAor otherqualified retirement planbefore age 59½. It lets the recipient avoid incurring IRSwithdrawal penaltiesof 10% of the distributed amount. The process involves specified annual distributions for a period of five years or until the account-holder turns 59½, whichever comes later. Income tax is still due on withdrawals. This is an additional contribution that people aged 50 or older can make totax-advantagedretirement accounts, including traditional and Roth IRAs, traditional and Roth 401(k)s,403(b)s, most457 plans, the federal government’sThrift Savings Plan (TSP),SIMPLE IRAsandSimplified Employee Pensions (SEPs). People who withdraw from tax-advantaged retirement plans before age 59½ are usually subject towithdrawal penalties. However, emergency withdrawals in response to “an immediate and heavy financial need,” as the IRS terms it, may be allowed under certain circumstances. For 401(k)s, theemployer’s rules determinewhich situations are permitted.",

    "news_title": "Fiscal Policy",
    "news_content": "Fiscal policy refers to taxing and spending policies of governments, often with a specific focus on budgeting and the effect of taxing and spending on the broader economy. Fiscal policy is one of, if not the, largest way in which governments affect economies. There is nothing inherent preventing state and local governments from running deficits in the same way that national governments do. However, almost all U.S. State constitutions have balanced budget amendments, which legally prevent those specific states from doing so. Contractionary fiscal policy can decrease the crowding-out effect by increasing the amount of credit available to other borrowers because less lending is going to the government to finance its debt. No, States cannot declare bankruptcy as it is not permitted by U.S. bankruptcy law. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1977 that Article 1, Section 10 of the U.S. forbids them from doing so. Deficits are a critical tool in fiscal policy, allowing extra spending over and above what the government collects in taxes. This allows governments to finance important initiatives such as infrastructure improvement, economic stimulus during economic downturns, and national defense in wartime. Fiscal policy refers to how governments collect and spend money. Fiscal policy is critical to how the government affects the economy at large. A subsidy is money given to an individual or organization by the government. Government subsidies are often given to businesses to try to bolster sectors of the economy considered especially important. A financial system is a network of organizations that enable financial transactions. Financial systems are made up of, among other institutions, banks, insurance companies, and stock brokerages. While there is a global financial system, there are also many national and regional financial systems that interact with and overlap with each other and the world financial system. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, the colloquial name for the United States Tariff Act of 1930, raised U.S. tariffs on many goods by 20%. This tariff, passed after the onset of the Great Depression, provoked retaliatory tariffs from many other countries. This trade war likely resulted in economic damage, but the amount is disputed. Implementation lag refers to the length of time between when an economic event, like a recession, begins, and when government interventions to deal with it are put in place. As such, governments need to try and take this lag into account or their interventions may be tailored to situations that are now passed. The works progress administration was a fiscal stimulus program created in 1935 as part of the New Deal to combat the Great Depression. It sought to lower the unemployment rate by directly hiring people to do various kinds of work, such as building infrastructure projects.",

    "news_content": "Economics is a social science concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It's comprised of broader macroeconomics and consumer-centric microeconomics. As a field of study, economics allows us to better understand economic systems and the human decision making behind them. Due to the existence of resource scarcity, economics is important because it deals with the study of how societies use/distribute scarce resources and how these processes can be accomplished more efficiently. For some economists, the ultimate goal of economic science is to improve the quality of life for people in their everyday lives, as better economic conditions means greater access to necessities like food, housing, and safe drinking water. The 18th-century Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith is widely considered to be the father of contemporary economics. Smith’s book,An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, is often cited as both his most notable contribution to the field of economics and one of the most influential books ever written. Some of his most famous ideas include the concept of gross domestic product (GDP) and the “invisible hand” behind the free market economy. Macroeconomics and microeconomics are the two primary branches of economics. Macroeconomics focuses on the big picture side of economics, specifically the decisions made by countries and governments that affect an economy as a whole. Microeconomics, meanwhile, is the study of smaller scale decisions made by people and businesses that affect individual markets. Despite their differences, both branches are interdependent of each other and share many overlapping issues. There are four economics concepts that are key to understanding economic decision making: scarcity, supply and demand, incentives, and costs and benefits. Scarcity refers to the fact that valued resources are limited in quantity. Supply and demand, meanwhile, is the relationship between the price of a good or service and the consumer interest in purchasing it, which, for example, can incentivize producers to increase the supply of goods when demand rises and consumers to limit their consumption of certain goods when supplies are scarce. Lastly, cost and benefit is the dynamic between how much a good or service costs to produce/purchase versus the benefit acquired from doing so. Economics is a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services within an economy. As a field of study, economics is concerned with the economics decisions made by individuals, businesses, governments, and entire nations. In economics, “capital” refers to assets that are themselves used in the production of goods or for providing services. A broad range of items can be considered capital, including tools and machinery, intellectual property, and financial assets. Human capital is a concept used in economics to categorize a worker’s experience, skills, health, and personal attributes that are potentially valuable to a business. Human capital is considered an “intangible asset,” meaning it cannot be listed on the assets portion of a company’s balance sheet. A commodity is a raw material or resource that is considered equivalent with other instances of the same good, regardless of the company producing the items in question. Generally speaking, commodities are things used in the production of other goods or services (e.g., grains, metals, oil, etc.), the quality of which typically differs very little across different producers. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measurement of the value created through the goods and services produced in a particular country within a certain time frame.There are several types of GDP (e.g., nominal, real, per capita, etc.), all of which provide slightly different information about a country’s financial health. The law of supply and demand is an economic theory that defines the dynamic between the price of a good or service and a consumer’s willingness to purchase it. The theory posits that, all else being equal, the price of a good tends to increase when supply decreases or demand increases, and vice versa. In economics, inflation is a measurement of how much the prices of goods and services are rising within a specific economy. Inflation is intended to be reflective of the decreasing purchasing power of a specific currency for a diversified set of products and services. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measurement of the average change in how much consumers have paid for a basket of consumer goods and services within a specific time period. Reported on a monthly basis by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the CPI is one of the most popular tools for measuring inflation.

    "news_title": "Best Online Brokers and Trading Platforms for November 2024",
    "news_content": "Our editors independently research and recommend the best products and services. You can learn more about ourindependent review processand partners in ouradvertiser disclosure. We may receive commissions on purchases made from our chosen links. The best online brokerage platforms provide strong customer support, robust research and analytical tools, a wide range of assets, numerous account types, and more—all with a transparent fee structure and limited gamification tactics regardless of the investment amount. After hundreds of hours of comprehensive research, data analysis, and live broker platform demos, Fidelity Investments is our best overall online brokerage platform for investors due to its low fees, expansive product offering, wide-ranging full-service features, and so much more. Fidelity is just one of 26 online brokers that we evaluated based on 89 criteria, including available assets, account services, user experience, and additional features. When it comes to bringing critical full-service brokerage features, sophisticated tools, and low fees to a wide range of traders and investors, all across continually enhanced platforms, Fidelity reigns supreme for the third consecutive year. Fidelity is ourbest broker for ETFsbecause of its rich exchange-trade fund (ETF)-focused educational content and research tools, expansive ETF offering, and fractional ETF trading. Fidelity is a repeat winner in this category, after earning the top spot from Charles Schwab in 2023. Fidelity has long been an industry leader when it comes to lower fees, and its transparent and compelling fee schedule is the reason why—for the third year running—it wins for low costs. Finding the best brokerage account for cash management is not just about earning the highest interest rate possible. It’s also about seamless integration with critical, no-fee banking features and industry-leading insurance. In these areas, Fidelity’s cash management offering is unmatched, and it comes with solid passive earnings power on uninvested cash, along with reimbursable access to a global network of ATMs. No payment for order flow (PFOF) makes for excellent order execution Strong portfolio analysis and account features Superior trading platforms for all types of investors Top-tier educational content, screening tools, and research capabilities FDIC insurance up to $5 million on uninvested cash Only three digital coins available for trading Minimum balance required for some index trading Multiple platforms may be required to access all tools On Oct. 9, 2024, Fidelity Investments notified customers that that over 77,000 customers had personal information compromised during an August data breach, including Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses. In a notice to affected customers, the company stated \"Between August 17 and August 19, a third party accessed and obtained certain information without authorization using two customer accounts that they had recently established. We detected this activity on August 19 and immediately took steps to terminate the access. An investigation was promptly launched with assistance from external security experts. The information obtained by the third party related to a small subset of our customers. Please note that this incident did not involve any access to your Fidelity account(s).\" In an industry full of innovative companies competing for the attention of an incredibly diverse universe of traders and investors, Fidelity delivers the most well-rounded product offering to suit the needs of nearly every investor. Headquartered in Boston, Fidelity’s storied history began with its founding in 1946. With $5.5 trillion in discretionary assets as of June 30, 2024, the company ranks among the top brokerage firms in terms ofassets under management. Investopedia began evaluating online brokerages in 2019, and Fidelity has shown a commitment to improving its financial products and services ever since. Improvements in financial advisor support, bond liquidity analysis, and the new Fidelity Youth app were the highlights of our 2024 product demonstration with the company. In fact, of the 38.7 million brokerage accounts that Fidelity services, 43% of those accounts were opened by investors 18 to 35 years of age.But the improvements didn't stop there. Fidelity now also has a comprehensive cash management product that is jam-packed with banking features. Fidelity has long been an industry leader when it comes to lowering fees, and it has a stellar reputation as a broker with a huge customer service network, including 210 customer centers, supporting its low-cost, high-value offering. Investors looking for an online broker that keeps costs low, all while delivering some of the most powerful tools in the industry and resisting the common industry practice of collectingPFOF, will be hard-pressed to find a better broker than Fidelity. \"I moved all of our family’s investment accounts to Fidelity in 2021 for one simple, but valuable, reason: It’s the only brokerage firm that offers every single account type we have, allowing me to house all of our investments under the same roof. We have a lot of different account types—from various retirement and taxable accounts, to an inherited IRA, to 529s and custodial accounts, and even an investable HSA. Before consolidating to Fidelity, I had to log into multiple places to check on our various investments. Now, except for a new workplace 401(k), I have one login that shows me everything on a single screen. And when I need customer support, Fidelity advisors can also view things as a whole. Moving to Fidelity has added a lot of ease and efficiency to my financial life.\" - Sabrina Karl, Staff Writer for Investopedia In addition to our review of Fidelity's online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service,Fidelity Go. Even before TD Ameritrade’s educational content was incorporated into its ecosystem, Charles Schwab—which acquired TD Ameritrade in 2020—was known as one of the best platforms for new traders and investors. With the integration now complete, Schwab has taken over top ranks in this category, a position previously held by TD Ameritrade for the past two years. Schwab now houses the most comprehensive library of evergreen learning materials, along with seemingly endless coaching programs and regularly scheduled live training events, making it the best for beginner investors. “If you’re a beginner trader, a user-friendly broker platform will be key. It should be easy to navigate and understand, like using a familiar app. Don’t forget about learning! Look for a broker that offers educational resources to help you understand the market and make informed decisions. Many brokers now offer commission-free trades on stocks and ETFs, so be sure to factor that in as you compare costs.  Consider fractional shares too! They allow you to invest in smaller portions of expensive stocks or funds, a great way to get started without a huge initial investment.” -Amrut Deshmukh, Investopedia Research Analyst Industry-leading educational content Multiple user-friendly platforms Superb ETF research and scanners Over 400 branches in 45 states Access to the highly regarded thinkorswim® platform Relatively high margin rates Low interest earned on uninvested cash Lacks fractional ETF trading No direct investments in cryptocurrencies After Chuck Schwab and his partners formed First Commander Corporation in April 1971, they later changed the company’s name to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. in 1973.Charles Schwab has experienced continuous growth over the years and, in October 2020, completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, with full client integration expected to wrap up in May 2024.Not only does Schwab provide the right mix of usability, tools, education, and research to cater to its diverse customer base, but it does so across multiple top-tier platforms. As of August 2024, Schwab’s total client assets stood at $9.74 trillion. With Schwab’s integration of TD Ameritrade nearly complete, the powerful combination of Schwab’s exceptional lineup of products and services and TD Ameritrade’s powerful capabilities for traders has boosted the company even closer to the top of our comprehensive rating model. One of the most anticipated additions to Schwab's lineup occurred on April 11, 2024, with the company announcing that futures and forex trading, along with a new Portfolio Margin feature, have been made available on its thinkorswim platform.Prospective customers should note, however, that crypto spot trading still isn’t available, but spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are offered. In addition to our review of Charles Schwab’s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service,Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. Interactive Brokers’ lineup of advanced analytical tools, trading technology, and breadth of assets is, quite frankly, awe-inspiring. Ongoing enhancements to legacy platforms like the masterfully constructed Trader Workstation (TWS) and the February 2024 addition of the next-generation IBKR desktop offer just a small glimpse into how Interactive Brokers equips advanced traders to capitalize on fundamental dislocations and pricing inefficiencies better than any other platform we reviewed. This is the third straight year Interactive Brokers has earned this award. “For intraday and advanced traders, speed is everything. Look for a broker with fast execution speeds to ensure your trades go through quickly. In-depth market research is also crucial, so tools and data analysis are important features to consider. Advanced features like algorithmic trading and order routing control can be helpful for active traders looking to automate strategies or optimize order fulfillment. But remember, even the most advanced tools won’t guarantee success—reliability and low costs remain essential for all traders.” -Amrut Deshmukh, Investopedia Research Analyst Simply put, not one of the 26 online brokerage companies we reviewed comes close to offering the scope of global research capabilities, international trading and support access, and currency-based funding variety that Interactive Brokers offers. That's why, for the third straight year, the company is our top broker for international traders. As trading technology continues to advance, so too does the interest in algorithmic trading. Advanced traders will find a powerful lineup of algorithmic trading features in Interactive Brokers’ pre-built algos, a laundry list of API languages, available algorithmic paper trading accounts, and so much more. With its powerful rebalancing features, robust portfolio and risk analysis tools, nearly boundless opportunities for asset diversification, and available access to licensed brokers, investors will be hard-pressed to find a better platform for managing portfolio risk than Interactive Brokers. For professional and retail traders looking for investing and trading ideas across the vast universe of equities, over short-, intermediate-, and long-term time horizons, Interactive Brokers brings together leading industry research vendors, proprietary search tools, and the industry’s largest universe of investable stocks to provide a nearly endless source of ideas that suit every investing and trading strategy. Increasing availability of beginner-friendly platforms Superior order execution Industry-best selection of contingent orders Unparalleled range of investable foreign and domestic assets Powerful and highly customizable professional-level functionality IBKR's SmartRouting not available to IBKR Lite clients TWS can be difficult to learn No in-platform backtesting Often confusing tiered pricing Founded under the name T.P. & Co. in 1978 by its current chairman, Thomas Peterffy, the company pioneered the use of computers in trading. Eventually, Interactive Brokers Inc. was incorporated as a U.S. broker-dealer in 1993, and the company has since developed into one of the industry’s most complete online brokerage platforms. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) offers astonishing access to 150 markets in 34 countries and support for its services in 200 countries and territories, all with funding and trading capabilities in up to 27 currencies. Simply put, this is the broadest global coverage in the industry.As of September 2024, IBKR held just over $515B in client assets. One of the first adopters of technology to the financial markets, both algorithmic and active traders have long regarded the company highly for its advanced trading features, highly customizable tools, low margin rates, andalpha-generating capabilities. Investopedia's team of industry experts is constantly delighted by IBKR’s innovative enhancements that just make so much sense from a purist’s perspective. IBKR’s latest product innovation is IBKR Desktop, a next-generation platform that combines a simple user interface with many of the company’s powerful trading solutions. It features innovations like Option Lattice, a graphical options chain display highlighting potential outliers in key metrics, and MultiSort, which enables users to sort data using multiple factors simultaneously. This idea of simplicity is really where things have been getting interesting for Interactive Brokers, as the company has committed to making its platforms more accessible to beginners. With notable touches like the expansion of educational content across several platforms, including its entry-level IBKR Lite platform; available fractional investing; and the innovative and helpful Options Wizard tool offered on its user-friendly Global Trader mobile app (as well as other platforms), Interactive Brokers is quickly gaining ground on the industry’s top all-around brokerage platforms. In addition to our review of Interactive Brokers' online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service,Interactive Advisors. For the third year in a row, we chose tastytrade as the best options trading platform because of its options pricing structure, which includes options pricing caps that make it the lowest-cost brokerage for high-volume, high-frequency option traders. In addition, tastytrade optimizes tools and content to suit the needs of its options-focused client base. Capped commission structure for options Highly regarded tools for analyzing and monitoring options trades Fantastic options-specific content and educational material Fully customizable trading experience Follow Feed feature allows users to follow trades of tastytrade's TV celebrities No on-platform paper trading support Few investing and retirement resources Lacks some key investment choices like mutual funds  Ask any options trader and they are likely to tell you that this form ofderivativetrading is complex and difficult to master. But with the right guidance, the many options strategies that are available to use can become powerful weapons that allow both traders and investors to benefit from key factors liketime decayand leverage. Created by the same people who developed TD Ameritrade’s highly regarded thinkorswim platform, tastytrade maintains its stance as the best broker for options because of its intuitive delivery of an industry-best mix of comprehensive options-focused tools and content. Launched as tastyworks in 2017 and headquartered in Chicago, tastytrade delivers very competitive fees foroptions trading, including standout features like commission caps for large lot sizes, as well as the absence of any trade commissions when closing positions. Fortunately for tastytrade users, these low commissions come with a platform that continues to undergo enhancements which complement its already powerful delivery of options analytics, platform workflow, trade execution, and valuable digital content. A pioneer in both mobile and online trading, E*TRADE has mastered the art of developing a mobile experience with the right mix of intuitive navigation, robust portfolio and risk management capabilities, deep research, easy-to-digest education, and complex trading tools to cater to investors and traders of all levels. Ongoing enhancements to E*TRADE's mobile capabilities over the past couple of years have caused it to solidify its position as our best mobile trading and investing platform for the first time ever. Excellent range of tools and resources Pre-built and automated portfolio options Educational content library Top mobile apps for traders and investors of all levels Lacks international exchange trading No direct crypto investing Fractional shares only available through a robo-advisor portfolio or dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) Since its founding in 1982, E*TRADE has been at the forefront of embracing innovation that makes for one of the best customer experiences in the industry. Following Morgan Stanley’s acquisition of E*TRADE in 2020, the company has only continued to advance its capabilities by integrating many of Morgan Stanley’s highly regarded research materials, thought leadership insights, and large pool of financial advisors. As one of the largest online brokers in the country, E*TRADE brings an expansive list of investment choices and trading tools to its customer base of 8.2 million households via its website, desktop, and two mobile platforms.E*TRADE’s already vast educational catalog has only grown with the Morgan Stanley integration, complementing the intuitive site design in a way that lets new investors enter the market with confidence. For more experienced investors, the ability to do deep analysis has never been greater than now, when proprietary Morgan Stanley research joins highly regarded third-party research and consensus ratings. While E*TRADE only offers these more advanced traders exposure to cryptocurrencies via Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs and related stocks, traders have access to a wide array of analysis tools, charting functionality, and trading technology to make the most informed decisions in this and many other asset classes. In addition to our review of E*TRADE’s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service,E*TRADE Core Portfolios. In addition to being a user-friendly, multi-asset brokerage platform, eToro shines for its unique social investing feature that enables users to copy other traders’ trades, or receive exclusive perks for sharing their own trading strategies. On September 12, 2024, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that eToro is ceasing trading for nearly all crypto assets. The announcement comes after eToro reached a settlement with the SEC for charges that the trading platform operated an unregistered brokerage and clearing agency related to its crypto dealings. eToro has also agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle with the SEC, in addition to limiting its cryptocurrency offering to just Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ether for U.S. consumers. U.S. customers holding cryptocurrency no longer offered by eToro will be able to sell their cryptocurrency for up to 180 days. Established platform available in over 70+ countries Relatively large selection of tradable crypto assets Innovative and easy-to-use social trading experience Only available in 47 states Very limited account types General lack of advanced trading tools, features, and research No margin trading in the U.S. Options trading only offered to U.S. and U.K. residents via a separate app Originally developed with a focus on forex trading in 2007, eToro eventually transformed and in 2010 created one of the first social trading experiences, called OpenBook.Since then, the company has enhanced this means of enabling users to learn from and copy other seasoned traders across popular asset classes like stocks, ETFs, futures, and crypto. Currently, eToro is only available in 47 U.S. states, but its 25 million-plus users can also find support in more than 70+ countries around the world. eToro recently upgraded its charting capability with the addition of Tradingview’s Pro charts, but the platform still lacks many of the tools, calculators, and detailedorder typesbeyond basic market and limit orders that most sophisticated investors would find necessary to carry out advanced trading techniques. eToro provides real-time pricing information for 3 cryptocurrencies, over 3,000 stocks, and more than 270 ETFs, including spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, covering the most important assets and securities.eToro’s crypto wallet is a separate omnibus wallet with its own address. Users can’t bring in their existing crypto, but they can buy and store it with eToro’s wallet. Additionally, there is no staking available in eToro wallet. While eToro recently added options trading to its asset mix, this functionality is currently offered to U.S. customers via a separate app. However, during our live demonstration with eToro we learned that options trading is currently being piloted in the U.K. and will soon be made available on the main app. Public offers an easy-to-use platform with social networking features, fractional investment capabilities, and a creative selection ofalternative investmentoptions. In addition to stock, option, ETF, and cryptocurrency trading, Public provides a platform for purchasing Treasury bills and alternative investments, like rare sneakers, trading cards, royalties, and more. While Public is our best brokerage for alternative investments and offers a novel mix of alternative investments, it’s important to know that many of these investments are highly illiquid and speculative. That means it may be difficult to buy and sell assets with ease. Available fractional share investing A social media element that connects investors Easy-to-use mobile app No payment for order flow on stocks and ETFs High interest earned on uninvested cash Very limited account types Illiquid and expensive alternative investments Basic educational material Limited features One-leg options strategies only Established in 2019 by Jannick Malling and Leif Abraham, Public offers mobile and web browser-based trading best suited for investors interested in a unique set of alternative assets. The New York-headquartered company is a regulated broker-dealer, withSecurities Investor Protection Corporation(SIPC) protection in each account up to $500,000. Public was developed to help lower the barrier to entry for those who shy away from investing due to a lack of financial literacy, as well as those who lack the means to acquire positions in many expensive financial products. The company has certainly succeeded on this front with its clean and simple user experience; commission trading of stocks, ETFs, and options; $0 account minimum; fractional investing; and social networking element. However, the platform is not without its faults. To begin with, many of the alternative investments offered on the platform are highly illiquid and speculative, and come with high transaction costs. Next, Public does not engage in payment for order flow (PFOF), but it charges an assortment of fees for things like inactivity and instant withdrawals.Investors may also be turned off by the fact that Public requires users to manually opt out of tipping on each transaction, which the company calls “a more transparent, more aligned way to make money” than PFOF.Lastly, Public currently only offers access to individual brokerage accounts. Through our exhaustive research, we found that Fidelity not only outshines the competition when it comes to ETF investing, low costs, and cash management features, but it is also the best online brokerage platform overall. While International Brokers’ ongoing evolution into a more beginner-friendly platform is driving it closer to parity with the industry’s top all-around brokerage platforms, it remains a top choice for advanced trading techniques and risk management, as well as international trading. For traders planning to make options the main strategy they use to reach their investment goals, tastytrade’s platform and market content are hard to beat. Charles Schwab’s integration of TD Ameritrade's educational programs and trading personalities has produced an unparalleled body of actionable learning materials and live training content for beginners. E*TRADE’s long history of enhancing the user experience continues to shine through with its fantastic mobile apps, while eToro and Public bring social trading and networking to the next level as part of their top-rated crypto and alternative offerings. Despitethe sharp increase in volatilitythat rocked the U.S. equity market from mid July through Early August,Investopedia's latest Reader Surveyshows that most individual investors remain somewhat optimistic about their portfolios. Investopedia collected 89 criteria that are critical to investors, from 26 online brokerage companies. We used this data to review each brokerage platform for fees, usability, research amenities, and other key features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their investing needs. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best online brokerage accounts since 2019. Investors choosing an online broker will find a wide range of options, each with varying product offerings, cost structures, and features. The best broker for you will ultimately depend on your individual goals, priorities, and preferences. Some investors may require advanced platforms with access to niche markets and exotic instruments, while others happily settle for a simple, user-friendly mobile app and cost-effective pricing. Whatever your objectives, here are some key factors to consider when choosing an online broker. The commissions and fees your broker charges directly impact your bottom line, and can be a major factor to consider, especially for active traders. Nowadays, with rare exceptions, online brokers offer commission-free stock, ETF, and mutual funds trading, but still charge for options trades. In addition, brokers also generally charge for trading more advanced instruments, like futures, and more exotic asset classes, like cryptocurrencies. The breadth of assets and instruments available to trade determines how flexible your investment portfolio or trading strategies can be. Most online brokers offer trading in stocks, ETFs, and options. A sizable number also provides access to futures and mutual funds. Asmall, but steadily growing groupallows clients to trade cryptocurrencies. Additionally, some brokers now offer fractional shares, which allow investors to buy a portion of high-priced stocks. This feature can be especially helpful for those with smaller accounts, as it makes expensive stocks more accessible. Access to a specific asset class can be a deciding factor when choosing an online broker. Different brokers cater to different trading styles. Whether you manage a long-term stock portfolio, trade complex options strategies, or activelyscalpintraday, make sure the platforms and features offered by your broker complement your style and facilitate your trades. A well-designed, intuitive platform can make trading easier and more enjoyable for traders of all levels, but especially for beginners. In recent years, many online brokers have invested significant time and money into making the user experience as seamless as possible. Advanced platforms, although improving, may still come with a learning curve due to the amount of instruments and the complexity of tools on offer. Research tools help investors make better trade decisions. Among others, this may include access to market data, analyst ratings, charting tools, and latest financial reports. Brokers with robust research capabilities may provide traders an edge by offering quicker access to essential market data. For beginners and experienced investors alike, educational resources are a way to continue improving their knowledge and strategies. A broker offering tutorials, webinars, and in-depth guides can help users stay informed and grow their trading expertise. Other considerations may include account minimums and benefits, supported order types, customer support accessibility, and premium account offerings. Brokers with zero account minimums are more accessible to new investors, while traders with large account balances may benefit from earning interest on unused cash. Active traders will value a broker’s support of complex order types, and those who trade international markets or cryptocurrencies will appreciate the ability to get customer support 24/7. More recently, some brokers also began offering premium accounts - providing additional services or offering better pricing, usually in exchange for a monthly fee. Such accounts may be beneficial to certain investors. This report identifies the best online brokers and trading platforms. It is natural to ask, “How do these brokers and platforms differ from full-service brokers?” One key difference is that online brokers cater todo-it-yourself (DIY) investors. In contrast, full-service brokers aim to relieve you of as much heavy financial lifting as possible by shifting it to their own advisors or affiliated experts. While online brokers harp on their low costs–not just for trades but also low minimums to open accounts and low costs for access to research, tools, and services–full-service brokers boast of the wide range of their offerings. Those include everything from personal financial planning to insurance, estate planning, retirement planning, accounting services, tax advice, and more. Still, the boundary between the two categories of brokers is more and more blurry. Online brokers increasingly offer more services, whilefull-service brokersincreasingly cut costs. In fact, many investors would be hard pressed to explain why some online brokers–especially the larger ones–should not be thought of as full-service firms. Certified financial planner Michael Donnelly, who is account director of corporate relations at the CFP Board of Standards, said, “The financial services landscape has dramatically changed over the past 30 years. Firms that once served specific clients now compete to keep pace with broader client needs and lower-cost competitors. [Full]-service and online brokers have had to expand their offerings and cut costs to stay competitive. As a result, investors benefit from more similar and competitively priced products across the financial planning ecosystem.” A brokerage account is a type of account similar in function to the accounts you have with a bank. With a brokerage account, you deposit funds with an investment firm (the brokerage). This is usually done by a transfer from your existing bank account. Once funds are added to your brokerage account, you can put the money to work using the brokerage's trading platform to invest those funds in the market. The assets you buy with your cash can be anything offered by that brokerage, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and even cryptocurrency. Your online brokerage account will display your holdings (the assets you've purchased) as well as your cash balance (your buying power). If you invest in something that gains in value, you can sell it and the profits will be deposited in your online brokerage account. From there, you can place another trade or even transfer the funds out to your regular bank account to use elsewhere. Some brokerage accounts even allow you to earn interest on your uninvested cash. There is no longer a real minimum to start investing in the financial markets. With many brokers offering margin accounts with access to fractional shares and no required minimums, you can open and fund an account with any amount of money. If you don't have a lot of money to invest, however, it will influence how you approach the market. Although you could invest $1 infractional sharesof a specific stock, the better approach with limited capital is to use ETFs.Index tracking ETFs, for example, offer greater diversification for your dollar than a single company stock because every share (and fractional share) of the ETF replicates an index made up of many companies in many different industries. You could also consider using options to leverage your dollars with a directional bet on the market or a specific stock, but this is a strategy best reserved forrisk capital—not the whole of your limited investment capital. When investing with small sums, consistency is the key to building wealth. If you can regularly put a set amount of money into the market—even $10 a week—you will be surprised at how quickly it begins to grow. This consistency also helps to smooth market effects, as you will be buying dips and peaks as the market goes up and down. Many online brokers allow for small minimum deposits which can be a great alternative for those with limited funds. Account minimums (if any) are displayed at the top of our reviews, as well as in our selection of the best platforms for different types of investors. If you are looking for more general guidance on investing with limited capital, check out our article onsmart investing on a small budget. Some online brokers have powerful mobile apps delivering nearly all the features that their desktop counterparts do. For example, E*TRADE's app, which we picked as our best app for mobile investing and trading, offers two mobile platforms that are streamlined versions of the company's powerful desktop platform. Yes, you can. It is a reality of the market thatno reward comes without risk. You can lose money buying a bad investment, but you can also lose by buying a good investment at the wrong time. Investment decisions should be guided by extensive research and careful consideration of your risk tolerance. When it comes to the financial markets, there are endless possibilities for making and losing money. Unless all the funds in your brokerage account are sitting in uninvested cash (brokerage cash accounts are afforded up to $250,000 of protection bySecurities Investor Protection Corporationinsurance), there is a risk you will lose money. Another way of looking at that, however, is that a brokerage account sitting full of uninvested cash isn't at risk of making any money either. You can use strategies like asset allocation and diversification to reduce the risk of you losing money, but you will never fully eliminate it without also eliminating your chances of making a decent return. Yes, you can actually buy and sell stocks without a broker, but it is not a common approach these days. Some companies still offerdirect stock purchase plansthat allow you to buy shares directly from the company. Companies administer these plans according to internal rules, and some are only open to company employees. You need to contact companies to find out whether they offer a direct stock purchase plan and what the terms and conditions are. These plans initially helped investors avoid brokerage fees, but the rise of online discount brokers with zero fees has removed this barrier, making the direct stock purchase plan somewhat of a relic. An important thing to consider is the distinction betweeninvesting and trading. When people talk about investing they generally mean buying assets to hold long-term. The goal of investing is to gradually build wealth and reach your retirement goals. Conversely, trading involves short-term strategies that maximize returns on a short-term basis, such as daily or monthly. Trading is generally considered riskier than investing. All these factors are worth considering before choosing an online broker. Do you want to trade or invest? Do you want a great mobile app to check your portfolio wherever you are? What types of assets are you looking to invest in? Answering these questions is not always easy. For more support on how to choose a broker, you can check out ourguide to choosing a stock broker. Once you've made a decision on a broker, you can refer to ourguide to opening a brokerage account.

We combined our industry research, subject matter expertise, and investor survey data to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 online broker awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 110 questions to each of the 26 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Feb. 19 to March 19, 2024. We then developed a proprietary model that scored each company to rate its performance across 11 major categories and 89 criteria to find the best online brokers and trading platforms. The score for each company’s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria in the following categories: Additionally, during our 2024 research, many of the companies we reviewed gave us live demonstrations of their platforms and services via video conferencing methods and also granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing.

    "news_title": "Best High-Yield Savings Accounts for November 2024: Up to 5.50%",
    "news_content": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Amanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit. The best high-yield savings account rate from a nationally available institution is 5.50% APY available from Pibank. That's nearly 12 times the FDIC's national average for savings accounts of 0.45% APY.A high-yield savings account is great because it pays more interest, while still giving you the flexibility to withdraw your money when needed. All savings accounts and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Oct. 30, 2024. Every business day, we publish a ranking based on the highest savings account APYs available that day. Below, you'll find our partners' savings and cash management accounts—from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that use partner banks—followed by our top 15 ranking of the best savings account rates available nationwide. The Fedcut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%–5.00% at its Sept. 18 meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means savings rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years. The top savings account rates in the country are listed below in order of APY. Where more than one financial institution has the same rate, we've ranked accounts by those requiring the smallest minimum ongoing balance, and if the same there as well, we list the tied institutions alphabetically. Note that some banks call their savings accounts \"money market\" accounts. Money market accounts traditionally offer the ability to write checks, while savings accounts do not. None of the accounts listed here offer check-writing privileges, even if the name might suggest otherwise. It's smart to also checkour ranking of the best money market accounts, some of which pay comparable interest rates. *Requires a mobile device with face or fingerprint recognition; account unavailable to residents of Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Note:TotalBank is available to customers nationwide except for Florida residents.

Note:Although this account has \"money market\" in its name, it offers no check-writing privileges and instead operates like a savings account. Investopedia collects savings account rates from over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. When ranking high-yield savings account rates, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best savings account, like minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best high-yield savings account rates since 2019. As the name implies, high-yield savings accounts pay much higher interest rates than traditional ones. Often offered online, whether by aninternet-only bankor the online division of abrick-and-mortar bank, they're a type of savings account that's based on the idea of holding your savings wherever it can earn a competitively high yield, even if that's a different bank than where you hold your checking account. The difference in savings account interest rates can be dramatic, with the top accounts in the country typically offering 10 to 12 times the national average rate. And you can still keep your checking account where it is, because it's simple to link ahigh-yield savings accountto your primary account for easy transfers. Stashing some of your cash in a savings account is smart whether you're saving for something specific, or just want to sock money away for when you'll need it in the future. Here are some common reasons to open a savings account: I first opened a high-yield savings account with American Express in 2019, and have urged friends and family to open high-yield savings accounts, too. While Amex doesn't offer the top rate nationwide, it has a great mobile app, which is how I do most of my banking. I can see my high-yield savings account right next to my credit cards, and can easily deposit money from my checking to my savings via the app. ~Hilarey Gould, Editorial Director at Investopedia The amount of money you can earn in a high-yield savings account will be based on how much you deposit, how much you contribute per month, and what your interest rate is. Let's say you start with $1,000 in a high-yield savings account. You have a 5.00% APY and contribute $100 per month. After three months, you'd earn about $13 in interest. After six months, you'd earn about $31 in interest. After 12 months, you'd earn about $77 in total interest and have an ending balance of $2,277. Now, let's say you do the same thing—$1,000 starting balance and $100 monthly contributions—but in a regular savings account. In September 2024, the national average rate for savings accounts was 0.45%, which is still higher than what many big banks pay on savings accounts.U.S. Bank,Chase, andWells Fargo, for example, all pay just 0.1% interest on their traditional savings accounts. For this example, we'll use 0.1% since that is so often what banks pay on savings accounts. After three months, you'd earn about 27 cents in interest. After six months, you'd earn about 62 cents in interest. After 12 months, you'd earn about $1.55 in total interest and have an ending balance of $2,201.55. That's over $75 less than what you could earn in a high-yield savings account. Once you've decided to open up a new high-yield savings account, you'll want to do your homework to make sure you're choosing the best one for your needs. Searching for a topannual percentage yield (APY)is a good starting point when choosing a high-yield savings account, as you'll want to earn a competitive rate. Though the interest rate can change, it makes sense to choose an account that is paying one of the highest rates in the country, since the higher your rate, the more interest you'll collect every month and every year. Also, through thepower of compounding, you can make interest off your interest, and the higher the APY on your account, the better. But beyond the interest rate, you'll also want to make sure the account either doesn't have a minimum balance requirement, or has one that you feel confident you can regularly maintain. Also, note if there is a minimum balance required to earn the top APY. Each bank is a business that has different needs for customer deposits, operating in its own regional market. As a result, some banks have to work harder to attract funds, such as smaller banks with names you may not be familiar with. Also important is the lending activity the bank is undertaking. If, for instance, a bank is in a strategic push to build its commercial lending portfolio, it will need to attract more customer deposits in order to fund those loans it hopes to make. One way they can do this is offering a promotional APY for a short period to boost their deposits balance, but then lowering it after they've accumulated enough funds. When researching high-yield savings accounts to find the best one for you, be sure you understand what these commonly used terms mean. After comparing the best high-yield savings account and landing on a choice, the next step is to open the account online. Here's how that generally works: Once the application process is completed, you may be able to set up online banking right away, or you may need to wait a day or two for your account to be fully opened. Transfers between different institutions will take one to three days to complete, so be sure to keep enough of a cash cushion either in your checking account or in a linked savings account at that same institution. That way you won’t run into trouble if you can’t get funds from your high-yield account for a couple of days. Higher APY than traditional savings accounts Ability to withdraw or deposit funds at any time Extremely safe, with virtually no risk Excellent vehicle for an emergency fund or saving for a big goal In times of rising rates, your APY may go up Earning a top yield may require opening an account with a new institution Some accounts have withdrawal limits of six per month Easy access can make it tempting to dip into savings Account could have a fee or minimum balance requirement In times of decreasing rates, your APY may go down Anyone with surplus savings in the bank can benefit from a high-yield savings account. If you have more money in the bank than you need to hold in your checking account, high-yield savings accounts offer a way to sock some of those funds away to earn an especially highannual percentage yield (APY). High-yield savings accounts are also well suited to those comfortable with internet or mobile banking, as moving money in and out of an online savings account must generally be done on your computer or via a mobile banking app on your phone. When choosing the best savings account for you, you'll want to check the rules of the account, such as whether it limits the number of withdrawals you can make in a month, and if you'll be assessed a monthly maintenance fee. Lastly, check that the bank is an FDIC member (or an NCUA member if it's a credit union) so that your money is insured by the federal government—up to $250,000 per depositor—should the bank or credit union fail. Online reviews of a bank's customer service may also prove useful. High-yield savings accounts are just one vehicle for stashing your cash, and they often pay the highest APYs. But there are several alternatives for holding your funds until you need them. While theeasiestplace to keep surplus funds is in yourchecking account, this has two major downsides. First, money kept in your everyday checking account is very easy to spend, making it difficult to leave earmarked as savings. Second, checking accounts tend not to pay any interest—or if they do, the rate is a pittance. A high-yield savings account offers an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on your money. Somehigh-yield or rewards checkingaccounts do exist, with rates that are more competitive. But these accounts require jumping through some hoops—sometimes every month—in order to earn their high rate. Still, if you're a heavy debit card user, one of thebest rewards checking accountsmay be a good option for you. There is no formal definition of how high a rate needs to be to qualify as \"high yield\". In short, it's up to each institution how to name their savings accounts. Traditional banks and credit unions more often offer traditional savings accounts, while online banks are more likely to offer a high-yield savings account. But again, the distinctions are fuzzy, rather than hard-and-fast rules. Amoney market accountoperates very much like a savings account, with the exception that it allows writing checks. In the past, money market accounts typically imposed high minimum deposit requirements in exchange for higher rates than savings accounts. This has shifted in recent years, however, with savings and money market accounts both having a variety of required minimum balances—including no-minimums accounts. In addition, high-yield savings accounts often pay more competitive rates than money markets, though sometimes you can find a higher APY among thetop-paying money market accounts. If some of your savings can be socked away and not touched for a period of time, you may be able to earn a higher rate with acertificate of deposit. CDs require you to commit your funds to remain on deposit for a number of months or years, imposing a penalty if you request to withdraw the funds before the CD’s maturity date. But in exchange, your interest rate is locked and guaranteed, even if the Fed lowers rates. Our daily ranking of thebest nationwide CDscan lead you to the highest available APYs no matter the CD term you choose. Some people wonder if you can lose money in a high-yield savings account. In a worst-case scenario, a savings account will pay no interest, meaning your funds don't grow at all. But you would never lose the money you put into the account, other than due to fees you've been assessed. So it's important to choose an account where you can easily avoid paying any fees. As for losing money due to a bank failure, the vast majority of banks—whether physical or online—are covered by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which protects banking customers by insuring up to $250,000 of their deposits per institution if the bank fails.The U.S. government similarly backs credit union customers for up to $250,000 by providing insurance through theNational Credit Union Administration (NCUA). That means whether your institution is a traditional brick-and-mortar bank with branches or is an online bank or credit union, and whether it’s big or small, your deposits up to $250,000 are equally safe and protected. The top-paying institutions for savings accounts vary, with no one bank perpetually leading the rate rankings. In general, the top rate contenders tend to be online operations, whether owned by a physical bank or set up as a fully online-only institution. You can always find today's highest rates—currently well above 5%—and the institutions that offer them by regularly checking our ranking in this article. Or for a list that is exclusive to banks (no credit unions), you can check our daily ranking of thebest banks for savings accounts. While it would be nice to earn 7% on money held in savings, no banks or credit unions are paying that much on a regular savings account. The only account paying a 7% APY right now is asavings account for kids, but only on balances up to $1,000.Savings account rates surged in 2023 and 2024, thanks the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike campaign. But at its highest point, the top savings account rate available to anyone in the country reached 5.55% APY in April 2024. We track the savings account rates of over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. While we do check the rates at big banks—including the five largest banks of Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, and U.S. Bank—their rates aren't usually high enough to make our ranking. Meanwhile, other institutions may not qualify for our ranking because they aren't available to customers in at least 40 states, or they significantly limit the balance on which you can earn their high-yield APY. What any bank offers in interest—whether paid on a savings, checking, money market, or CD account—will need to be reported on your annual tax return. You'll be able to see on your monthly statement or online register how much you were paid each month, and at the end of the calendar year, it will be taxed along with all of your other income from employment and other sources. The bank where you hold your high-yield savings account will not tax you directly, but in January of each year, they will send you and the IRS a Form 1099-INT indicating how much interest you were paid in the previous calendar year. You must then report this interest income on your tax return. The APY on a savings account is variable, meaning what it pays when you first open your account will most likely change sometime in the future, and it can change at any time without warning. Whether the rate goes up or down, and how often it changes, is largely influenced by theFederal Reserve. When the Fed adjusts thefederal funds rate, banks and credit unions often follow suit in the same direction. That said, rate changes among savings accounts are not typically a daily or weekly event. Barring recent moves by the Fed, rates often remain at the same level for weeks or months at a time. The risk of losing money in a high-yield savings account is very low. Banks and credit unions are typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Interest rates on high-yield savings accounts are variable, but they are guaranteed based on the balance in the account (the bank won't take that money back after paying it to you). So if you're worried that a high-yield savings account comes with the same risk as investing in the stock market, think again. These accounts are much safer and there's virtually no risk of losing money in the account (unless you spend it of course). There are few drawbacks to putting some of your money into a high-yield savings account. The primary downside is that your money will likely reside at a different institution than where you do your primary banking. As a result, you may not be able to instantaneously transfer money from your high-yield savings to your primary checking account, as transfers between banks generally take 1-3 days. This issue can be easily handled, however, by making sure you keep some level of cash cushion at the bank where you have your checking, enabling you to make a quick transfer to checking if you need it. Every business day, we check the savings account rate for about 100 banks and credit unions that offer their accounts to customers nationwide.

Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of about 100 banks and credit unions that offer high-yield savings accounts to customers nationwide. We determine daily rankings of the top-paying savings accounts first and foremost by the annual percentage rate (APY) offered. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the savings account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms.

    "news_title": "Best CD Rates for November 2024: Up to 5.50%",
    "news_content": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. The best CD rate right now is 5.50% APY available from Nuvision Credit Union for an 8-month term. All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Oct. 30, 2024. Certificates of deposit (CDs)are fixed-interest accounts where you can deposit your money and then withdraw it later. Since 2019, we've been tracking the CD rates of more than 200 nationally available banks and credit unions every weekday, putting the results in our daily ranking of the highest CD yields across every major term. Though we focus on the highest returns available, we also provide you with details on each CD's exact term, the minimum required deposit, and its early withdrawal penalty policy. The Fedcut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%–5.00% at its Sept. 18 meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means CD rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years. Below are the top CD rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found fromour researchthat are available to U.S. customers everywhere. Ranked below are the top 15 or more APYs on nationally available CDs with minimum deposits of no more than $25,000. In the case of ties, we rank them first by the shortest available term, then by the lowest minimum deposit, and finally by the smallest early withdrawal penalty. If there's still a tie, we sort alphabetically by institution name. Want to lock in a great CD rate for a longer term? We rank the top 15 or more APYs daily in every major CD term. You can find those here: *Maximum deposit is $5,000. Highest APY available nationwide by a significant margin Easy path to membership $5,000 maximum deposit limits potential earnings Also offers savings accounts and business banking Competitors have more affordable minimum deposits Low minimum deposit Easy path to membership No physical locations outside of Michigan Low minimum deposit Only one physical location Only $5 required to open CD Harsh early withdrawal penalty Low minimum deposit No physical branches Low minimum deposit Limited physical locations Also offers checking and savings accounts online No locations outside California Full online banking options Branches only in Alabama and parts of Florida Low minimum deposit Limited physical locations *Maximum deposit of $5,000 Low minimum deposit No branches outside Virginia Deposit capped at $5,000 Easy path to membership $10,000 minimum deposit is higher than most competitors Low minimum deposit Harsh early-withdrawal penalty Also offers a competitive savings account CD requires $25,000 deposit Investopedia collects thousands of CD rates from hundreds ofbanksandcredit unionsevery weekday. Whenranking CD rates, we look at factors like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best CD rates since 2019. The CDs we recommend must be available nationwide and these certificates typically pay three to five times as much as the national average—or even more. To be eligible for our rankings, each CD's minimum opening deposit requirement cannot exceed $25,000 and must be offered by an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union (which covers up to $250,000 per depositor). A CD rate is aninterest ratethat shows what a bank or credit union will pay you for depositing your money with them for a certain time in acertificate of deposit (CD). For example, if the rate is 5.50% for a 1-year CD, the bank or credit union will pay you 5.50% in interest on your money for keeping it in the account, untouched, for 12 months. If you deposit $1,000 in that account and keep it there for 12 months, you will earn $55 at the end of the term. The interest rate and theAPY offered on a CDmay be slightly different. An interest rate is the raw rate you earn on your money, while the annual percentage yield (APY) is the full amount of interest earned aftercompoundingat the end of one year. APY is almost always slightly higher than the interest rate. For example, an interest rate on a 3-month CD could be 5.023% while the APY on that same CD is 5.15%. If you invest $10,000 in a CD for one year, you could earn at least a few hundred dollars, depending on the interest rate. For example, with an APY of 5.00%, you'd get $500 in interest after one year. CD rates can change, so locking in a high interest rate today could guarantee you the maximum earnings, especially if CD rates drop by next year. There are a few scenarios you may encounter or need to decide between when it comes to investing $10,000 in a CD. It'll depend on the rate and CD term you choose. Here are a few scenarios: A certificate of deposit (CD) is similar to a bank deposit account. The difference is what you're agreeing to when you sign on the dotted line (even if that signature is now digital). A CD works by locking your deposit up for a set time. When time is up, the CD pays you the set interest rate you agreed to when you opened it. A CD locks you into four specific things: Once your CD is established and funded, the bank or credit union will set the terms and conditions like with most other deposit accounts. You'll get either monthly or quarterly statement periods, paper or electronic statements, and usually monthly or quarterly interest payments deposited to your CD balance, where the interest will compound. The money you put into a CD is insured like other deposit accounts—up to $250,000 per customer, per institution. You typically won't see big names like Chase, Wells Fargo, PNC, Navy Federal, or Bank of America in our rankings of the best CD rates. We research their rates, but they don't make our list simply because they don't pay enough. Extremely large banks typically don't need to attract customers and deposits like smaller institutions do, so they don't need to use rates to win business. In fact, some of the biggest banks pay interest rates very close to zero, but it depends and can change from month to month. Our best CD rates are based on careful research, and we update this article every weekday to give you the best CD rates available nationwide. If you're looking to save money for a certain amount of time and want to make sure you don't touch it until you need it, you should get a CD. If you'rerisk-averseand don't want to invest money in the stock market because there's no guarantee you'll see a return, then you should consider a CD. CDs offer a fixed rate of return that guarantees you earnings when the term is over. And right now, CD rates are high—over 4% and 5% in many cases—so you can earn a decent amount on your deposit. When asked in September where they are investing their money,13% of Investopedia readerssaid they are putting more into CDs, behind ETFs, individual stocks, index funds, and money market funds. In September 2024, inflation was 2.4%, while the top APY offered across all CDs was 5.20%.CD rates reached historic highs in 2023 as a result of the Fed's rate-hike policy to cool inflation, which had reached 9.1% in June 2022.CDs can help you combat inflation by paying you interest on your money, even though you may be paying more for goods and services. This will not always be the case, though. Interest rates are often increased to help combat high inflation. With inflation trending toward the standard 2% mark the Fed aims for each year, the federal funds rate was reduced in September for the first time in four years. CD rates have subsequently begun to decline. Right now, the best CD rates are still over 5.00%, which is much higher than what CD rates were just two years ago. Buying a CD now is a good idea since you'll be able to earn a higher interest rate than you might be able to earn in a year from now. Right now, you're guaranteed a high interest rate, even if the Fed decides to lower rates during the term of your CD. Waiting to buy a CD could mean earning a lower interest rate on a CD and losing out on higher guaranteed earnings. So if you are debating whether to buy a CD or not, don't wait. Online banks or credit unions tend to offer high CD rates because of the lower overhead costs. If you're worried about opening an online bank account, just do your research to ensure the institution comes with FDIC or NCUA insurance. It may also be an online arm of a larger, brick-and-mortar institution, which could give you peace of mind. Big banks likeCitibank,U.S. Bank,Bank of America,Chase,Capital One,Wells Fargo,American Express, and more offer CDs too, but they may not pay the highest CD rates. It's important to shop around and consider all financial institutions before choosing a CD. When choosing a CD, consider the following factors: Once you choose a CD, open the account, and deposit your money to start earning interest. I had two short-term savings goals, so I looked for a 6-month and a 1-year CD with a high APY that I could ladder. I checked out a few of the options on our list and decided to go with CIT Bank and Bread Savings, because applying for the CDs online was really easy, and they offered mobile apps—I’m one of those people who checks their financial accounts frequently, if not daily. I’d keep accounts with both of them (assuming the rates are good when the two terms end). To open a CD, you'll need some personal information including, but not limited to: For example, you may need to provide a copy of your license or ID if you don't have an account with that institution already. When you have that info handy, fill out the application for your CD account: Once you've done all that, you should officially have a CD in your name, though check with the institution to ensure you've taken all the right steps. Smart CD investors have a specific tactic for hedging against rate changes over time and maximizing their return. It's called aCD ladderand it enables you to access the higher rates typically offered on 5-year CDs, but with the twist that a portion of your money becomes available every year, rather than every five years. Here's how to do it. If you withdraw money early from a CD, you'll likely have to pay anearly withdrawal penalty. This is usually a certain number of months' worth of interest that you earned in the CD thus far. For example, if you had deposited $10,000 in a 12-month CD with a rate of 5.00%, and withdrew it early, you might have to pay three months' worth of the interest you had earned. So instead of cashing out $500 at the end of the CD term, you'd walk away with less interest earned, the exact amount depending on how early you withdrew the money. Now, not all CDs have early withdrawal penalties. Someno-penalty CDsare available and have more flexibility, However, they may also come with lower interest rates. Just like how the interest you earn on any money you have in savings, money market, and checking accounts istaxable as interest incomeat both the state and federal levels, the interest you earn on your money in a CD is too. Your CD earnings will be reported to the IRS in the year they were earned and posted to your account, so that's when they're taxable—even though you may not withdraw the funds for one or more years into the future. For example, if you have $1,000 in a 1-year CD with a 5.00% interest rate, you'll earn $50 in interest. You owe taxes on that $50, but not on the $1,000 principal you deposited at the start of the term. If you decide toadd a CD to your IRA, you may not have to pay taxes until you're ready to withdraw in retirement. You can add CDs in both traditional andRoth IRAs. With a Roth IRA, you are not penalized for withdrawing money from the account if it's open for at leastfive yearsbecause it's funded with after-tax dollars. However, if you want to withdraw money from your Roth IRA CD before it matures, you will be hit with a CD early withdrawal penalty. If your CD matures in a traditional IRA before your retirement age, then you may not be able to withdraw that money without first paying taxes and fees. Traditional savings accountstend to offer lower interest rates. Banks or credit unions with no high-yield savings account options may only offer traditional savings accounts that pay 0.01% to 0.10%. While the national average for savings rates is 0.46%, according to the FDIC, many banks pay much less.For example,Wells Fargo's Way2Save accountpays 0.01% APY and Chase offers just0.01% with its Chase Savings account. When interest rates are high, the top CD rate can be up to 600x the rate you may earn on your money in a traditional savings account. If you just aren't sold on committing your funds for a certain amount of time, or can't afford to because you may need the money in the near term, ahigh-yield savings accountmay be a better option. You'll be free to withdraw and deposit funds as you like, though some institutions will limit how many withdrawals you can make each month. Some savings accounts may also require a minimum balance. If you're looking for other high-yield accounts, amoney market accountmay serve your needs. Money market accounts offer the feature of allowing you to write checks on the account. Some money market accounts come with debit cards, but money market accounts tend to act more like savings accounts. They may also come with minimum deposit or balance requirements, and money market account rates can easily compete with savings account rates. If you're interested in venturing out of the bank and into the world of bonds, you have numerous options. You could put cash savings into U.S. governmentI bonds, which are designed to track or beat the inflation rate. Or you could invest in U.S. Treasuries, in which you lend money to the U.S. government for a fixed amount of time. The Treasury notes with durations of four weeks to one year are calledT-Bills. Another option is corporate and municipal bonds. Though it's difficult to research individual bonds on your own, you can easily invest in abond mutual fundorbond exchange-traded fundwhich is diversified across a bundle of different bond issues. You can also enter and exit these funds at any time. If you have a brokerage account, you can also hold savings in the brokerage’s cash reserve account or theirmoney market fund(not to be confused with the money marketaccountsoffered by banks). Just be sure to research what rate you’ll earn because in many cases, these brokerage cash accounts pay far less than what you can earn by keeping your money in an outside CD, savings account, or money market account. Some brokerages may also offerbrokered CDs, another option if you're already investing with a broker and want to open a CD. Anannuityis a type of fixed-income investment provided by financial institutions. You can buy an annuity and pay it monthly or in a lump sum. Then, in the future, you receive fixed monthly payments. Annuities are insurance contracts that can guarantee income. While they are similar to a CD in that the income is guaranteed as long as you follow the rules of the contract, they are not as short-term as CDs may be. Annuities are most often used in retirement planning. CDs can also be used for retirement planning, but they are usually bought and held for terms of 6 months to 5 years rather than an annuity, which could be owned for 20 years or something similar. There may also be different withdrawal rules and limits and tax consequences with annuities. Treasury bills are debt obligations backed by the U.S. government. They usually have maturities of one year or less. That timing is similar to CDs with shorter terms, but Treasury Bills may not offer the same level of return on the investment. Rates are comparable, ranging from 3.98% to 4.78% as of Sept. 26, 2024, but they can fluctuate daily. CD rates can also change daily. The thing with T-bills is that you buy them at a discount and when they mature, you receive the full amount back, plus a little more. For example, you might buy a $1,000 T-bill for $950. When the bill matures, you will get $1,000, or $50 more than what you paid for it. This increase of $50 is the interest you earn. CDs are a little less complicated, where you put in a set amount, and then receive a fixed interest rate when it matures. The highest-paying CD right now is from Nuvision Credit Union with a rate of 5.50% APY for an 8-month term. That could change, though, as interest rates fluctuate daily and institutions can offer CDs with high interest rates for as long or as short of a time as they want. CDs are safe because they are usually offered by banks or credit unions which are insured by the FDIC or NCUA. This means your money at a bank or credit union, across all of your accounts (CDs, savings, and checking, etc.) is insured for up to $250,000. CDs also come with virtually no risk since the interest rate is usually fixed; you'll know what to returns to expect before even opening the CD. The top CD rates have changed over time, from around 1.35% in 2021, to over 5.50% by the start of 2024. This is because CD rates typically follow the trend of the fed funds rate. So when the fed funds rate is low, CD rates tend to be low. When the fed funds rate is high, CD rates tend to be high. To combat high inflation between 2021 and 2023, the Fed raised the fed funds rate. That in turn pushed CD rates higher to 6.00% by 2024. CD interest rates are high right now because they follow the fed funds rate, which is currently set at a target range of 4.75%-5.00%. This is down from the 5.25%–5.50% range it had been at from July 2023 until September 2024. Beginning in 2022, the Fed raised rates from near zero to its recent high to help combat high inflation. With inflation showing signs of cooling, the Fed began lowering rates in September. There are not usually fees associated with the CD that you want to open. However, you may be required to open a savings account at the institution before you can open the CD there. This could require a deposit of $5 or more. Additionally, some credit unions ask new members to make a charitable donation in order to sign up for an account, and this could cost up to $40. CD terms often range from 3 months to 10 years, so you can have your money in a CD for generally any length of time in between. Some CDs have terms of 8 or 9 months, others have 15-month terms, and there are 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, 5-year, 6-year, 7-year, 8-year, and 10-year terms—though the longer terms may be offered by fewer banks or credit unions. Putting money into a CD right now may be a smart move if you're looking to earn a high interest rate on money you don't need. CD rates are over 5.00% for many terms right now, and locking up your money for six, 12, or even 24 months could help you in the long run if CD rates decline in the next year or two. CD rates are higher in 2024 than they have been in 20 years. So yes, now is a good time to buy a CD. A CD with a minimum deposit requirement of $100,000 or more is usually considered ajumbo CD. While the required minimum deposit is higher than traditional CDs, the interest rates on jumbos are not always higher. That means you could earn a higher interest rate by depositing $100,000 in a traditional CD instead of a jumbo CD. Just shop around to learn which CD is best for your money and situation.

than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states.

    "news_content": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. According to our in-depth research of 45 providers, we rankNationwideas the best life insurance company. Life insurance provides money to your loved ones when you die, allowing them to cover your final expenses, replace your income, and pay off your debts. To choose the best providers, we researched 70 criteria, including price, policy types, financial stability, customer satisfaction, and the application process. While Nationwide was the best overall, other top insurers stood out in other categories. Dedicated to helping you find the right life insurance provider for your needs, Investopedia conducts data-driven reviews that are written by life insurance experts who follow stricteditorial guidelines. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best life insurance companies since 2020 with our unbiased, accurate, and comprehensive reviews. Nationwide is an excellent all-around provider of life insurance, with the widest range of product types and coverage limits, plus outstanding customer satisfaction ratings and a very good financial strength rating fromAM Best. On top of that, it offers threeliving benefitriders for no extra charge. Nationwide has no coverage limits on children’s whole life, so you can buy as much protection as you can afford. You can also transfer the policy to your child when they’re grown. And if you buy a child term rider, the policy can be converted to a permanent life insurance policy at adulthood. Besides all of the things that make this a great policy for applicants of any age, we like that Nationwide offers no-medical-exam coverage of up to $1.5 million. It also has a final expense policy with no minimum issue age and a coverage limit of $50,000. Excellent selection of product types Superior financial strength rating (A+) 3 living benefits at no extra cost Great child life insurance features Few customer complaints Doesn’t pay dividends on whole life policies Only sells term life up to age 70 No live chat for customer service Can’t start insurance claims online Whatever kind of life insurance you want, there’s a good chance it’s available at Nationwide. It has one of the widest selections of product types among the insurance companies we reviewed. It's also among the very best providers of riders that let you customize coverage, along with Ameritas and Brighthouse Financial. On top of that, Nationwide has a good customer service record, as shown by itsNational Associations of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint indexand the fact that it was ranked No. 4 out of 22 insurers in the 2024 J.D. Power U.S. Individual Life Insurance Study. In addition, Nationwide policies include free living benefits. Your policy pays out while you’re alive if you develop a critical, chronic, or terminal illness. Nationwide only has a couple of minor flaws. It doesn’t paywhole life dividends. And it only sells term coverage up until age 70. Nationwide was founded in 1925 and is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Available Policy Types Available Riders Banner Life Banner Life Insurance Company’s term life insurance policies have low premiums and terms lasting up to 40 years. Coverage options start at $100,000 and have no upper limit. We like that Banner's term policies are renewable annually, and you can convert them to a permanent plan at no extra cost. The company also lets you get a quote and apply for a policy online. Competitive premiums for term life insurance Sells 40-year term policies No max coverage limit for no-exam policies Limited selection of permanent policies Few riders available No live chat Banner by Legal & General could be a fine choice if you want temporary term life insurance coverage. It has some of the most competitive prices among the companies that gave us quotes, and it allows you to apply online. It is also the only insurer on our list besides Protective Life selling 40-year term policies that can last your entire working life. Most insurers limit you to 30 years. Banner Life falls short on product selection, though. Besides term, it only sells universal life and doesn’t provide manyridersto customize coverage. Banner Life is headquartered in Frederick, Maryland, and its parent company, Legal & General, was founded in 1836. Available Policy Types Available Riders Lafayette Life Insurance With a wide selection of whole life policy options, high coverage limits, and many rider benefits included free of charge, Lafayette Life is our top pick for whole life insurance. Many types of whole life insurance No limit for whole life coverage Pays whole life dividends Includes 3 free living benefit riders No online quotes or application Doesn’t offer universal or variable life Only pays average dividends Lafayette Life is our top choice for whole life insurance policies. It sells seven different whole life products, allowing you to customize your coverage to suit your needs. There’s also no limit on how much whole life insurance coverage you can buy. Finally, Lafayette Life includes many rider benefits at no extra charge, such as riders that let you use your death benefit for medical care while you’re alive if you get a chronic, critical, or terminal illness. While Lafayette Life pays whole life dividends, its dividend interest rate is lower than that of competitors such as MassMutual and Guardian Life. You must also call or meet an agent in person to sign up; you can’t enroll online. Lafayette Life, founded in 1905, is based in Cincinnati. Available Policy Types Available Riders SBLI Life Insurance SBLI combines low premiums for term insurance with a good customer service record, making it an ideal choice for someone on a budget. And it lets you convert your term policy to a permanent plan at no additional cost. Cheap term premiums Excellent online features and tools Few customer complaints No universal or variable life insurance Low whole life dividend rate If you’re looking for a deal on term life insurance, consider SBLI. It quoted some of the lowest overall premiums for term policies of all the companies we researched. Yet SBLI does not appear to skimp on service. It has a low number of customer complaints to state regulators, given its size. At the same time, SBLI offers excellent online capabilities, including online quotes, an online application, and live chat. If you want a permanent policy, SBLI might not be the best choice. It doesn’t sell universal or variable life policies, it has a small rider selection, and it pays a low whole life dividend rate. SBLI was founded in 1907 and is based in Woburn, Massachusetts. Available Policy Types Available Riders Penn Mutual customers can apply for coverage worth up to $10 million without a medical exam, more than any other company we reviewed. High coverage limit for no-exam policies Whole life policyholders are eligible for a dividend and the dividend rate has been high Excellent customer complaint record No online application or quotes No final expense insurance No live chat for customer service Penn Mutual has the highest coverage limit for no-medical-exam insurance among the companies we reviewed. You can get a policy worth up to $10 million through its accelerated underwriting program. The company, founded in 1847 and based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, has paid dividends to policyholders for 175 straight years, reaching a high of $200 million in 2024.The dividend interest rate of 5.75% was among the highest of the companies we reviewed. Penn Mutual has an excellent NAIC index, indicating that customers have made few complaints relative to the company's size. But if you want to shop for life insurance online, Penn Mutual doesn't offer the digital quoting and application features that many of its competitors do. You need to speak to an agent to buy its products. And while it has a wide product selection, it doesn't sell smaller, more affordable policies to cover final expenses. Available Policy Types Available Riders Thrivent Thrivent received an A++ rating from A.M. Best for its financial strength, the highest score possible. But Thrivent is a member-owned organization for Christians. It asks that only Christians or their spouses apply. Thrivent had the best three-year average score for customer complaints to state regulators of any of the companies we researched—though MassMutual is a very close second. Thrivent’s average NAIC index was 0.73, far better than expected for a company of its size. MassMutual’s was 0.75. (An index of 1.0 indicates a company received about as many complaints as expected for its size.) A++ financial strength rating Best complaint score of any company we reviewed Good policy selection Only available to applicants who declare themselves Christians No online applications Limited rider selection No child term rider AM Bestreviews insurance companies based on their financial strength. It gave Thrivent an A++ rating, the highest score possible. This shows that Thrivent is in an excellent position to pay out its claims and benefits. Thrivent also excels at satisfying customers. Of the more than 40 companies we reviewed, it received the fewest customer complaints relative to its size. Thrivent offers a broad range of life insurance types, including term, whole life, and universal. Still, the company has a few drawbacks. The main one is its limited membership—it is only open to Christians. Also, you can’t apply for policies online and must speak with an agent. Thrivent has fewer riders than other top competitors and is noticeably missing a child term rider. Thrivent was founded in 1902 and is located in Minneapolis. Available Policy Types Available Riders Pacific Life Pacific Life's universal life insurance (UL) selection stands out because the company offers all the main variations of UL (indexed universal, variable universal) and multiple product choices for each one. There’s also a large group of riders to choose from and the UL coverage range is wide, with policies as small as $25,000 and essentially no maximum limit. Finally, we like that you can also add a child term rider to UL policies. Sells all the variations of universal life No maximum coverage limits Great customer satisfaction rating No online quotes or applications No whole life insurance Pacific Life specializes in more complex universal life insurance policies. It sells all three main variations: universal, indexed universal (IUL), and variable universal (VUL). Only a few other insurers, such as Nationwide, Prudential, and John Hancock, offer all three, and often they can’t match Pacific Life’s variety of product offerings. In some markets, Pacific Life has two different UL products, five VUL products, and four IUL products. However, Pacific Life requires you to meet a representative in person to discuss these complex products; you can’t apply online. Pacific Life also does not sell whole life insurance. Pacific Life launched in 1868 and is based in Newport Beach, California. Available Policy Types Available Riders Symetra Symetra sells policies worth up to $5 million that don’t require a medical exam, with rapid approval decisions. High limit for no-medical-exam life Fast underwriting decisions High customer satisfaction Limited policy types Small rider selection If you don’t want to take a medical exam, Symetra is another fine choice. You could qualify for up to $5 million of coverage with no exam, provided you can pass based on age, income, and medical records. Symetra lets you apply online and can make coverage decisions in minutes. While Symetra can be great for no-exam term life, it doesn’t offer much choice beyond that. It doesn’t sell whole life insurance or many policy riders. Symetra was founded in 1957 and is based in Bellevue, Washington. Available Policy Types Available Riders Protective Life Protective offers the best term rider for covering children, making it a solid choice to protect your entire family at once. Extensive coverage for child term rider Whole life policies available with a death benefit as small as $1,000 Sells 40-year term life No children’s whole life policies All applications require a medical exam No dividends for whole life policies A child term rider adds insurance for your children to your life insurance policy. While other insurers offer this benefit, Protective stands out for having the best. Its rider covers your children until they turn 25. Your children can also take over the life insurance when they become adults and convert the temporary term insurance into permanent lifetime coverage. However, Protective Life does not sell a standalone child’s whole life policy. If you want to cover your child, you can only do so through a rider. Beyond child coverage, Protective has a wide selection of policies and riders. Protective Life launched in 1907 and has its headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama. Available Policy Types Available Riders MassMutual MassMutual stands out for paying the highest whole life dividend rate, helping grow the cash value for policyholders. Generous whole life dividends Sells whole life up until age 90 Great customer satisfaction rating No online quotes or applications Applications require a medical exam No same-day decisions MassMutual is another solid option for a whole life insurance policy. It pays the highest dividend rate of all insurers on this list, giving policyholders solid risk-free growth for their cash value. MassMutual also sells whole life policies to people up to age 90, tied with Thrivent and Guardian Life for the highest age limit. You can't apply online to take out a MassMutual policy; you must talk with an agent. All applications require a medical exam, and there are no same-day decisions. MassMutual launched in 1860 and is based in Springfield, Massachusetts. Available Policy Types Available Riders All the companies on our list could be good for your coverage. The right option depends on what you’re looking for. Nationwide is our pick for best overall insurer thanks to its product selection, and it stands out as a top choice for covering children and people over 50. Protective Life is also a quality option for children’s life insurance, thanks to its child term rider. If you want temporary term coverage—meaning for a few decades instead of your whole life—Banner Life has the best overall term policies, while SBLI charges the cheapest term premiums for most people. If you want permanent coverage, Lafayette and MassMutual are great options for whole life, while Pacific Life is best for universal. If you don’t want to have to take a medical exam while applying, consider Penn Mutual or Symetra. Finally, Thrivent stands out as the most financially stable, per the AM Best ratings, and it has the best customer satisfaction rating of all the companies we researched. There are many types of life insurance, with differences based on how long the coverage lasts, the application process, and whether you get anyliving benefits(access to your cash value while you’re alive. Here are the main types on the market: Term life insuranceis temporary coverage. You buy a policy that lasts a set amount of time, such as five or 20 years. If you pass away during the term, your heirs receive the death benefit. If you outlive the term, your coverage ends. Term life insurance is the most affordable option. However, it is not guaranteed to last your entire life and doesn’t provide cash value. Whole life insuranceis guaranteed to last your entire life, provided you keep paying the premiums. The premiums are also guaranteed not to increase. Whole life insurance can build cash value with a guaranteed minimum return plus company dividends. Whole life insurance is more expensive than other policy types. Universal lifeis another type of permanent policy that can offer lifelong coverage. With universal life, you can change the premium payment each year. However, you must pay enough to keep up with life insurance costs. These policies give more flexibility but require more work to manage. Universal life insurance policies also build cash value. Regular universal life insurance grows based on market interest rates. Your returns are somewhat unpredictable, though there is a minimum guaranteed return. Indexed universal life insurancegrows your cash value based on the performance of some market index, like the S&P 500. However, there are limits on your possible gains and losses. Many IULs guarantee a minimum return in market downturns but cap your growth in good years. Variable universal lifeandvariable lifeboth let you invest in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. You have more upside potential than the other life insurance types but could lose money in your cash value during downturns. A VUL policy lets you adjust the premium payments yearly, whereas variable life charges steady premiums. No-medical-exam life insurancelets you apply for and potentially buy life insurance without getting a physical exam first. Instead, insurers decide to approve you based on other information like your medical and prescription records, driving record, and answers to questions on the application. No-medical-exam life insurance has a faster, easier application process. However, there could be limits on the coverage amounts and policy types. In addition, premiums can be higher for some kinds of no-medical-exam life insurance, likeguaranteed issueburial insurance, because they accept people with health issues. Life insurance costs depend on several factors, including the amount of coverage, features and benefits, your age, gender, overall health, family medical history, lifestyle, and the insurer you work with. You’ll need to apply to see preciselyhow much life insurance costsfor you. The type of coverage you buy also makes a big difference. Permanent policies like whole life insurance typically charge more than term life insurance policies for the same death benefit because the policy doesn’t expire as long as you pay your premiums, and it has a savings component (cash value) that grows as you age. Here are quotes from the top insurers in this article. As you age, the price of life insurance goes up. Older adults will usually get shorter terms, but still pay higher premiums than younger adults getting a longer term. The information below is for a 15-year term, versus the 30-year term quoted above. You shouldn’t work with just any company for your life insurance coverage. Follow these steps to make sure you do the right amount of research. For more help, check outhow to choose the best life insurance company. Investopedia collected data points related to dozens of criteria that are important when choosing life insurance, across 45 companies. We used this data to review each company for financial stability, customer satisfaction, coverage options, cost, and other features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews that can help you make the right decision. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best life insurance companies since 2020. We are dedicated to helping you find the right life insurance provider for your needs. Life insurance provides financial protection for your death. When you sign up, you pick how much coverage you want. If you die while covered, the insurance company pays your heirs thedeath benefit. You must pay ongoing premiums to keep your life insurance policy active. You mayneed life insuranceif you have people depending on you, like a spouse or young children. It could replace your salary if you pass away unexpectedly. You may also need life insurance if you have large debts you’d like to cover for your family, like a mortgage, student loans, or final expenses. Finally, if you own a business, you could buy life insurance to protect your partners and cover the lives of key employees. If you don’t have these needs now, consider whether they could come up in the future. You could set up life insurance to prepare now. The main pro of life insurance is that it can protect your heirs against the cost of your death. You can buy a large amount of coverage for a small premium using term life. Life insurance can also build wealth for the future using cash value. The main con of life insurance is that it costs money. You must pay the premiums to stay protected. It’s possible to pay years of premiums and not receive a death benefit payout because your coverage ends before you pass away. Some permanent policies may also not be the best use of your funds. You may be better off getting an affordable term policy and investing the rest of your money rather than paying for a more expensive permanent policy. You can get cheap life insurance by buying term life insurance, which is much more affordable than permanent coverage. You can focus on companies such as SBLI or Banner Life, which specialize in inexpensive policies. Get multiple quotes to see who offers you the best deal. Burial insuranceis a type of life insurance specifically designed to pay for funerals and other final expenses. These are whole life policies without an expiration date. Burial insurance is usually for small amounts of coverage, just enough to cover the cost of a funeral.These policies typically have easier underwriting without checking for health issues. However, they can be more expensive than regular life insurance for some buyers and can have limits on paying out if you pass away within the first few years of buying coverage.

For each of those, we then gathered a total of 70 evaluation criteria, resulting in 3,150 data points all together. Data was collected between May 20 and July 3, 2024, and sourced from company webpages, media representatives, third-party rating agencies (A.M Best, NAIC, and J.D. Power), and customer service calls.

    "news_content": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. The best money market account rate is 5.00% APY at Quontic Bank. That's nearly eight times the FDIC's national average for money market accounts of 0.61% APY, and is just one of 15 or more top rates you can find in our rankings below. Money market accounts act very similar to high-yield savings accounts, with one major difference: you can write checks from the account. All money market accounts and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Oct. 29, 2024. Every business day, we track down the highest money market account rates available that day. Below, you'll find our partners' savings and cash management accounts—from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that use partner banks—followed by the best money market account rates available nationwide. Money market accounts are not the same thing as money marketfundsor money marketmutual funds.Those are investment-type accounts typically offered at brokerage firms, and their value can go up and down. In contrast, the money marketaccountsfeatured here are offered by banks and credit unions, and they operate as a hybrid between savings and checking accounts. Aside from any fees you incur, your funds cannot lose value. The best money market account rates in the country are listed below in order of APY. In cases where more than one institution has the same rate, we've ranked accounts by the size of their minimum balance requirement, with smaller requirements ranking higher on the list. These are the top contenders if you want to be able to write checks from a savings account. But if check-writing is not critical to you, you may find a better-paying option in ourdaily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts. Notes: Online accounts from Brilliant Bank are not available to residents of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. This account will pay its top APY on a maximum balance of $500,000. Amounts over that will pay a significantly lower APY. Note: The Digital Money Market account is not available to customers in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, or Michigan. Note:This account will pay its top APY on a maximum balance of $100,000. Amounts over that will pay a significantly lower APY. Note: This account will pay its top APY on a maximum balance of $100,000. Amounts over that will pay a significantly lower APY. The Fedcut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%–5.00% at its Sept. 18 meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means money market account rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years. A money market account is a type of bank account that pays a better interest rate than what you can earn on the money in your checking account (which typically pays no interest) or in a regular savings account. That makes it a great place to move some of the funds that you don't need on an everyday basis, boosting the amount of interest you earn over the course of each month. Money market accountsare smart for anyone who wants to earn a high-yield interest rate, but also wants check-writing privileges. Though you may not be able to find a money market APY quite as high as thebest savings account, you can often get close, while adding an additional way to withdraw your funds. Interest rates on money markets are variable and can change over time. They are not fixed like with a CD. They are more like a savings or checking account where the rate is variable and the account isliquid. That means you can deposit and withdraw funds more or less as you choose. But unlike a savings account, money market accounts give you the option to write checks, making them a sort of hybrid between savings and checking accounts. Don't assume that because an account has the words \"money market\" in its name that it is a true money market account with check-writing privileges. In recent years, financial institutions have started to use the phrase \"money market\" as a marketing term, sometimes applied to accounts with no check-writing abilities and therefore they are essentially high-yield savings accounts. Your balance earns interest Withdraw and deposit when you like Offers virtually risk-free safety If rates rise, your APY could increase Scoring a high APY may require opening an account at another bank Easy access to your money can make it tempting to spend If rates drop, your APY could be lowered \"Though there’s no way to know how much the Fed will ultimately lower rates—or how long they’ll keep cutting—we’re likely to see at least one more rate reduction this year, and then more cuts next year. That could lower the Fed rate a full percentage point or two, which would push rates on money market accounts down by a roughly similar amount.\" ~Sabrina Karl, Investopedia Staff Writer A money market account pays interest, just like a savings account. Money market accounts tend to pay higher rates than traditional savings accounts; their rates are on par with high-yield savings account rates. Here's an example of how much you could make in a money market account compared to a traditional savings account if you were to deposit $1,000 and then contribute $250 per month for one year: You could earn $120.64 more in interest in a money market account compared to a traditional savings account. The best money market account for you will be one that pays a competitive interest rate and has account requirements that will work for you. Some of the account features you'll want to consider are: To determine which of the factors above are the most important to you, think about how you expect to use the account, such as the minimum balance you feel confident you can maintain and how often you'll want to take funds out of the account. If you've never opened an account somewhere other than your primary bank or credit union, you may worry that top-paying small institutions or online-only banks are riskier, or that it will be inconvenient. Fortunately, your funds are as protected as they are at anyfederally insured institution, regardless of size or whether it has branches. And though transferring funds between institutions can take one to three days, today's online banking systems make transfers very easy. Once you've decided which money market account is best for you, opening the account should be pretty straightforward and will follow the same process as opening a savings or checking account. Wondering why these accounts are called money markets? It has to do with their highly accessible funds, which can be turned into cash very quickly. Hence the term \"money market.\" Here are a few additional options to consider instead of, or in addition to, putting funds in a money market account. For money you know you won't need access to for a while, also consider one of the options in our daily ranking of thebest nationwide CDs. You may be able to earn a higher APY than with a savings or money market account, and your rate will be locked for the full duration of the CD term. Investopedia has been researching bank deposit rates from over 200 nationwide banks and credit unions every weekday since 2019. We have been publishing our ranking of the best money market accounts since 2021. When ranking money market accounts, we ensure the institutions meet our requirement of being federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA, and we research the basic account features, such as minimum required balances, any fees, and other factors that will help readers choose the account that will best meet their needs. Launched in 1999, Investopedia has been helping readers find the best savings account and CD rates since 2019, and the best money market accounts since 2021. Money market accounts are an exceptionally safe place to keep your funds. First, every money market account in our rankings is federally insured by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)—or for credit unions, theNational Credit Union Administration (NCUA)—with coverage up to $250,000 per depositor and per institution.FDIC and NCUA insurance works exactly the same regardless of the size of the institution. So banking with a bigger or smaller bank does not change your risk for deposits up to $250,000. Second, even if your money market account is offered by an online bank, you'll have federal protection there, too. If the bank is simply an online division of an existing brick-and-mortar bank that's FDIC-insured, then the online division is also protected. And even if the bank isinternet-only, it likely is an FDIC member as well. Third, money market accounts are not investments—they are simply deposit accounts. So the money you put in always belongs to you and cannot lose value, aside from any banking fees you may be charged. A money market generally isn't a substitute for your checking account because many money market accounts limit how many transactions you can make in a month. In addition, not all money market accounts offer ATM or debit cards. Though the federal regulation limiting withdrawals to six per month wassuspended in 2020, many banks and credit unions still impose withdrawal limits. That's because reducing the transactional costs of these accounts is what enables the bank to offer a higher interest rate. (Note, however, that ATM and in-branch withdrawals are always unlimited.) Some money market accounts do offer unlimited withdrawals of all types. So if that's important to you, be sure to research account features before making a final choice. A good money market account rate is anything over 4.00% right now. The rate on a money market account is variable and can change over time. Across 2022 and 2023, rates surged due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive inflation-fighting campaign, resulting in the top money market accounts paying over 5.00%. But before the Fed's campaign, the best rates were less than 1%. What the future holds for money market rates is unpredictable, but if you shop from our daily ranking, you'll know you're choosing from the best currently available rates. Your earnings from a money market account depend on the average daily balance you hold in the account and the exact APY your account is paying. But we can make an estimate of what you'd earn if we assume an interest rate of 5.00% APY. On a $10,000 balance held in the account for one year, your earnings would be approximately $500, or roughly $41 per month. If you're lucky enough to have a $100,000 balance in the account, your earnings would be about $5,000 for the year, or about $416 per month. You don't pay taxes on the money you deposit into a money market account, but instead, on the interest you earn. Interest earned in money market accounts, savings accounts, CDs, and high-yield checking and savings accounts is subject to taxes when it's a total of $10 or more. The biggest drawback to putting your savings in a money market account is that the rate is not guaranteed. What you earn will be at the mercy of general interest rate fluctuations, so your money market rate can be expected to fall once the Federal Reserve starts lowering the federal funds rate. In contrast, money put in a CD will earn a fixed and guaranteed rate until the end of the certificate's term. Some money market accounts put a limit on the number of withdrawals you can make. If you choose one of these accounts with restrictions, a downside could be that you're not able to withdraw funds as freely each month as you may like. For those with a lot of cash on hand that they want to keep liquid while still earning a return, there are various ways to have more than $250,000 covered by federal FDIC insurance. The easiest is by holding your deposits in more than one name (like yours and your spouse's), in more than one FDIC institutions, or both. The FDIC coverage limit applies per person and per institution. So that means if you and your spouse each have accounts at an FDIC bank (in your own names, not jointly held), you would have coverage up to $500,000. Alternatively, if you want to keep all the funds in your own name, you can put up to $250,000 in more than one bank. Just remember: All your deposit accounts at a bank count toward the same $250,000 limit, so you'll need to tally up your balances of checking, savings, CD, and money market accounts to know how close you are to the $250,000 cap. Money market account rates are variable and can change over time. Like with savings and CDs, they are influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. When the fed funds rate is high, money market accounts are more likely to be high. When the fed cuts rates, they are likely to decline. With the Fed expected to make rate cuts in both 2024 and 2025 now that inflation is under control, money market account rates will be lower in 2025 than they were in 2023 and 2024. We regularly review the rates of the following FDIC banks and NCUA credit unions: 5Star Bank, All America Bank,Ally Bank, Amalgamated Bank, American Heritage Credit Union, BankUnited, Bellco Credit Union, Bethpage Federal Credit Union, BluPeak Credit Union, Brilliant Bank, Chevron Federal Credit Union,CIT Bank, ConnectOne Bank, Connexus Credit Union, Dept of Commerce Federal Credit Union, Digital Federal Credit Union,Discover Bank, EverBank, Finworth, First Capital Bank, First Foundation Bank, First Internet Bank, Forbright Bank, Genisys Credit Union, Hanscom Federal Credit Union, Hughes Federal Credit Union, Ideal Credit Union, KS StateBank, Latino Federal Credit Union, Luana Savings Bank, Merchants Bank of Indiana, Mountain America Credit Union, MutualOne Bank, My eBanc, MYSB Direct,Nationwide by Axos, nbkc bank, Northern Bank Direct, Northpointe Bank, Pen Air Credit Union, PenFed Credit Union, Presidential Bank, Prime Alliance Bank, Princeton Federal Credit Union, PSECredit Union,Quontic Bank, Redneck Bank, Republic Bank of Chicago, Sallie Mae Bank, Seattle Bank, Self-Help Federal Credit Union, Spectrum Federal Credit Union, Summit Credit Union, Synchrony Bank, TAB Bank, The Federal Savings Bank, UFB Direct,U.S. Bank, USAlliance Financial, Utah First Federal Credit Union, Webster Bank, and Zeal Credit Union. Every business day, Investopedia researchers and fact-checkers track the rate data of more than 60 banks and credit unions that offer money market accounts to customers nationwide, resulting in a daily ranking of the top-paying money market accounts. To qualify for our list, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. The account also must allow check-writing. Banks and credit unions must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms.

    "news_title": "Compare the Best Mortgage Rates Today - Oct. 30, 2024",
    "news_content": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. As of Oct. 30, 2024, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.88%, 20-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.85%, 15-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.05%, and 10-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.04%. Average rates for other loan types include 5.39% for an FHA 30-year fixed mortgage and 6.86% for a jumbo 30-year fixed mortgage. These fixed-rate loan averages are not the teaser rates you may see advertised online. To find theaverage mortgage ratestoday, we use data from approximately 40 lenders, assuming a down payment of at least 20% and an applicant credit score in the 680–739 range. We believe this is more representative of what customers could expect to be quoted, depending on their qualifications. Our daily mortgage rate averages are based on data from Zillow Group Marketplace. As this involves a different rate source and methodology, the averages will not directly align with those we published prior to May 1, 2024. All the historical data and analysis in this article and future articles is also based on this new data source. Our mortgage rate table is designed to help you compare mortgage rates for the type of home loan you’re being offered by lenders to know if they are better or worse than the best rates available. These rates are benchmark rates for those with good credit, not the teaser rates that make everyone think they will get the lowest rate available. Of course, your personal credit profile will be a significant factor in what rate you get quoted, but you will be able to begin comparison shopping for either new purchase or refinance rates with confidence before you choose a mortgage lender. A 30-year mortgage is a conventional home loan that offers a fixed rate for a 30-year term. This means that your monthly payments, consisting of the principal and interest, remain the same throughout the lifetime of the loan. Some 30-year mortgages are government-backed loans, such as the ones from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA). Most borrowers choose a 30-year mortgage because it has lower monthly loan balance payments compared to other terms, freeing up room for other financial goals. According to Freddie Mac, this is the most popular type of mortgage, with almost 90% of homeowners opting for a 30-year term. People looking to buy a home who want the lowest possiblemortgage paymentsgiven record-high home prices should consider a 30-year mortgage. Although it may come with a higher interest rate compared to other home loan terms, monthly mortgage payments are lower because they are extended over a long term. Every Thursday, Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored buyer of mortgage loans, publishes a weekly average of 30-year mortgage rates. The latest reading is 6.08%—the lowest weekly average since September 2022. Freddie Mac's average last October reached a historic 23-year peak of 7.79%. Freddie Mac’s average differs from what we report for 30-year rates because Freddie Mac calculates aweeklyaverage that blends five previous days of rates. In contrast, our Investopedia 30-year average is a daily reading, offering a more precise and timely indicator of rate movement. In addition, the criteria for included loans (e.g., amount of down payment, credit score, inclusion of discount points) varies between Freddie Mac's average and our own. Like a conventional 30-year mortgage a 20-year mortgage is a home loan with a fixed rate but with a shorter 20-year term. Monthly payments, consisting of the principal and interest, remain the same throughout the term of the loan. The main benefit of a 20-year mortgage is the savings homeowners receive from lower interest rates and paying it off sooner than 30 years. Any homeowner who borrows money to benefit from lower interest rates and pay off their mortgage sooner than later should consider a 20-year mortgage. In general, 20-year mortgage rates are lower than 30-year ones, helping to reduce the payments of interest over the course of the loan. However, a 20-year mortgage pays the loan off faster and thus has a higher monthly obligation. Homeowners should factor in higher costs to their monthly budget when it comes to choosing a 20-year mortgage, although it is still less than what a 15-year mortgage would require. A15-year mortgageis a fixed-rate loan to pay for a home purchase. The monthly payment, which includes principal and interest, remains the same throughout the lifetime of the mortgage. It is paid off in half the time of a traditional 30-year mortgage. The shorter repayment period and the higher monthly payments result in a savings of thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the loan although monthly payments are higher compared to longer-term mortgage loans. A 15-year mortgage is a smart option for borrowers who want to save money on interest and can afford larger monthly payments without compromising their other financial goals and responsibilities. For instance, a borrower who can't take out a 15-year mortgage without sacrificing regular contributions to a savings account and a retirement fund should probably stick to a longer-term mortgage. A 20-year term can offer a happy medium. For borrowers who have variable or sporadic incomes, a 15-year mortgage makes sense only if there is a realistic plan to make the mortgage payment through the lean periods. A 10-year mortgage is the shortest fixed-rate loan available for a home purchase. As with longer-term mortgage loans, the monthly payment remains the same throughout the lifetime of the mortgage. It is paid off in one-third of the time of a traditional 30-year mortgage. The abbreviated period results in much lower interest being paid over the life of the loan but involves higher monthly payments vs. longer-term mortgage loans. The major benefit of taking out a 10-year fixed-rate mortgage is that homeowners can pay off their loans much faster than other loan terms. Since rates may be lower than a 20- or 30-year term and because homeowners are making fewer payments, borrowers will save the most money on interest with a 10-year term. Plus, homeowners will be able to build equity much faster. Homeowners who want to pay off their mortgage quickly and have the means to pay the large monthly payment should consider a 10-year mortgage. Also, since lenders may view these types of borrowers as more high-risk (since you’ll need to pay more each month), you’ll most likely need to have an excellent credit profile to qualify. A 10-year home loan is also best for those who want torefinance their mortgageand have been paying down their existing loan for a while. For instance, those who have close to 10 years until they’re mortgage-free may not want to refinance to a loan with a longer term. That is, unless you’re looking to refinance to a longer term to lower payments—keep in mind you’ll end up paying more in interest in the long run if you go with the longer loan term. Trends in mortgage rates are influenced by complex factors, such as the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy, employment rate, the Consumer Price Index, and the yields of 10-year treasury bonds. Mortgage rates are not directly tied to any of these factors but are indirectly influenced by their current levels and consensus predictions on how they will trend in the near future. Mortgage rates are determined by a complex interaction of macroeconomic and industry factors, such as: Because any number of these can cause fluctuations simultaneously, it's generally difficult to attribute the change to any one factor. Macroeconomic factors kept the mortgage market relatively low for much of 2021. In particular, the Federal Reserve had been buying billions of dollars of bonds in response to the pandemic's economic pressures. Thisbond-buying policyis a major influencer of mortgage rates. But starting in November 2021, the Fed began tapering its bond purchases downward, making sizable reductions each month until reaching net zero in March 2022. Between that time and July 2023, the Fed aggressively raised thefederal funds rateto fight decades-high inflation. While the fed funds rate can influence mortgage rates, it doesn't directly do so. In fact, the fed funds rate and mortgage rates can move in opposite directions. But given the historic speed and magnitude of the Fed's 2022 and 2023 rate increases—raising the benchmark rate 5.25 percentage points over 16 months—even the indirect influence of the fed funds rate has resulted in a dramatic upward impact on mortgage rates over the last two years. The Fed maintained the federal funds rate at its peak level for almost 14 months, beginning in July 2023. But on Sept. 18, the central bankannounced the first rate cutin what's expected to be a series of decreases in 2024 and likely 2025, which should exert downward pressure on mortgage rates. This first reduction was by 0.50 percentage points. The Fed's next rate announcement will be made Nov. 7. A mortgage is a type of loan used to purchase or maintain a home, land, or other types of real estate. The borrower agrees to pay the lender over time, typically in a series of regular payments divided intoprincipalandinterest. The property then serves ascollateralto secure the loan. Individuals and businesses use mortgages to buy real estate without paying the entire purchase price upfront. The borrower repays the loan plus interest over a specified number of years until they own the propertyfree and clear. Most traditional mortgages arefully amortizing. This means that the regular payment required will stay the same, but different proportions of principal vs. interest will be paid over the life of the loan with each payment. Typical mortgage terms are for 30 or 15 years. There are numerous types of mortgages in the mortgage market, including those from private mortgage lenders as well as government-backed loan programs that purchase, guarantee, and securitize mortgages in the secondary mortgage market like those by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), known asFHA loans, or theFederal National Mortgage Association(Fannie Mae). A conventional mortgage can be fixed-rate with terms varying from 10 to 30 years or an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) with terms up to 10 years.Jumbo mortgage loansthat exceed the Federal Housing Finance Agency'sconforming loan limitof $766,550 for 2024 cannot be purchased, guaranteed, or securitized by Fannie Mae or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).Jumbo loansoffer the same fixed and variable rate terms asconventional mortgage loans, though their interest rates are typically lower. While most mortgage originations occur in the private market, government-backed mortgages occupy an important niche and provide access to first-time homebuyers and borrowers who could not otherwise qualify or afford the terms of traditional mortgages. Government-backed loans like FHA loans, state FHA loans,USDA loans(USDA guaranteed loans), andVA loans(backed by the Department of Veteran Affairs) can offer significant advantages to qualifying borrowers, including lower interest, longer terms, and a lower percentage of down payment (or no down payment) compared to conventional loans. For these types of loans with lower down payment options, the borrower can be required to acquire private mortgage insurance (PMI). The advertised rate or nominalinterest ratefor a loan, whether for a mortgage, personal loan, or credit card, is the basic cost of borrowing the principal stated as a percentage. Theannual percentage rate(APR), reflected as a percentage, is the total cost of the loan, including the fees and all other costs associated with the loan, in this case, a mortgage loan, such as the origination fee and discount points. The APR, therefore, almost always calculates to a higher interest rate than the nominal interest rate since fees and other costs are factored into the rate, including the interest rate. Mortgage rates are set based on a few factors, economic forces being one of them. For instance, lenders look at theprime rate—the lowest rate banks offer for loans—which typically follows trends set by the Federal Reserve’sfederal funds rate, currently set at a range of 5.25% - 5.50%. Fed Funds rates are typically stated in this type of range, which varies that rate by 0.25 percent. The 10-year Treasury bond yield can also reveal market trends. If the bond yield increases, mortgage rates tend to go up, and vice versa. The10-year Treasury yieldis usually the best standard to judge mortgage rates. That’s because many mortgages are refinanced or paid off after 10 years, even if the norm is a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan. Factors that the borrower can control are their credit score and the home equity that will be created by the down payment amount. Since a lender sets rates based on the risk they may take, borrowers who are less creditworthy or have a lower down payment amount may be quoted higher rates. In other words, the lower the risk, the lower the rate for the borrower. There are several things to keep in mind when shopping for mortgage rates to ensure you get the best deal: According to research by Freddie Mac, mortgage borrowers who shopped around for the best rate saved significant sums of money on interest and fees compared to those who did not. Specifically, those who received two quotes saved an average of $600, and those who received four or more quotes saved an average of $1,200 on the mortgage cost.Similar research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed that borrowers who shopped around saved an average of 18 basis points on their mortgage loan rate. Qualifying for better mortgage rates can help you save money, potentially tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. Here are a few ways you can ensure you find the most competitive rate possible: Amortgage applicationis made through a lender such as a bank, credit union, or mortgage company and involves providing extensive information including: The process for refinancing a mortgage is similar to getting a purchase mortgage in that it entails shopping for rates and loan terms based on your credit score and completing an application. Instead of obtaining an appraisal on the property being initially purchased a new appraisal is required on the home you are refinancing. Also, unlike a new purchase mortgage, refinancing does not require a down payment. Mortgage refinancing does involve closing costs, so it's important to project a breakeven point with these costs measured against your potential savings when rates drop enough to considerrefinancing your mortgageto determine if it makes financial sense. Below are the steps involved in refinancing a mortgage: If you're ready to pursue a mortgage, you can useour ranking of the best mortgage lendersto assess your options. A mortgage rate is the amount of interest determined by a lender to be charged on a mortgage. These rates can be fixed—meaning the rate is set based on a benchmark rate—for the duration of the borrower’s mortgage term, as in the case of a 15-year fixed rate mortgage, or variable based on the mortgage terms and current rates. The rate is one of the key factors for borrowers when seeking home financing options since it’ll affect their monthly payments and how much they’ll pay throughout the lifetime of the loan. In general, homeowners canafford a mortgagethat’s two to two-and-a-half times their annual gross income. For instance, if you earn $80,000 a year, you can afford a mortgage from $160,000 to $200,000. Keep in mind that this is a general guideline, and you need to look at additional factors when determining how much you can afford, such as your lifestyle and your attitudes and habits around personal finance. Your lender will determine what it thinks you can afford based on your income, debts, assets, and liabilities.  Using amortgage calculatorcan be helpful in this situation to help you figure out how you can comfortably afford a mortgage payment. Also known asdiscount points, this is a one-time fee, or prepaid interest borrowers purchase to lower the interest rate for their mortgage. Discount points equate to percentage points - so, one discount point costs 1% of your mortgage amount, or $1,000 for every $100,000, and will lower the rate by a quarter of a percent, or 0.25. Another option for a reduced-rate mortgage is through a2-1 buydown mortgage, which entails a low rate in the first year, a somewhat higher rate in the second year, and then the regular mortgage rate for the remaining term of the mortgage. Mortgage rates should begin to trend downward later in 2024 if the Federal Reserve lowers the Fed funds rate at any of its remaining meetings this year, as it signaled that it may do if inflation can be sustainably moderated, i.e. moving in the direction of the 2% target level. The Fed kept rates in place at its most recent meeting on June 12, however. The minimum you’ll need to put down will depend on the type of mortgage. Many lenders require a minimum of 5% to 20%, whereas others like government-backed ones require at least 3.5%. The VA loan is the exception with no down payment requirements. Generally, the higher your down payment, the lower your rate may be. Homeowners who put down at least 20% will be able to save the most. Bank of America has some of the lowest mortgage rates among big banks right now but many banks and credit unions have competitive rates in local markets around the country so borrowers should do their homework before committing to a mortgage. We rank Bank of America as the best big bank mortgage lender because they offer multiple loan options for low- and middle-income borrowers, have a massive branch network across all 50 states, and offer loans with down payments as low as 0% - 3%. When comparing rates on bank and mortgage lender websites it's important to note that many quote rates that involve the purchase of discount points. The rates that Investopedia tracks do not involve discount points. A good mortgage rate, which is usually represented as the lowest available rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage, will depend on the borrower. Lenders will advertise the lowest rate offered but yours will depend on factors like your credit history, income, other debts, and your down payment. For instance, a good mortgage rate for someone who has a low credit score tends to be higher than for someone who has a higher credit score. It’s important to understand what will affect your individual rate and work towards optimizing your finances so you can receive the most competitive rate based on your financial situation. Investopedia collects the best rates on actual closed mortgages through a third-party data provider from more than 200 companies every business day to identify the most competitive rates and terms in the nation as well as in the states in which our readers reside. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best mortgage rates since 2021. To assess mortgage rates, we first needed to create a credit profile. This profile included a credit score ranging from 700 to 760 with a property loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 80%. With this profile, we averaged the lowest rates offered by more than 200 of the nation’s top lenders. These rates represent what real consumers will see when shopping for a mortgage. The same credit profile was used for the best state rates map. We then found the lowest rate currently offered by a surveyed lender in that state. Remember that mortgage rates may change daily, and this average rate data is intended for informational purposes only. A person’s personal credit and income profile will be the deciding factors in what loan rates and terms they can get. Loan rates do not include amounts for taxes or insurance premiums, and individual lender terms will apply.

    "news_content": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Lindsay VanSomeren is a credit, credit card, and banking expert with almost a decade of experience writing for prominent personal finance sites like Forbes Advisor and Northwestern Mutual. She has a bachelor's and a master's degree in wildlife biology and conservation from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.   You can use a personal loan for almost anything, from debt consolidation to buying a boat. But not all loans and lenders are right for every use or borrower. After conducting rigorous research on 70 personal loan companies, our pick for the best overall personal loan lender isSoFidue to its low cost (with advertised rates between 8.99% and 29.49%), high customer satisfaction ratings, and an excellent benefits package.

But not all loans and lenders are right for every use or borrower. After conducting rigorous research on 70 personal loan companies, our pick for the best overall personal loan lender isSoFidue to its low cost (with advertised rates between 8.99% and 29.49%), high customer satisfaction ratings, and an excellent benefits package. Learn more about SoFi and the rest of our choices for best personal loans. While lower-rate personal loans do exist, SoFi is the most affordable lender offering a good blend of options plus some nice extras. SoFi is one of the few lenders to offer a comprehensive benefits package with all of its loans, including free financial planning from an advisor and career counseling and support. Borrowers seem to approve of this approach, rating SoFi as the fourth-best in J.D. Power’s annual survey of customer satisfaction among personal loan lenders.The biggest downside of borrowing with SoFi is that with a minimum loan amount of $5,000, borrowers looking for a smaller loan are left out.And while you can apply with a co-borrower, SoFi doesn’t offer the option to apply with a co-signer or use collateral if you’re not able to be approved otherwise. SoFi was founded in 2011 and is based in San Francisco, California. It has funded more than $73 billion in loans of various types, including student loans and personal loans. Co-borrowers are jointly responsible from the beginning to repay the loan with you.Co-signersonly repay the loan if you default, making it an easier sell to get someone on board with your loan. Zero fees charged Same-day funding available Access to SoFi membership benefits No secured loan options Can’t apply with a co-signer, but co-borrowers are accepted High minimum loan amounts As long as you’re not looking to consolidate any debt from a Discover card, a Discover personal loan is an excellent choice for debt consolidation. It offers a fast funding time with a next-business-day deposit into your bank account if everything goes smoothly, and its low rates with zero origination fees make it easier to pay back. It was ranked as the second-best personal loan option in 2024 by J.D. Power. The downside is that you can only apply as a solo applicant, although you are able to use your household income on your application, so a partner or other family member can still help you out in this area. You can’t apply with a co-signer or co-borrower or use collateral for a Discover loan, however, meaning you’ll need to qualify on your own credit merits. It’s always a good idea to pay on time to avoid damaging your credit, but in this case, it’s especially important given that Discover charges an especially high late payment fee of $39. Discover was founded in 1986 as a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company offering credit card services. It is headquartered in Riverwood, Illinois and has funded $10 billion in personal loans. No origination fee Excellent customer satisfaction ratings Can send payment to creditors directly Only accepts individual applications Can’t use collateral for a secured loan Can’t consolidate debt from a Discover credit card Upgrade accepts applicants with fair credit scores, and if you still don’t qualify or want lower rates, you can apply with three backup options: pledging a car for collateral, applying with a co-borrower, or applying with a co-signer. If you’re approved, you can receive your loan funds as soon as the next business day. You do pay a price for that convenience, however: Each personal loan comes with an origination fee ranging from 1.85% to 9.99%, an expensive fee considering many lenders don’t charge anything at all. On the other hand, Upgrade does offer rate discounts if you sign up for autopay or a debt consolidation loan, and it offers a $200 sign-up bonus if you open and use a new Upgrade checking account when you take out your loan. Upgrade is headquartered in San Francisco, California. It has provided more than $31 billion in loans and credit since 2016. Multiple discount options $200 checking account bonus offer Allows collateral, co-borrowers, and co-signers Expensive origination fee Poor customer satisfaction ratings High interest rate for some applicants For borrowers with credit scores in the \"bad\" or \"poor\" range—between 300 and 579—finding a loan is not easy. Loans those borrowers do find usually come with APRs in the high double- or triple-digits. Upstart has the lowest minimum credit score of any lender on our list; they will consider applicants who don't even have sufficient credit history to produce a score. For those who do have a score, different Upstart partners have different minimums, offering credit access to the full spectrum of credit profiles. You can borrow up to $50,000, and, if approved, your loan funds can be disbursed in as little as one day. Rates won't go higher than 35.99%. Even if you have no credit history at all, you can still be eligible for a loan if you are enrolled in or graduated from a degree program. Upstart has made available to borrowers more than $35 billion in loans of various types, including personal loans. It is headquartered in San Mateo, California and was founded in 2012. Low minimum credit score Fast funding Good loan amount flexibility High origination fee High APRs Fewer loan term options than others Pentagon Federal Credit Union—or PenFed for short—is one of the largest credit unions in the country, with nearly three million members.It’s also one of the easiest to join, with no special requirements to meet other than popping $5 into a savings account to get your membership started. You can apply for a loan without joining to see your options, but if you decide to accept PenFed’s loan offer, you’ll need to join the credit union to receive your loan funds. You’ll also need good credit in order to be approved. If you don’t have that on your own, you may be able to apply with a co-borrower or use collateral to secure your loan, although PenFed doesn’t provide any details on how this works. In addition to offering excellent rates on a wide range of loan amounts, PenFed also has a robust discount program offering savings on H&R Block tax preparation, college planning services, insurance, and more. PenFed is one of the nation’s largest credit unions. It was founded in 1935 and is headquartered in McLean, Virginia. No origination fee Excellent range of loan options Easy membership requirements Doesn’t allow co-signers, but they do allow co-borrowers Doesn't offer longer loan terms Doesn’t offer direct payment to creditors Borrowers with poor, or no, credit who cannot qualify for a personal loan from most other lenders may be able to qualify for a loan from OppLoans. Unlike most lenders, OppLoans doesn’t rely on a borrower’s credit score or credit history to make a lending decision. Borrowers also won’t pay origination fees and can access loan funds the same day. OppLoans provides a wealth of personal finance resources and tools on its website, and it has gotten strong reviews on third-party customer review sites like Trustpilot. But it’s important to note that this accessibility comes at a high cost. Interest rates on OppLoans’s loans are considerably higher than traditional personal loans—you’ll pay an APR of 160% for your loan. Additionally, repayment plans are significantly shorter, just nine to 18 months, and you can only borrow up to $4,000. OppLoans was founded in 2012 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. It has extended loans to more than a million borrowers since its founding. No minimum credit score requirement Strong customer service Same-day funding available Very high interest rates Short repayment terms Not available in all U.S. states Working with a large bank offers the added advantage of being able to walk into a branch and talk to someone about your loan. U.S. Bank is the fifth-largest bank in the country, with over 2,300 branches in about half of U.S. states.Current customers of U.S. Bank will benefit the most, with reduced credit requirements and increased maximum loan amounts. If you’re not a current customer, however, you’ll be limited to a smaller loan of $25,000 or less.U.S. Bank was ranked as the fourth-best personal loan option in 2024 by JD Power. U.S. Bank was founded in 1863 and is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. No origination fee In-branch service available Autopay discount Only available in about half of U.S. states Restrictions for non-current customers Lake Michigan Credit Union (LMCU) earns the nod for best small loan lender because it offers personal loans as small as $250—the smallest in our database with reasonable rates and terms. Many competitors have loan amounts starting between $500 and $2,000, and a few offer loans under $500, so you have some options, depending on the size of your need. LMCU also offers competitive APRs and doesn’t charge origination fees, helping to keep your borrowing costs down. Its minimum required credit score of 620 makes its loans accessible to borrowers with fair credit. Be aware that its max loan limit is low (if a larger loan is in your future), and its terms are not as flexible as other lenders we evaluated. It also doesn’t offer pre-qualification, which means you can’t see your rate and term without completing a formal application (with a slight downward nudge to your credit score). And because it’s a credit union, you’ll need to become a member before borrowing, although membership is easy to get. Today, LMCU has over $14 billion in assets, and it's the largest financial institution headquartered in West Michigan.It is the 17th largest credit union in the nation, based on asset size. Small loan amounts Low minimum credit score of 620 required No pre-qualification Membership required Navy Federal has a lot going for it. Aside from its wide range of term lengths and loan amounts to choose from, there are no origination fees and even a 0.25% rate discount on top of the already fantastic rates if you use autopay.It also received the second highest satisfaction score for personal loans in J.D. Power’s 2024 study (unofficially, as it does not meet all of J.D Power's requirements for inclusion), far surpassing any other lender. However, as the name implies, the biggest barrier for most people in accessing these loans is its military-only (or military-adjacent) membership requirement. Furthermore, assuming you’re even eligible to join, it’s a clunky process to apply if you’re not already a member. The credit union doesn’t offer a way to pre-qualify for its personal loans, meaning you’ll need to first join the credit union in order to see your options at all, even if you don’t end up selecting Navy Federal as your lender. Navy Federal Credit Union is the nation’s largest credit union. It was founded in 1933 and is headquartered in Vienna, Virginia. Same-day funding Autopay discount Second highest J.D. Power customer satisfaction ratings Doesn’t allow co-signers Not available to most civilians Doesn’t offer loan pre-qualification Patelco’s personal loan program is a bit more intricate than most lenders, but that works to your advantage. You’ll be able to choose from a broad range of loan amounts and term lengths to suit just about any need you might have. Patelco also offers two discounts. The first is a 0.10% rate reduction if you meet Commitment Household Membership by using more of the credit union’s services. The second discount is 0.50% off your interest rate for paying on time for 12 months straight. This discount is given up to three times for a total of 1.50% off your interest rate for the rest of the loan's life.It'll pay the first year of your membership requirement, unlike most credit unions. Patelco is a relatively recent addition to our list of serious competitors for the best personal loans. So it may not be surprising that there’s not many reviews out there from actual customers. In addition, its checking accounts may come with monthly fees and its savings accounts don’t always offer good rates unless you have a high balance, making this a better option for people looking more for low loan rates than for high deposit account rates. Patelco Credit Union was founded in 1936 by employees of the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph company. Its headquarters are in Dublin, California and it boasts more than $9 billion in assets. No origination fees Many discounts available Wide range of loan options Scarcity of customer reviews Uninspiring checking and savings accounts If you're looking for a lender with great customer service and competitive rates, SoFi is a good pick. It offers the best all-around blend of attractive features, like reasonable rates and quick funding. Meanwhile, Navy Federal Credit Union is our go-to recommendation for military members due to its especially customer-friendly policies and outstanding reputation. Discover, PenFed Credit Union, and Lake Michigan Credit Union round out our top picks for borrower-friendly loans. An unsecured personal loan is a general-purpose installment loan. Unlike auto loans or mortgages, apersonal loancan be used for just about anything. A personal loan is paid out in one lump sum after your application is approved, typically via a bank deposit or a check mailed to you. Once your personal loan funds are disbursed, you’ll make the same fixed monthly payment for the life of the loan, usually a few years in length. Use ourpersonal loan calculatorto zero in on a loan amount and term that fits your credit, your financial history, and your budget. You can see how long it'll take you to pay down your loan—and your loan's total cost—with different amounts, rates, and credit levels. Most personal loans are unsecured, which means they’re not backed by collateral. If you have assets such as a car or cash savings, some lenders allow you to pledge them toward asecured personal loanto get lower rates or a better chance at approval. If you default, your lender can claim ownership of your collateral to repay your debt. Personal loans may be solo, oryou can have a co-signer or a co-borroweron your loan. A co-borrower is often someone such as a spouse or partner who agrees to share responsibility with you for paying off the loan from the start. Conversely, a co-signer only agrees to repay the loan if you default, giving the lender more peace of mind—which can sway them into approving your application. You'llfind personal loansin most places where you already do your banking. Different types of lenders may offer personal loans with contrasting features or benefits.Those with excellent credit scoresmight have more opportunities. If you're in a bind, or facing an emergency expense, you may be considering apayday loan, which is like an advance on your next paycheck. These short-term loans come with high interest rates and fees, resulting in APRs of 400% and more.Because of their expense, it can be hard to break the cycle of debt, with some borrowers taking loans week after week. For these reasons, you should avoid these types of loans whenever possible. Note that some banks offer lower rates than many credit unions do, for example, and some online lenders may be pickier about your credit score than other lenders. Among the the 70 lenders we evaluated to create this list,American Express offers the lowest advertised rate, currently 6.90%. But not everyone is eligible for that rate. For one thing, American Express only lends to existing customers that it invites to apply. For another, the lowest advertised rates are only offered to borrowers with the strongest credit profiles (high credit scores, low debt-to-income ratios), and generally for loans with shorter terms. This means lenders will offer most borrowers a rate other than the lowest advertised one. And for some borrowers, that might be a rate closer to the advertisedmaximum. The average rate in the chart below isthe average rateofferedby 19 of our lender partnersto borrowers who submit applications through their systems. It includes loan offers made to people with the strongest credit profiles and to those with the weakest. The rate you might be offered may be better or worse than the average (hopefully it's better), but ultimately that will depend on the strength of your credit profile. As with any financial tool, it’s important to weigh the benefits against the drawbacks when borrowing money. Quick funding times Predictable monthly payments Cheaper than using credit cards Use for a wide range of expenses Builds credit with on-time payments Unsecured loans are more expensive than secured loans Harms credit if you miss payments or default May lose collateral if you default on secured loan Requires good to excellent credit for the best rates One of the reasons why personal loans are so popular is because they can be used for just about anything. People commonly use personal loans to pay for: Most lendersdon’tallow personal loans to be used for college tuition, business expenses, gambling, house down payments, or illegal activities. Debt consolidation is the most popular reason for getting a personal loan, according toInvestopedia's 2023 Personal Loan Borrower Survey. Home improvements and large purchases were the next two most common reasons cited for seeking a loan. Thebest debt consolidationloans are personalloans with low interest ratesand flexible repayment terms. As with any financial tool, it’s important to weigh the benefits against the drawbacks if you’re looking to borrow money. When you're shopping for a loan, here are some of the factors you should evaluate: It is important to consider all the costs potentially involved with a personal loan. Fortunately, most personal loan providers we surveyed don’t charge origination fees, which can add to the overall costs of the loan. However, it’s also important to be aware that the longer repayment terms offered by some lenders involve paying more interest over the life of the loan, despite reducing your monthly payments. - Sana Siddiqui, Investopedia Research Analyst Personal loans are usually easy to qualify for, but getting a loan with bad credit can be hard. Each lender has specific requirements you’ll need to meet, but in general, your chances of qualifying with any given lender increase if you havegood to excellent credit, a consistently high income, and low existing debt payments. A healthy debt-to-income ratio will improve your approval odds and help you get a better rate. It may also be easier to qualify for smaller loan amounts with shorter term lengths. Before you apply for a personal loan, take a hard look at your finances. Most lenders allow you toapply for a personal loanonline, although you may be able to apply in person or over the phone, especially if you're dealing with a bank or credit union. Personal loans are not your only option if you need a flexible way to borrow money. Depending on your circumstances, here are a few other good options to consider: U.S. Bank offers the best personal loans amongbig banks, according to our research. It features affordable rates with no origination fees and is available to roughly half of U.S. states. If you’re willing to work with an online lender, SoFi is our best all-around choice, featuring similar rates to U.S. Bank but offering an additional benefits package with free access to financial advisors and career counseling, among other benefits. If you don’t have good credit or a high income on your own, it may beeasier to get approvedif you have a creditworthy co-signer or co-borrower. Some lenders also allow you to use collateral to better qualify for a loan or receive lower rates. Finally, a personal loan from an institution you already have a relationship with, like a bank or credit union you have a checking or savings account with, may provide a more streamlined approval process. The average personal loan borrower had a credit score of 685 during the final quarter of 2022.This can vary quite a bit, though; some lenders, such as Upstart, have no minimum credit score requirement. Others, require a credit score over 700. Banks and credit unions tend to have highercredit score requirements, while fintech lenders generally accept lower credit scores. Some lenders, such as SoFi, offer personal loans up to $100,000.However, that doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily qualify for that much. Each lender assesses your financial situation—including your monthly income and debt payments—when deciding themaximum loan amountyou can borrow after you submit a loan application. A personal loan from a bank or other lender is not considered income by the IRS, andis not taxable. However, if you were run into financial trouble and worked out an agreement with your lender to forgive the loan, the amount forgiven would be considered income, and would be taxable.In some cases the lender might send you a form (1099-C, Cancellation of Debt), which will note the amount you must report on your tax return.Regardless if your lender sends you the form, you must report the forgiven debt as income on your return. The monthly cost of a personal loan, of whatever amount, will depend on the loan amount, the loan term (or the number of monthly payments), and the interest rate. The easiest way to calculate a monthly payment is to use apersonal loan calculator. A $5,000 loan, paid over 24 months (or two years), with an interest rate of 12.33% (the current average rate charged on two-year personal loans, according to the Federal Reserve) would result in a monthly payment of $236.14. According to Investopedia's research,SoFi offers the best personal loanswhen you consider rates, fees, amounts and term, and additional factors like customer experience. Some lenders offer loans for lower interest rates or accept borrowers with weaker credit profiles or offer longer terms. But overall, we rate SoFi the highest. According to our research,SoFi is the best overall personal loan lenderbased on it's combination of competitive rates, large loan amounts, and wide range of repayment terms. Where it really shines is with customer service and experience, offering a bevy helpful services to its customers, from a well-regarded mobile app to financial hardship assistance.

    "news_content": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Lindsay VanSomeren is a credit, credit card, and banking expert with almost a decade of experience writing for prominent personal finance sites like Forbes Advisor and Northwestern Mutual. She has a bachelor's and a master's degree in wildlife biology and conservation from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. PenFed Credit Union is the best overall auto loan lender thanks to its wide selection of loan types and competitive rates, according to our research. It offers rates for used car loans as low as 6.49%, and another one of our picks, OpenRoad Lending, offers refinance rates as low as 1.99%. We reviewed 21 auto loan lenders and collected the best new, used, and refinance auto loan rates, evaluating APRs, loan types, loan terms, vehicle and borrower requirements, and other factors. We also surveyed 1,016 auto loan borrowers, asking how they felt about specific lenders and the loan process. Full suite of auto loan types available Allows private-party vehicle purchases Promotional offers if you use car-buying service Must join credit union Doesn’t allow co-signers No rate discounts available PenFed is our top pick overall for auto financing because it offers all of the loan types you’d ever hope to use, and offers competitive rates: loans for new or used cars, refinances, cash-out refinances, and even lease buyout loans. You can even get a used car loan to buy a car from a private seller. PenFed will mail you a check if you’re approved for any of its loans. That can take a few days, but if you’re OK with using the TrueCar car-buying service, PenFed offers a pretty good relationship discount. Your loan could be funded the same day you’re approved, if you use this service. PenFed's customer service is available by phone or secure online message. PenFed has been in business since 1935, and has headquarters in McLean, Virginia. Read our fullPenFed Auto Loans Reviewfor more information. AutoPay Relatively low rates No payments for 45 days Low minimum credit score requirement Very sparse on loan details Doesn’t disclose partner lenders Can’t apply with a co-signer, only a co-borrower AUTOPAY is a loan aggregator and it's a bit light on the details; maybe intentional in order to get you to bite. If you have excellent borrower qualifications, AUTOPAY certainly has the potential to be one of your cheapest financing options, advertising some of the best car loan rates today compared to other lenders and aggregators. It's our top pick for bad credit because it works with borrowers with credit scores as low as 500; but it doesn’t specify thetopend of the rate range you’d be likely to pay if you have poor credit, so you’ll need to be careful—especially since you can’tapply with a co-signer(only a co-borrower). But, if you do have good credit, you may enjoy some very good interest rates. AUTOPAY does offer a full suite of auto loan types: used cars, new cars, refinances, cash-out refinances, and even lease buyout loans. It works with a network of partner lenders rather than offering the loans itself, and that’s how it can offer so much flexibility. For that reason, it’s a good choice to add to your shopping list, although we would prefer if it offered more concrete details. AUTOPAY was founded in 2007, and is based in Denver, Colorado. You can get in touch with the company by phone or online message. Read more in our fullAUTOPAY auto loans review. The best auto loan rates are often advertised through third-party companies that network with partner lenders, like AUTOPAY. Most of those networks don’t disclose their partners, however, so you can’t always see all of the companies you’re actually checking your rates with. You may need to sign up for automatic payments to get the best rates, as well. Consumers Credit Union Allows co-signers No age or mileage restrictions Offers a full suite of car loan options Can only be used at a dealership Must join credit union to receive loan Lack of transparency about loan requirements As our highest-rated credit union, Consumers Credit Union is a good choice for people who prefer to bank with these financial institutions. It’s also a good choice if you’re trying to buy an older car from a dealership because it’s one of the few lenders that doesn’t put any limits on your vehicle’s model year or mileage. Consumers CU also offers an optional mechanical repair insurance plan through ForeverCar, which might be especially important if youaredriving an older car. It also has a relatively low minimum loan amount. Consumers CU doesn’t specify what sort of credit history you need to qualify for a loan (or any other qualifications, really), but it might be good to add this one to your shopping list if you have bad credit. The maximum rate you’ll pay for a refinance loan, for example, is about half of what some other lenders may charge. Customer support is available by phone, email, or live online chat. Consumers Credit Union was chartered in 1930, and has corporate headquarters in Round Lake Beach, Illinois. Learn more in our fullConsumer Credit Union Auto Loans Review. LendingTree Potential for very low rates Compare many refinance loan offers at once No limits on age or mileage of vehicle Can generate a lot of spam Very low loan-to-value ratios Doesn’t offer many details about its loans LendingTree is another company that can help you quickly identify the best financing rates from among its network of lenders. It suffers from the same problems as other lender networks, however—namely, that it doesn’t tell you which lenders it’s checking your rates with, nor what the types of loans you might qualify for look like. You can also expect a lot of companies reaching out to you with spam, too. Still, it’s a great option if you’re looking for a car loan refinance, advertising competitively low rates. You’ll just need to make sure you have plenty of equity in your vehicle since LendingTree lenders don’t offer loans with a loan-to-value ratio above 80%. That means underwater loans aren’t eligible for refinancing. You can contact LendingTree by phone, but if you used LendingTree to get a loan with a partner lender you'll likely need to contact that lender instead. LendingTree was founded in 1996, and now has headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Read more in our fullLendingTree Auto Loans Review. LendingClub Minimum recommended credit score of 600 No loan fees Can refinance with the same lender Low rates for well-qualified borrowers Doesn’t allow co-signers Many residency and car restrictions Doesn’t offer new or used auto loans LendingClub, the former peer-to-peer lender, is now in the auto refinance business where it offers very good rates to borrowers with good credit. Borrowers with fair credit can be approved too—making it our top pick for this category, along with its high overall score as well—but if your credit is quite bad LendingTree may charge you a higher rate than most other lenders. On the bright side, LendingClub doesn’t charge any fees—origination fees, late fees, prepayment penalties, nothing. LendingClub is one of a handful of lenders that allow you to refinance your current LendingClub loan with another LendingClub loan, if you happen to qualify. However, be aware that there are many loan limitations with this lender. It’s not available in many sparsely populated states, for example, and there are many makes and models of popular cars LendingClub won’t finance. LendingClub was incorporated in 2007, and it's headquartered in San Francisco, California. If you're dealing with less-than-perfect credit, see our picks for thebest auto loans for fair creditto explore further options. In addition: Carvana Neat, techy way to buy a car Offers seven-day return policy Long 45-day pre-approval window Not available outside of contiguous U.S. Doesn’t allow co-borrowers, only co-signers Delivery charges not refundable if you return car Carvana is a used car dealership that offers a completely online car-buying experience, similar to TrueCar; it's our highest-rated company that offers this service. You canapply for an auto loanonline, find a car, and then pick it up or even have it delivered to you. One of Carvana’s claims to fame, however, is its car vending machines. If you’re pre-approved for a loan you can schedule an appointment to take a car for a test drive from one of its giant vending machines. The company will even provide you with a token to use. If you like the car, you can keep it. If not, you’ll have seven days to return it. It’s a futuristic way to buy a car that many people like; however, there can be problems with the setup. If you have a car delivered and you don’t like it, for example, you can return it, but the shipping charge is nonrefundable. That makes it costly and impractical to test drive different models like you would at a dealership. Carvana's customer support team is available by text or by live chat on the website, and there's a mobile app you can download for iPhone and Android. The company was founded in 2012, and is based in Tempe, Arizona. Learn more in our fullCarvana Auto Loans Review. OpenRoad Lending Maximum accepted mileage of 160,000, according to customer service Offers lease buyout loans Refinancing available if you’re underwater on loan Can re-refinance your loan through OpenRoad again Potentially high rates and fees Doesn’t allow co-signers Many vehicle restrictions OpenRoad Lending’s website looks like it was designed in the previous decade. But it can be helpful if you’re struggling to make your auto loan payments and you’re not able to qualify for a better loan with another lender—especially if you need to refinance a loan for a high-mileage car, because OpenRoad Lending's 160,000 mile-limit is the highest disclosed limit among lenders we reviewed. It comes with very high origination fees ranging from $249 to $449, a 5% late payment fee, and interest rates that zoom into credit-card-debt territory for less-qualified borrowers. However, OpenRoad Lending is still better than many other types of alternative auto loans, such as those frombuy-here-pay-here lenders. You can still qualify if you have a poor credit score, even if you’re underwater on your current loan—a common problem for people with bad car loans. OpenRoad Lending has a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 180%, meaning you may be able to borrow nearly twice your car’s actual value in order to pay off your existing loan—far more than most other lenders. OpenRoad Lending was founded in 2009, and is based in Fort Worth, Texas. If you need help, you can get in touch with OpenRoad by phone or email. Read more in our fullOpenRoad Lending Auto Loans Review. If you’re looking for the best overallauto loans, try starting with PenFed; it's a credit union, but anyone can join for just $5 when approved for a loan. AUTOPAY is worth checking as well, especially if you'd like to browse a variety of lenders. LendingTree is also a top choice for a rate-comparison website, while LendingClub can help people with fair credit get financing. If you prefer sticking with credit unions, Consumers Credit Union is yet another good option that allows anyone to apply. Or, if you’re not too picky about your car and prefer a more streamlined experience, Carvana offers some unique and affordable financing options. And finally, while expensive, OpenRoad Lending offers a lot of potential if you’re looking to get out of a car loan with a high rate. Investopedia collected 1,176 key data points from 21 companies across three months to identify the most important factors for readers choosing an auto loan. We used this data to review each company for interest rates, loan requirements, and other features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best auto loans since 2020. Looking for a specific type of loan? See our top picks for auto loans in a variety of categories: An auto loan is an installment loan used to buy a new or used car, or torefinance an existing auto loan. Auto loans are usuallysecured, which means the vehicle serves as collateral for the loan. If you fail to make monthly car payments as agreed, the lender can seize the vehicle. You can use apersonal loanto make a car purchase, but secured auto loans typically have lower rates because lenders have more security if you don't pay as agreed. Auto loan lenders may allow you to borrow more than the purchase price of the car, to account for taxes, fees, dealer upgrades, and other add-ons. Like other installment loans, when you borrow money with an auto loan the funds are provided in a lump sum. The borrower makes equal monthly installment payments until the term loan is paid off. The money is lent at interest, so the borrower ends up paying back more than they originally borrow. For many people, getting an auto loan is a crucial step in the car buying process: Over 80% of new cars and over 37% of used cars were financed in Q1 of 2024. No matter the price of the car, the interest rate of your loan plays a major part in the overall cost you pay. Dealerships will often try to sell you on a loan through their partners, and you may find a good deal this way. But you might save thousands over the course of the loan if you can find a better rate yourself through an independent lender, so it's worth shopping around. Longer loan terms may come with a lower monthly payment and lowerannual percentage rates (APRs), but don't be fooled. In general, it's best to choose the shortest term and the highest monthly payments you can afford. Although long-term loans may come with lower monthly payments, making them more affordable on a month-by-month basis, shorter-term loans will make the overall cost less expensive because you accrue less interest. When the loan is fully paid off, the vehicle belongs to the borrower (instead of the lender). Auto loans are available from traditional banks, online banks, credit unions, and lending marketplaces (which partner with banks and credit unions). You'll find new, used, and refinance auto loans from all of those sources, although some lenders only offer certain loan types; some lenders offer special deals forfirst-time car buyers, as well. Auto loans are also available through dealerships that partner with banks; in some cases you may find lower rates through a dealership, but it's worth getting pre-approved with lenders on your own to see what kind of rates you can get. Then, you can go to the dealership with some bargaining power—see if the dealer will beat the best rate you found on your own. Learn more in ourexpert explanation of how auto loans work. Some people choose the type of car they get based on the type of loan they'd like. For example, new cars are more expensive, but the loans are often much cheaper than for used cars—and that’s one reason many people prefernew cars over used cars. Auto loans can either besecured or unsecured. Most auto loans are secured by the very car you’re buying and offer lower rates because of that. Your car serves as collateral for the loan and if you don’t repay it, the lender will repossess your car. Unsecuredcar loans aren’t as common, but some lenders (likeLightStream) do offer them. They’re often faster to get but they charge much higher rates because the lender doesn’t have an easy way to get their money back if you default. Auto loan rates depend in part on the federal prime rate, but the borrower's qualifications play a large role as well. When it comes to auto loans,pre-qualification and pre-approvalusually mean different things. But it's important to realize that some lenders and advice columns may use the terms interchangeably. Pre-qualification generally involves a lighter, less extensive check than pre-approval. Pre-qualification may only require some basic personal information, and the lender may perform asoft credit check, which has no effect on your credit score. Information provided for a pre-qualification won't be verified by the lender—it's just meant to give you an idea of the rate you may qualify for. Pre-approval involves a more in-depth check of your credit and finances. It typically requires a hard credit check, which can slightly affect your credit, and the lender may ask for more information and documentation. The lender may attempt to verify the information, as well. Neither pre-qualification nor pre-approval means that you'reguaranteedto be approved. In general,predatory lendingrefers to loans with unfair, deceptive, or abusive terms. These loans may offer borrowers worse terms than they deserve, based on their credit rating, or they may have exorbitantly high fees and/or high interest rates. Predatory lenders may exploit borrowers with aggressive tactics, or they may be outright deceptive. Borrowers who lack sufficient understanding are encouraged to take out loans that they likely can't pay back. Lenders might charge high upfront fees so they can make money before the loan defaults. Beware of subprime auto loans,car title loans,buy-here-pay-here loans, andpayday loans. These may come with very high costs that are above typical market rates. If you’re not able to qualify on your own and you have someone who’s willing to help, applying with a co-signer can improve your odds of qualifying for a loan. “When my wife and I were shopping for a car last year, we prepared by getting a pre-qualification from our bank—Bank of America. We did it online, through our account portal. It was really easy, and because we have several accounts with BofA, we qualified for a rate discount. We planned on using the pre-approval as a negotiating tool, and figured the dealer would offer a better rate. To our surprise, the dealer couldn’t beat it. So now we have yet another account with BofA.” — Lars Peterson (Investopedia Senior Editor, Financial Products and Services). Once you find the car you want, you can provide the details to your chosen lender and submit a full loan application. The lender will usually disburse the loan funds directly to you, either by check or bank deposit. In some cases lenders may send the money directly to dealerships; for refinance loans, lenders may send the money directly to the current holder of your loan. Your new lender will provide you with details on how to set up an account, manage your loan, and make payments. See how much car you can afford with ourauto loan calculator; plug in your details, and you can see how big your monthly payments will be at different terms and interest rates. Say you take out a loan for a new 2024 Ford F-150 Platinum with the following details, for example: With those terms, you'd have a monthly loan payment of$1,025.52. If you were to make a larger down payment, such as $8,000, you could take out a smaller loan ($56,915), and your monthly payment would be$974.17. You'd pay less overall:$70,140.59over the life of the loan. In the News:Auto loan rates are related to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate—if the Fed rate goes up, average auto loan rates usually will, as well. The Fedcut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%–5.00% at its Sept. 18, 2024, meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means interest rates (including auto loan rates) will decline. We included big banks like Chase,Capital One, Bank of America, and U.S. Bank in our review of the auto loan industry, but these financial institutions don't always make our \"Best\" lists. Why? Although these banks are reliable and used by millions of people, they usually don't offer the very best rates and terms. Online banks and lender marketplaces tend to have lower operating costs, and can pass those savings on to borrowers. Big banks tend to score well in our rankings, but they don't usually come out on top when it comes to auto loan interest rates, flexibility in terms, and accessibility. Our top-rated lenders offer the lowest rates on new and used car loans in the auto financing industry—if you've got good credit and you want the best rates, take a look atPenFed,AUTOPAY,Consumers Credit Union,LendingTree,LendingClub, andOpenRoad Lending. You'll also find several good options for refinancing, as well. Not everyone qualifies for the best auto loan rates. Here aresome things you can dobefore and during the application process to tip the odds in your favor: There is no overall minimum credit score you’ll need toqualify for an auto loan.It depends on the company, because lender requirements vary. In general, if you have good or excellent credit (670 or higher), you’ll qualify for the best auto loan rates.Lenders typically use an auto-loan specific credit scoring model (like a FICO score or VantageScore). See thebest car loans for bad creditif you’re dealing with a lower score. Auto loan interest is not usuallytax-deductible, but there is a situation where it may be. If you use a car for business purposes, you may be able to deduct interest that accrues on your auto loan as a business expense (commuting to your job won't typically count). If you use the car for both personal and business purposes, you may be able to claim deductions for business-related expenses (including interest along with other expenses like vehicle maintenance, gas, and insurance). We recommend speaking with a tax attorney to learn about deductions for your specific situation. Ultimately, thebest time to buy a caris when you need one. But if you have some flexibility, experts recommend the following times: According to a report by Experian in Nov. 2023, average rates for 2023 were 7.03% for new cars and 11.35% for used cars, although rates will have changed somewhat since then. If you get a rate lower than the average, you can generally feel like you're getting a good deal. Your rate will vary depending on your credit score, income, and other factors. By Nov. 2023, the average interest rate for used cars in 2023 was 11.35%, according to Experian. Here's the average used car loan interest rate for each credit score range: We researched and reviewed 21 companies to find the best seven lenders you see on the list above.

    "news_content": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. How to choose the right credit card Katrina Ávila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications. Credit cards can play an important role in how you make purchases and manage your finances. They can be used for everyday purchases like groceries or gas, as well as big-ticket items like vacations. And many credit cards offer you extra benefits so you can earn and save more, and lead your desired lifestyle. The best credit cards offer cash back, miles, or points; offer protection on purchases; and provide interest-free financing opportunities and other valuable benefits. When used responsibly, credit cards can also help you build credit. However, with so many credit cards to choose from, it can be challenging to find the right card for your situation. That's why Investopedia's list of best credit cards can help guide the way. To find the best credit cards for our list, we evaluated each card based on its fees, rewards, welcome bonuses, introductory offers, features, and benefits. The Capital One® Quicksilver Cash Rewards card is our best overall credit card and best for cash back because of its combination of low fees, low interest, and high rewards earning rate. With no annual fee, you don't need to worry about making sure you're extracting maximum value from the card every year to make it worth it. The absence of a foreign transaction fee makes this a rare cash back credit card that’s worth bringing on a trip abroad and helps make a compelling case that if you're only going to carry one card, this should be it. Simple rewards program with a solid return Decent introductory offers on purchases No annual or foreign transaction fees No bonus rewards rates One-time bonus is relatively modest The Chase Sapphire Reserve® is our best credit card for travel and best for rewards because of its competitive one-time point bonus, high rewards earning rate, and its suitcase-full of travel perks and benefits. Points are worth 50% more if you redeem them for travel through the Chase Travel℠ portal, and you can transfer points on a 1:1 basis to a long list of eligible hotel and airline partners. While the annual fee is high, if you're an avid traveler, the $300 annual travel credit can help justify the expense. Chase Sapphire Reserve also offers numerous other premium travel-related benefits and flexible redemption options through Chase's Travel℠ program. Excellent points rewards rate for travel and dining Complimentary Airport Lounge Access plus Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fee credit Points are worth 50% more for travel bought through Chase Travel℠ Annual travel credit $550 annual fee Limited high-rewards categories Strong credit is recommended Based on our analysis, the United Explorer Card offers the one of the highest value per mile earned of any airline credit card, and miles can be redeemed in multiple ways, including for flights on member participating airlines in its Star Alliance, one of the largest global airline partnerships. You'll need to be committed to United as your primary airline in order to maximize the benefit from the card. The card's compelling introductory bonus really adds to the card's value because of the high value placed on redeeming those miles with United. The $95 annual fee is in line with its competitors and is waived the first year. The card does not charge foreign transaction fees, which helps make it an excellent choice for international travel. United has announced that it has permanently eliminated reservation change fees, which should greatly reduce any traveler anxiety around booking future award travel with earned miles and make the introductory bonus on this card that much more appealing. Annual fee is waived the first year Earn two miles per $1 on United, dining, and hotels Exclusive perks with United, like early boarding and free checked bags Fewer free checked bags than some competing airline cards Balance transfer fee of 5% (min $5) Our choice for the best overall credit card for hotels is the World of Hyatt Credit Card because it offers an attractive introductory one-time bonus of 30,000 points after spending $3,000 in the first three months of account opening. World of Hyatt cardmembers also earn an automatic award night at a category 1-4 Hyatt property upon each anniversary, which alone can justify the card's modest annual fee of $95. As for the World of Hyatt Credit Card's rewards earning rate, cardmembers can enjoy 4 Bonus points per $1 spent on purchases at all Hyatt hotels. Plus, 5 Base points for Hyatt per eligible $1 spent for being a World of Hyatt member. Earn 2 Bonus Points per $1 spent at restaurants, on airline tickets purchased directly from the airline, local transit, and commuting as well as fitness club and gym memberships. Plus, earn 1 Bonus Point per $1 spent on all other purchases. Investopedia values World of Hyatt points higher than any other hotel brand. Outstanding introductory rewards bonus Superior points value among hotel reward cards Anniversary award night good for a stay at category 1-4 Hyatt properties Annual fee isn't waived first year Hyatt hotels are not as widespread as other hotel chains Rewards earning structure can be confusing The Citi® Diamond Preferred® Credit Card is an excellent choice for transferring a balance. It offers a 0% introductory rate on purchases for 12 months and 0% on balance transfers for 21 months. Balance transfers must be completed within four months of account opening and incur a 5% fee (min $5) of the amount transferred. After the promotion expires, the interest rate reverts to a variable APR ranging from 17.74% to 28.49%, depending on your creditworthiness. The card does not charge an annual fee. Balance transfers have 21 months of no interest Purchases during the first 12 months are not charged interest No annual fee Penalty APR of up to 29.99% with a late or returned payment Does not offer a welcome bonus or earn rewards 3% foreign transaction fee The Bank of America Travel Rewards for Students is our pick for the best student credit card because of the high earning rate on its rewards program that you can then redeem for all sorts of travel expenses. It also has a long introductory APR on purchases and no annual fee, which add to the card's strong rating. Plus, the lack of foreign transaction fees makes this an ideal card for student travel outside the U.S. The Bank of America Travel Rewards for Students card also offers excellent credit education and monitoring services. Unlimited 1.5x rewards on all purchases Pay off purchases for 15 billing cycles with no interest Friendly to foreign travel Rewards aren't transferable Relatively high spending required ($1,000 in the first 90 days of account opening) for 25,000-point introductory one-time bonus The Ink Business Preferred Credit Card is the best card for business owners because of its earning power. You'll earn 3 points per dollar on the first $150,000 you spend each year in combined purchases of travel, shipping, online advertising, and internet, cable, and phone services. New cardholders can earn 900,000 bonus points after spending $8,000 within three months. That's worth $900 in cash back through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. Points earned with this card can be transferred to airline and hotel partners, redeemed for cash and gift cards, or used to book travel with a 25% bonus through the Chase travel portal. Employee cards are available at no extra cost, and complimentary tools allow you to stay on top of your business. These tools include fraud protection, purchase protection, personalized account alerts, and more. Potentially huge bonus Flexible rewards program High rewards on select business expenses Low base rewards rate Not a lot of business-related benefits Grocery shopping is more rewarding with the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express. You can earn a full 6% back at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $6,000 per year in purchases), 6% back on select U.S. streaming subscriptions, 3% back on eligible transit and U.S. gas stations, and 1% back on all other purchases. Plus, you'll earn a $250 statement credit after spending $3,000 within six months. New cardholders can also use the 0% APR introductory offer on purchases for 12 months. There is a $95 annual fee, but it is waived the first year. So, you can enjoy the cash back features of this card during that period to experience its benefits before paying an annual fee in year two. Ability to earn 6% cash back on groceries, streaming services and gas station purchases Annual fee is waived the first year 0% APR promotion on purchases for 12 months 6% grocery cash back is limited to $6,000 in purchases per year High penalty APR for late and returned payments Foreign transaction fee of 2.7% The Capital One® SavorOne® Cash Rewards credit card is an excellent choice for shopping online, including groceries (excluding superstores like Walmart® and Target®) and take out food as well as for charging online entertainment streaming services like Netflix, HBO, Disney+, and Hulu. Specifically, it earns a full 3% cash back on dining, entertainment, popular streaming services, and on grocery store purchases, plus 1% on all other spending. So, you can earn extra cash back rewards whether you're shopping online, out with friends, or enjoying a quiet night at home. New cardmembers receive a $200 cash bonus after spending $500 within three months. Plus, there is no annual fee, so all of the cash back that you earn is yours to keep. Travelers will love that there are no foreign transaction fees, so there are no surprises when making international purchases. Ability to earn 3% cash back for dining, entertainment, and streaming service purchases 0% APR purchase promo for 15 months No foreign transaction fees Welcome bonus is on the smaller side Bonus cash back excludes Walmart and Target The Capital One Platinum Secured Card is Investopedia's choice for best secured card due to its lack of an annual fee and its security deposit flexibility, allowing customers to make installment deposits over time rather than all upfront. Capital One also provides automatic credit line increases over time with responsible card use and offers an array of non-secured card options that customers can consider once they have built up their credit scores. No annual fee makes the Capital One Platinum Secured Card an affordable on-ramp to establishing a positive credit history. Credit limits can be larger than the required security deposit Security deposit can be paid in installments No annual or foreign transaction fees Requires a bank account Relatively low initial credit limits No bonus offers or rewards program Credit cards have a wide range of fees, interest rates, benefits, promotions, welcome offers, and more. Because each credit card is different, finding the right one depends on your budget, how much you spend and where, and what benefits are important to you. While some people avoid paying annual fees, many are willing to do so if the benefits far exceed what they pay each year. The Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards is our top choice for the best credit card because it offers an unlimited 1.5% cash back on every purchase. It has no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees, and a $200 welcome bonus that is earned after spending just $500 within three months. The best credit card for you depends on your goals, budget, and spending habits. As your financial picture evolves, the best credit card for you may also change. While credit card rewards can be valuable, if you’re focused on paying off debt, they may not be the best choice for you at this time. A card that offers a 0% APR promotion forbalance transfersmay be the better option until you can pay off your debt. However, the most appealing credit card may not be the best one you can actually get right now. People with low credit scores may be able to qualify only for cards that carry higher interest rates and fewer rewards. Those consumers should focus on building their credit until they are eligible for the credit card they desire. People with excellent credit generally have their choice of travel and other rewards credit cards. Credit cards aimed at those with the best credit scores typically provide the most attractive benefits. These can include lucrative one-time bonuses, significant ongoing rewards on your spending, and additional benefits like elite status, free checked bags, yearly free hotel nights, and airport lounge access. Finding the best credit card entails both self-assessment and research. You must document your creditworthiness and spending habits and reflect on how you may use the card, whether that's to build credit, temporarily borrow, or simply employ it as a purchasing convenience and a way to earn rewards. New to Credit:If you are new to credit or have impaired credit, asecured credit cardcan be a great option. This type of card requires a security deposit but has the advantage that activity with the card is reported to all three credit bureaus, which helps the cardholder build credit over time. Many secured cards offer an option to graduate to a non-secured card after a period of on-time payments. Carrying a Balance:Those who are carrying a card balance should consider shifting the debt to a balance transfer card with much lower interest, or even no interest rate at all for a period. These cards provide relief in the form of an extended period of a 0% APR on the transfer, which allows you to pay down the balance more easily. While some balance transfer cards offer rewards as well, it’s best not to add to your balance on the card (or, preferably, any other card) until you have paid off the amount you’ve transferred. If you frequently carry a credit card balance, avoid cards with high fees and interest regardless of attractive rewards and one-time bonuses. Your priority should be paying down your debt and avoiding accumulating more, not trying to earn rewards. No Balance:People whotend to pay off their card balance each month should consider getting a rewards card that offers cash back or points rewards. These cards allow you to leverage your everyday spending to earn hundreds of dollars worth of rewards, usually with no annual fee. Frequent Travelers:For those who travel, a general travel card or one issued in partnership with airlines or hotels can make the most sense. These allow you to leverage spending on travel and in other categories to earn rewards that can be used to obtain further travel. Entrepreneurs and Small-business Owners:These users can choose among a host of business credit cards designed for their needs. These cards may reward business spending in certain categories, like shipping, or with specific business-related merchants, such as office supply stores. College Students:People in schoolgenerally don’t have a credit history, but they do represent a good long-term customer for card issuers. Cards designed for students can provide online resources to instruct new cardmembers on the responsible use of credit and other tips to guide personal finances. The higher your credit score, the more credit cards you potentially have available to you, and the better those cards will tend to be in terms of interest rates, credit lines, and rewards programs. To understand your card choices, it’s important to know the broad range into which your credit score fits. Card issuers classify scores as “Excellent/Exceptional” (800+), “Very Good” (740-799), “Good” (670-739), “Fair” (580-669), or “Poor” (below 580). It’s best to only apply for cards that best match the credit recommended by the issuer to reduce the chances of being declined. If you don’t know your current credit score, it’s available in anumber of ways, and at no cost. There are two main credit score types, FICO and VantageScore, both of which have their own distinct scoring algorithms and score ranges that are used by various lenders. Credit card issuers also assess other factors beyond credit score in evaluating creditworthiness, including employment status, income, and other credit and deposit accounts you own. There are credit cards designed for those whose credit is fair, poor, and even very poor or bad. In particular, asecured credit cardallows those with bad credit or no credit history to build or rebuild their score. Until they’ve completed that process, they must retain the use of the card through a security deposit that usually serves as the maximum credit line for the account. Credit card rewards come in a variety of forms, allowing cardholders to earn cash back, points, or miles for each dollar of spending. The earnings rates for rewards often vary by purchase type, with higher rewards available for certain categories of purchases. Cash back rewards are the most straightforward type and usually rebate a percentage of spending in the form of a check or statement credit. Rewards based on points or miles offer greater flexibility in how they are redeemed, whether as travel, gift cards, merchandise, or more. Some travel credit cards offer rewards for travel in general, which can be redeemed for purchases with any airline of hotel; other travel cards are co-branded with specific airlines or hotels, in which case they offer partner-specific points or miles. Co-branded cards provide less flexibility in redeeming rewards but potentially more value, provided you’re comfortable favoring a particular brand of airline or hotel chain. While issuers may prominently tout certain features of their cards, other benefits tend to be buried in cards’ fine print—including some you might not realize the card even offers. Here’s a quick list of benefits that are commonly offered with a range of card types: Common Rewards Card Benefits  Common Travel Rewards Card Benefits  Premium Card Benefits We constantly monitor credit card offers from card-issuer websites and publicly available sources to find the best credit cards for our readers. Each credit card is evaluated based on its fees, rewards, welcome bonuses, introductory offers, features, and benefits so that we can determine a winner for each category.

    "news_title": "Best Credit Repair Companies for November 2024",
    "news_content": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Credit repair companies work on your behalf with creditors and the three major credit bureaus to help remove questionable items from your credit reports and improve your credit score. You can always try to repair your credit yourself; however, depending on your financial situation, working with a reputable credit repair service may save you time and provide a better outcome in the long run. In addition to disputing errors on your credit report, a good credit repair company will also offer services like credit score tracking and identity theft insurance as an added bonus, all at an affordable price. Ideally, you'll also want to work with a credit repair company that has a reasonable cancellation policy and provides a money-back guarantee. According to our research, Credit Pros is the best overall credit repair company due to its credit builder loan and line of credit offerings, money-back guarantee, and mobile app. To choose the best credit repair companies, we evaluated 17 credit repair services on 39 factors, including Costs and Fees (40.5%), Services Offered (34%), Customer Experiences (22.5%), and Stability (3%). Some credit repair companies only work with one or two of the major credit bureaus, but each company on our list works with all three—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. The Credit Pros is our choice for Best Overall thanks to itscredit builder loanandline of credit, along with being top-notch for most of the other criteria we reviewed. Prospective clients get a free credit repair consultation to help them decide which of the company's three packages is best for them. While Credit Pros doesn’t clearly outline the types of letters it will send to thecredit bureausor creditors on your behalf, it does get to work quickly. New customers can expect this company to start working on their credit just three to five business days after signing up, and you can track progress through the Credit Pros mobile app or online portal. Credit builder loan available Mobile app available Offers money-back guarantee $5,000.00 line of credit with National Credit Direct available No debt management program available Higher cost than some competitors The Money Management plan offered by Credit Pros (which doesn't actually include any credit repair services) costs $69.00 per month. The next level, Prosperity, costs $129.00 per month and does include credit repair. Customers who need significant assistance can also opt for its Success Plus plan for $149.00 per month. To be eligible for a credit builder loan you'll need to sign up for the Success Plus plan, and then apply. Credit builder loans are a bit like reverse loans—you make the payments first, and then you get the money. Make all your payments on time, and you'll wind up with a loan account on your credit reports in good standing, which can help improve your credit. Credit Pros' credit builder loan reports to all three major credit bureaus. According to customer support, the $5,000.00 line of credit is available with the Money Management plan; this is less useful than the credit builder loan because it only reports to Experian. That means it won't show up on your TransUnion and Equifax credit reports. This line of credit is quite limited, as it can only be used for purchases with the National Credit Direct store. As a Credit Pros customer, you’ll get access to TransUnion credit monitoring, so if there are changes to your report you’ll be alerted quickly. All packages also come with budgeting and bill payment tools, in addition to identity theft protection. With its Success Plus plan, you’ll get unlimited credit bureau disputes, creditor interventions, access to your credit reports and scores with all three bureaus, as well as a credit builder loan. Originally founded in 2009, Credit Pros is headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida.For more information, see the fullCredit Pros Credit Repair review.

Money-back guarantee Competitive pricing Offers free credit consultation No mobile app Doesn’t offer a debt management program No identity theft insurance The Credit People offers a free credit repair consultation and one service package with three payment options. Customers can choose to pay $99.00 per month, $119.00 per month, or $599.00 per year.

While Sky Blue offers a generous array of features and services, it provides fewer customer service options than some competitors. Clients can connect with customer service over the phone, via email, and by getting a support ticket. But it doesn’t offer live chat or a mobile app, which is surprising given that the company has been in business so long.

Credit Assistance Network The Credit Assistance Network has been helping its customers repair their credit since 2004.While it offers many of the services you’d expect from a credit repair company, including dispute, debt validation, and goodwill letters, customers also get credit monitoring and alerts, identity theft protection, and access to personal finance tools.

The Money Management plan comes with all of the services we discussed above, while the higher-tier plans come with added features like medication discounts and guaranteed lines of credit. This company’s suite of services is appealing, but its customer service is somewhat lacking. Customer representatives can be reached via phone, email, and support ticket. But there’s no live chat or mobile app available, and its website doesn’t offer many educational resources. There also aren’t many customer reviews of the company online.

To effectively rebuild your credit, take the time tofind the right companyfor your specific situation. If you’d prefer not to work with a credit repair service, you can repair your credit on your own. While this process can take time, it could be worth it for those who have minor credit issues that need fixing. All three credit bureaus let you dispute inaccurate or incomplete information on your credit reports, and you can choose to dispute online or by mail. Most also offer dispute letter templates that you can download and use. Working on your financial habits can also help improve your credit over time. You might start by using a budgeting tool and looking at your finances to develop a budgeting system that works. This way, you’ll have a good idea of money coming in every month and how you’re spending it. Many budgeting tools also have bill tracking and payment features, which can be useful if you’re trying to stay on track with payments. If you’re interested in repairing your credit on your own, check out these resources: If you discover a mistake or outdated information on your credit report, you can follow the three-step process outlined below to dispute the error. You'll want to dispute the error(s) with each credit bureau that has the mistake. You can contact the major credit bureaus online, by mail, or by phone. If you decide to dispute by mail, then you can fill out a sample letter from theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)or theFederal Trade Commission (FTC). In your letter, you'll want to include your contact information, a request that the incorrect or inaccurate information be removed or corrected, each mistake you want fixed (and why), copies of any supporting documents, and a copy of the relevant report (with the mistake(s) circled). You'll then have to dispute the incorrect or inaccurate information with the business that provided it. TheCFPBand theFTCeach provide template letters for contacting these businesses as well. Your letter should specify that you're disputing one or more errors, and it should include your complete name and address, each mistake you want fixed (and why), and copies of any supporting documents. After all letters have been sent, you should keep a close eye on your credit report(s) to ensure that each bureau has removed the incorrect or inaccurate information. Should the business that reported the erroneous information continue to do so, check that each credit bureau has placed a notice that you're disputing the information. If you're interested in fixing your credit score on your own, then following the steps listed below can put you on the right path without having to pay the sizable fees that credit repair companies often charge: By law, the three major credit bureaus are each required to provide you with a free copy of your credit report once per year.Ideally, you should check your credit reports fromoneof the bureaus every four months. Review each report to identify any possible mistakes. If you do find one or more errors on your credit report, you should file a dispute with the respective credit bureau as soon as possible. The credit bureau will remove or update any mistakes and, while it's not a guarantee, this may improve your score. One of the best things you can do to improve your credit score is to make payments on any outstanding debt you have. The reason for this is twofold: Firstly, payment history accounts for 35% (the largest share) of your FICO score, so paying your bills on time is the best thing you can do to fix your credit. If you're already late on any payments, bring any past-due accounts current as soon as possible—the longer you wait, the harder it'll be to repair the damage. Secondly, the amount of debt you owe is responsible for 30% of your FICO score, so keeping your credit utilization ratio low will also improve your score.If you can't afford to make payments on your outstanding debts, reach out to your lender about hardship options immediately. This may seem to contradict the above point, but the amount of time you've had an account open is viewed positively by lenders. It's not as important as paying down your debt (with account history only composing 15% of your FICO score), but keeping your credit card accounts open and your credit utilization low (as opposed to not using any credit) are both still good strategies for improving a bad credit score. Products likecredit builder loans, which are specifically designed to help build (or rebuild) your credit, and secured loans or credit cards, which are easier for borrowers with poor credit to qualify for due to being backed by collateral, offer opportunities to show financial responsibility to the three major credit bureaus. As you make on-time payments on these smaller loans/lines of credit, your positive payment history will slowly improve your credit score over time. As you shop around for credit repair companies, you’ll likely notice that different companies offer slightly different services, pricing, and customer service options. Here’s what to look for as you compare options and narrow down your choices. Credit repair companies will engage with the credit bureaus and creditors to help get misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate information removed from yourcredit reports. The goal is to clean up your payment history, which is the largest factor that affects your credit score. While a credit repair company typically doesn’t do anything you can’t do on your own, these services can be helpful if you need significant assistance with your credit. For instance, if you have several accounts to deal with or lots of errors on your credit reports, a credit repair company could be a good option for you. Disputing all of the issues on your own may be too time-consuming or overwhelming, especially if you’re dealing with significant financial stress. The exact timeline of how long it'll take to repair someone's credit can vary from person to person. However, on average, the full process typically requires roughly three to six months. During this period, you'll hopefully see graduate improvements as more and more negative marks on your credit score are removed.As the credit bureaus have 30 to 45 days to investigate disputes, plus an additional five business days to submit their findings to you, you may not see any results until after this investigative period passes. The degree to which credit repair can improve your credit score will almost entirely depend on how many errors there are. Remember, credit repair companies can't do anything to get accurate information removed from your credit report. So if there are little to no errors, the effects of credit repair will be minimal. However, if there are many errors (or the erroneous claims are particularly detrimental), then you could see a big improvement. There are several factors to compare as you shop around for the right credit repair services, including: If you’re thinking about working with a credit repair service, it’s important to choose a reputable option. Unfortunately, there are some shady companies in this industry eager to take advantage of financially vulnerable consumers, so doing your due diligence is essential. Each company on our list is reputable and abides byCredit Repair Organizations Act (CROA)regulations, but if you’d like to shop around further, you can start by looking at theCFPB Complaint Database. This database lets you review complaints about companies that consumers have logged with the CFPB since 2011. However, a lack of complaints doesn’t necessarily indicate a good company reputation—a company must respond to a complaint for it to be listed on the CFPB, so companies can avoid listings by not responding. While it may be tempting to use services like the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to research companies, that’s generally not the best approach. Companies can pay to become accredited on the BBB platform, which could make them seem more legitimate than they actually are. We've carefully looked into and researched each of the businesses that we recommend listed above to ensure that they're legitimate credit repair companies. If you suspect a credit repair company you’ve come across is scamming customers or otherwise engaged in fraud, you canreport them to the FTC. Some people prefer to work with local companies rather than connect with a company online. While discussing issues about your credit can feel embarrassing, a recommendation from a trusted loved one may provide peace of mind that the company you’re working with is legitimate.As you compare options, search for company complaints in the CFPB database, review company websites and contact information, and research consumer review sites for insight. If possible, opt for companies that offer a free consultation so you can get a better sense of their services. Working with a local company can be helpful if you’d like to speak with someone in person. But be aware that your options may be more limited depending on where you’re located. While working with a credit repair company can be a good option for improving your credit score, it's just one of many possible solutions, and it won't be the right fit for everyone. Outside of trying to repair your credit on your own, you can consider seeking credit counseling or a debt settlement company. Acredit counselingagency often offers many of the same benefits that a credit repair company typically does, including reaching out to creditors on your behalf. Its primary function, however, is to work with you directly to devise money management strategies that'll help you avoid bankruptcy. After analyzing your income, expenses, and debts, a credit counselor will provide advice and plans tailored to your financial situation.Working with one of these organizations can be a good alternative to a credit repair company if you know your credit report is accurate and primarily need help with budgeting, managing spending, and controlling debt. Credit counselors are often nonprofit or not-for-profit agencies and, as such, many charge low fees (or nothing at all) for their services.This isn't always the case, however, so be sure to review what fees you may be charged, in addition to whether an agency will put a comment that you worked with them on your credit report (which could make you seem like a credit risk to prospective lenders). Debt settlementcompanies are typically for-profit entities that work with creditors on your behalf. The biggest difference between debt settlement companies and credit repair companies is that the former negotiate with creditors to arrange settlements or even debt forgiveness on your behalf, whereas not all of the latter will contact your creditors for you, and those that do usually only do so to dispute errors on your credit report. The main thing they have in common, however, is that neither type of company offers anything that you can't do yourself. In fact, some creditors will refuse to negotiate with debt settlement companies.Additionally, even if a company is able to have your debt reduced or forgiven, you will likely have to pay income taxes on the amount that was settled, and a debt settlement can remain on your credit report for seven years. Legitimate companies offering something as enticing as debt forgiveness have also made this field fraught with scams. Be on the lookout for companies that promise fast debt settlements or try to charge fees upfront before they actually succeed in reducing your debt.Additionally, if a company instructs you to provide inaccurate or false personal information, illegally use an Employer Identification Number (EIN) instead of your Social Security Number (SSN), or do something else fraudulent when applying for credit, then you're dealing with a scam. Credit repair company costs can vary heavily, as different companies have different pricing structures. When you hire a credit repair company, you'll typically be charged a monthly fee. Prices can range from $19.00 to $149.00 per month, depending on the service you select. Instead of charging a monthly fee, some credit repair companies use a performance-based billing model, wherein a client is charged a fee for each item on their credit report that the company challenges. Some companies will only charge you if they successfully have a negative mark deleted from your report, while others will levy a fee regardless of a challenge's success. Additionally, if a single error appears on more than one of your credit reports, a performance-based credit repair company may treat that as several items for billing purposes. In addition to the sticker price of the service you choose, there may also be enrollment fees that would increase the overall cost. You have a right to cancel a credit repair service at any time,though you may be charged a cancellation fee. Under the federal CROA, a credit repair company can neither request nor receive payment until it's completed the services it's promised to provide.If a company tries to get you to pay fees upfront before completing the promised service, you may be dealing with a scam. Investopedia collected and analyzed a wide range of key data points from several credit repair companies to identify the most important factors for readers choosing the right service to suit their needs. We used this data to review each company for costs and fees, services offered, customer experiences, and other features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best credit repair companies since 2020. Working with a credit repair service may be the fastest way to repair your credit if you need significant assistance. While these services generally don’t provide a set time frame for improvement, many will start working on your credit right after you sign up. However, even if a company starts work quickly, it can still take a few months or even longer to see changes in your credit reports and score. There are legitimate credit repair companies that, if hired, may be able to help improve your score by removing inaccurate information from your credit report. However, the industry is also full of scam artists posing as legitimate credit repair companies. If you encounter a business that promises it can remove all negative information from your credit report (including accurate information), requires you to pay them upfront, or suggests you dispute information you know is correct, you're almost certainly dealing with a scam. Yes, it’s possible for credit repair companies toremove bankruptcies and collection accountsin certain instances. If you’ve paid off the debt, they could send a goodwill deletion request on your behalf. Or, if the account information is inaccurate or outdated, the credit repair service could file a dispute letter to get it removed. For instance, Chapter 13 bankruptcies are supposed to be removed from your credit reports after seven years. Credit repair companiescanwork. Good credit repair companies will work on your behalf to have incorrect information removed from your credit report, potentially boosting your score as a result. However, if the information hurting your score is accurate, then there's nothing they can do to change that. Additionally, credit repair companies don't do anything you couldn't do by yourself. Outside of working with a credit repair company, there are a few different things you can do to fix a bad credit score. First, request a copy of your free credit report from one of the three major credit bureaus. Review your report, and if you find any errors, dispute that negative information with the respective bureau.Next, continue to make consistent, on-time payments on any concurrent debt you have. Be sure to prioritize paying off any overdue balances you may have. Once you've got a handle on your existing debt, then you may want to consider taking out new debt to improve your credit mix, but only do so if you're certain you can handle the additional payments. As there is more than one credit score model, the exact range of where a \"good\" credit score falls will vary. With a FICO score, one of the most commonly used models, borrowers in the 670 to 739 range are considered to have good credit, while 740–799 indicates a \"very good\" credit history. Anyone with a score of 800 or more has an \"excellent\" rating, and scores between 580-669 and those below 580 are considered \"fair\" and \"poor,\" respectively. Using the FICO model, any credit score below 580 is considered \"poor,\" which is the lowest credit rating. Credit scores between 580-669 are often lumped into the \"bad\" category alongside poor scores. 300 is the lowest possible credit score most models allow for.

    "news_title": "Watch These Bitcoin Price Levels as Investors Load Up on Bitcoin ETFs",
    "news_content": "Costfoto / NurPhoto via Getty Images Bitcoin (BTC) could make more headlines today as the leading cryptocurrency’s price hovers around a three-month high just below the closely watched $67,000 mark. The digital asset, currently around 6% higher this week, has received a boost in recent days from significant inflows intospot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs). So far this week, the 12 U.S. funds have amassed nearly $1.4 billion in net inflows, with the ETFs on track to recordstrong weekly inflows. The surge in ETF inflows indicate that the Federal Reserve’s half-percentage-point cut to its benchmark funds rate last month may berenewing investor optimismfor the broader asset class. Below, we’ll take a close look at thetechnicalson Bitcoin’s chart and point out key price levels to watch for. Since topping out in early March, Bitcoin’s price has oscillated within asymmetrical triangle, potentiallyconsolidatingbefore breaking out above the pattern to continue a longer-term uptrend. However, it’s worth pointing out thattrading volumeson Coinbase (COIN), the largest U.Scrypto exchange, have trended lower in recent months, indicating that many investors may still be on the sidelines, waiting for a decisivebreakout. Let’s turn to Bitcoin’s chart to forecast several potentialprice targetsabove the cryptocurrency’s record high and identify two keysupport levelsinvestors may be watching. To project our first upside target, we’ll use themeasuring principle. This works by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and adding that figure to the pattern’s top trendline. For example, we add $24,000 to $68,500, which forecasts a price target of $92,500, around 38% above Bitcoin’s current price. When forecasting a longer-term bullish move, we can apply a bars pattern. Such a technique uses historicaltrendson the chart to speculate how a future directional move may play out. In this case, we’ll take Bitcoin’s strong trend higher that preceded the symmetrical triangle and reposition it from last month’s low, which projects an upside target of around $135,000. Investors should monitor how the price responds to the keypsychological$60,000 level. This area on the chart could find support from the symmetrical triangle’s lower trendline and a range of comparable trading levels positioned around the cryptocurrency’s 2021 peak. Abreakdownbelow the symmetrical triangle could see Bitcoin’s price drop to around $44,000, where investors may look for buying opportunities near ahorizontal linelinking a series ofprice actionfrom February 2021 to January this year.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Has Outperformed the S&P 500 Since September—Here's Why",
    "news_content": "Mrinalini Krishna is the Senior Editor of investing news at Investopedia. She's been a journalist for more than 10 years covering business, personal finance, and investing news. Thomas Trutschel / Contributor / Getty Images Bitcoin (BTCUSD), though volatile, has outstripped the returns of theS&P 500since the beginning of September. The largest cryptocurrency has benefited from investor optimism driven by theFederal Reserve's rate cuts and the U.S. presidential elections, among other factors. Since the beginning of September, bitcoin has gained more than 14%, while the S&P 500 has risen roughly 3%. Justlike stocks, bitcoin didn't have a particularly great start to September after a worse-than-expected jobs report raised concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. Bitcoin was trading below $60,000 at that time, but signals from the Fed about a potential rate cut coming soon helped the cryptocurrency gain some momentum. The Fed announced a jumbo50-basis-point rate cuton Sept. 18 and set expectations for more to come, sendingbitcoin higher. Lower rates translate into lower yields for Treasurys, and that makes riskier assets such as bitcoin more attractive to investors. Still, macroeconomic uncertainty weighs on bitcoin. Any economic data that suggests that the Fed could deviate from its rate-cutting cycle or that a recession is imminent has the power to derail this bitcoin rally. There may also have been some sudden shift out of crypto assets into Chinese equities after the government there announced ablockbuster stimulus package in late September, but that trade has lost some steam as the optimism around more measures began fading. Bitcoin traded around $68,000 Wednesday after three robust days of inflows for bitcoinexchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to data from Farside Investors, bitcoin ETFs have seen nearly $1.2 billion in net inflows since last Friday. U.S. presidential elections have also played a role in bitcoin price movements this year. \"The macro factors contributing to crypto performance are currently rotating away from monetary policy concerns to US election outcomes,\" wrote researchers at Coinbase last week. As part of a campaign agenda released Monday, Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris mentioned \"supporting a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets.\" Though there were no other details, this was the first time the Harris campaign has showed some support for the crypto industry, while her opponent former President Donald Trump has done so on many occasions. \"She knows crypto exists, it matters, and it isn't going away. But it's not the full-hearted embrace that crypto advocates have been hoping for,\" Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer for Bitwise, wrote in a commentary Tuesday, adding that \"little sliver of good news was enough to send bitcoin up 5%. Enough to push more than $500 million into bitcoin ETFs.\" Another recent boost for bitcoin prices came from failed cryptocurrency exchangeMt. Gox. In a recent notification, the exchange said that it willrepay customersof a decade-old hack by October 2025 instead of the the end of this month. Many market watchers were concerned about bitcoin prices dropping fast with a huge amount of bitcoin hitting the markets as the repayments began in June. \"This could assuage near term concerns around supply,\" wrote Coinbase researchers, who also noted that prior movements in bitcoin wallets associated with Mt. Gox have led to sudden declines in bitcoin prices. Farside Investors. \"Bitcoin ETF Flow – All Data (US$m).\" KamalaHarris.com. \"Kamala Harris Will Deliver For Black Men.\" Bitwise. \"Crypto Is Not Going To Wait for the Election.\" Coinbase. \"Weekly: Uptober’s Obstacles.\"",

The price of bitcoin was recently near $66,000, rising some 6% over the past 24 hours according to CoinDesk data. That helped shares of companies like crypto exchange Coinbase, major bitcoin holder MicroStrategy (MSTR) and crypto mining company Marathon Digital (MARA). Coinbase stock was recently up about 9%. The moves came as broader markets, including the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite,rose to start the week. They have bitcoin trading around recent highs, though a bit below their highest points of 2024. They also follow a policy statement from Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, citing support for “a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets.” The statement, along with previous comments from former President Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, could signal Washington may move toward a more crypto-friendly outlook regardless of who wins the election.Trump in recent days has used social media to promote the coming sale of a crypto token. Coinbase is set to report its latest quarterly results at the end of the month. Kamala Harris. \"Vice President Harris Will Deliver for Black Men.\" X Platform. “@realDonaldTrump, 12:07 p.m. Oct. 12, 2024.” Coinbase. “Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.”",

    "news_content": "Silas Stein / picture alliance via Getty Images Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com on Tuesday sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over concern that the SEC's actions overstep legal boundaries and undermine the future of the crypto industry in the U.S. According toCrypto.com, the lawsuit follows aWells Noticeissued in August by the SEC to the company, which is a letter that indicates the SEC's intention to bring an enforcement case against the crypto startup. The crux of Crypto.com's lawsuit contends that the SEC has unilaterally expanded its jurisdiction beyond the limits established by law, particularly by classifying most crypto transactions as securities dealings. The company contends that thisregulatory positionis applied inconsistently, exempting bitcoin (BTCUSD) andether(ETHUSD) despite their perceived similarity to other crypto assets.Crypto.comalso emphasized in the suit that the SEC bypassed key procedural steps, including the notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act. By filing this suit, Crypto.com said it aims to halt what it views as the SEC’s \"unlawful\" campaign against the crypto industry. Additionally, Crypto.com has filed a petition with theCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)and the SEC to establish a clearer regulatory framework for cryptocurrency derivatives in the U.S. Blockchain technology firmConsensys also filed a preemptive lawsuit against the SECearlier this year after receiving a Wells Notice.

    "news_title": "XRP Falls After SEC Appeals 2023 Ruling That Said The Token Was Not a Security",
    "news_content": "Omar Marques / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images The price of the XRP token fell by as much as 11% Thursday following the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision to appeala federal court ruling last yearthat found XRP (XRPUSD) is not a security when algorithmically sold toretail investorsvia exchanges.XRP has since given up some of those losses and was trading roughly 3% lower at 52 cents in recent trading. This ruling had been seen as a partial victory for XRP's developer,Ripple Labs, and the broader crypto industry, with U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres stating in the July 2023 order that theXRP tokenitself is not a security. However, the the court did viewinstitutionalXRP sales as unregistered securities offerings. The SEC’s renewed push against Ripple continues after it initially sought $2 billion in damages in the case, although the court ordered Ripple to pay only a$125 million penalty. \"TheSEC's decision to appeal is disappointing, but not surprising,\" Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty posted late Wednesday on the social media platform X in response to the SEC's court filing. This legal development came just hours after crypto asset manager Bitwisefiledto offer for the first spot XRP ETF Wednesday. The SEC's appeal likely weakens the potential for the proposed spot XRP ETF to be approved anytime soon. CourtListener. \"SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION - against - RIPPLE LABS, INC., BRADLEY GARLINGHOUSE, and CHRISTIAN A. LARSEN.\" X Platform. \"@s_alderoty, 5:47 PM, Oct 2, 2024.\"",

    "news_title": "Bitwise Files for First XRP Exchange-Traded Fund",
    "news_content": "SOPA Images / Getty Images Crypto index fund manager Bitwise on Wednesday filed anS-1registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would give investors direct exposure to Ripple Labs's XRP (XRPUSD) crypto token. In the filing, Bitwise explicitly stated thatXRPisn't a security—countering pastSEC assertions—and emphasized that XRP operates on adecentralizedledger, which generally can enhance accountability, security, and accessibility. According to the filing,BNY Mellonwill serve as the trust’s administrator andtransfer agent, while Coinbase Custody will act as the custodian. The filing comes at a time when theSEC is still in a legal disputewithRippleover the classification of XRP as an unregistered security. The SEC has until Monday, Oct. 7, to appeal a 2023 federal court ruling that secondary sales of XRP through crypto exchanges aren't securities transactions. According to Galaxy Digital's head of research, Alex Thorn, it would be surprising if the SEC doesn't appeal the decision. Such an appeal's success would make the chances of approval for thisETFproposal effectively zero, he posted Tuesday on the social media platform X. Bitwise acknowledged the continuing litigation in its filing, noting that if XRP is deemed a security by the courts, it could force the liquidation of the proposed trust under certain conditions. In addition to this new filing for an XRP ETF, Bitwise has already launchedspot bitcoinand ether ETFs in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Bitwise XRP ETF.\" X Platform. \"@intangiblecoins, 4:33 PM, Oct 1, 2024.\" Bitwise Asset Management. \"Crypto Funds Backed by Crypto Specialists.\"",

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Price Levels to Watch as Cryptocurrency Falls Monday After Strong Month",
    "news_content": "Bitcoin (BTC) lost ground Monday morning, giving back some of the gains posted during what has been a positive month for the legacy cryptocurrency. Gains in recent weeks have been driven in part by the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut in four years and the announcement by Chinese authorities of wide-ranging economic stimulus measures. Despite Monday's decline, bitcoin is still up about 8% since the start of September, a month when its performance typically lags. Below, we take a closer look at bitcoin’s chart and usetechnical analysisto point out important price levels to watch out for heading into October. Bitcoin’s prince has oscillated within a multi-monthdescending channelsince setting its record high in March. More recently, after bottoming out earlier this month towards the pattern’s lower trendline, the cryptocurrency’s price has staged an impressive rally to the formation’s opposing trendline, reclaiming the the closely watched200-day moving average (MA)in the process. Amid the potential for abreakoutabove the descending channel, we’ll point out several key overhead price levels to keep in mind, while also identifying a keysupportarea to watch out for during potential retracements. The first level to keep track of sits around $68,500, a location just above the channel’s upper trendline where the price may encounterresistancenear twin peaks that took shape throughout July. A rally above this level could see the cryptocurrency’s price move up to the $72,000 level, where investors who bought at lower prices could look tolock in profitsnear multiple peaks just below theall-time high (ATH)that formed on the chart between March and early June. To project aprice targetabove the ATH, we can use a bars pattern. To do this, we take bitcoin’s trending move higher from January to March and position it from this month’s low, which forecasts an upside target of around $97,000. We selected this prior move as it followed apullbackof around 22%, not unlike the current bullish move, which started after a 19% dip. Upon a retracement from the descending channel’s upper trendline, investors should eye the $60,600 level, an area where bitcoin’s price finds aconfluenceof support from the 50-day MA and a trendline linking a series of comparable trading levels from February to September.

    "news_title": "How the Fed's Rate Cuts Could Shave Millions in Stablecoin Issuer Income",
    "news_content": "Silas Stein / picture alliance via Getty Images Stablecoin issuers could be looking at lower income as the Federal Reserve (Fed) kicked off its first rate cut cycle since 2020. Each 50 basis point cut by the Fed could lead to a $625 million drop in total annual interest income forstablecoinissuers, according to a new report from digital asset data provider CCData. Those hits could quickly add up as theFed itself expects cutstotaling 50 basis points by the end of this year, and another 100 basis points by the end of next year. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to another cryptocurrency. Some of the most popular stablecoins have their value pegged to the U.S. dollar and keep a reserve in cash or equivalent investments—often U.S. Treasurys—to maintain that peg. Centralized stablecoin providers, such asTether(USDTUSD) andCircle(USDCUSD), have relied heavily on their holdings of U.S.Treasurysearning interest over the past few years as high interest rates drove up Treasury yields. U.S. Treasurys make up the vast majority of reserves held by stablecoin issuers, at just over 80%. This amounts to holdings of nearly $125 billion worth of Treasurys. Tether, the largest stablecoin by market cap, alone holds $93.2 billion worth of U.S. debt, which accounted for much of that digital asset company's $5.2 billion of profits in the first half of 2024, the CCData report said. Bitcoin.com Director of Engineering Andrei Terentiev speculated on social media that lower interest rates could eventually push stablecoin providers and other financial institutions intoriskier assetsin an effort to earn a return on their reserves. \"With lower yields on safer assets, institutions often shift their focus toward 'risk-on' assets,\" Terentiev posted on the platform X.\"Think stocks, crypto, and other investments that offer higher potential returns but come with greater risk,\" he wrote. CCData. \"Stablecoins & CBDCs Report - September 2024,\" Page 16. X Platform. \"@andrei_rwa, 12:11 PM, Sept, 23, 2024.\"",

    "news_content": "KTSDESIGN/ SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / Getty Images The price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) jumped over $63,000 Thursday following a Federal Reserveinterest-rate cut. The Fed's yearslong fight against inflation saw rates rise to a 23-year high. Wednesday's cut, the first of this cycle, boosted investor confidence in bitcoin, driving prices higher. The Fed cutting rates \"may be a welcome development for bitcoin bulls,\" FXTM Senior Market Analyst Lukman Otunuga said, adding that a signal of looser financial conditions can boost the appetite for riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin'sprice rosein the immediate aftermath of the Fed announcement and continued its upward trajectory in recent trading. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which holds more than 244,000 bitcoins worth over $15 billion at today's prices, saw its shares jump 11% Thursday. The company on Wednesday announced plans for a $700 million debt offering to add more bitcoins to its coffers. Other beneficiaries of bitcoin's recent price rise include crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), which was up 6% on Thursday, and bitcoin miner Marathon (MARA), which sawits shares gain more than 4%. Grayscale Head of Research Zach Pandl said out that the Fed;s decision to cut rates came despite inflation risks remaining somewhat elevated. \"Central banks’ willingness to take risks with inflation tends to drive investors to store-of-value assets, like gold and Bitcoin,\" said Pandl, adding that despite choppy markets immediately after the announcement, \"over time bitcoin will benefit from lower rates and a weaker dollar.\" A negative economic outlook from the Fed could lead to a bitcoin reversal even in cases where rates are cut further, Otunuga said. MicroStrategy. \"MicroStrategy Announces Proposed Private Offering of $700 Million of Convertible Senior Notes.\"",

Its price is still below its nearly $58,000 level on Wednesday. Thefluctuationshave taken stocks tied to the cryptocurrency sector along for the ride. Shares of Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange operator, had improved 4% by Monday afternoon, while MicroStrategy, a software company withsizable Bitcoin holdings, surged 8%. Like Bitcoin, however, they haven’t returned to last week’s levels. The share prices of Cleanspark (CLSK) and Marathon Digital (MARA), whichmine Bitcoin, tell a similar story.  Cleanspark has added 5% Monday afternoon, and Marathon Digital's price has increased by 9%.

He has more than three years of experience editing, proofreading, and fact-checking content on current financial events and politics. He received his M.A. in journalism from The New School and his B.A. in history and political science from McGill University. Doug Mills/The New York Times/Bloomberg via Getty Images Investors cast votes on a range of politically connected assets following last night's presidential debate, giving a lift to some alternative-energy shares and dragging on cryptocurrencies. Prediction markets generally indicated a higher expectation of a victory by Vice President Kamala Harris victory after the debate, with Polymarket still predicting a win for former President Donald Trump and PredictIt increasing its likelihood of a Harris one. Over 90 minutes, the pair sparred onthe economy, immigration, abortion, the cost of living, and campaign rally turnouts. Subsequently, shares of Truth Social parent company Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), which often acts as a proxy for views of Trump's reelection chances,tumbledsome 12%, trading at some of its lowest levels ever. The stock, which has a tinyfloat, is notoriously volatile. Cryptocurrencies, another asset class seen as likely to benefit from a Trump presidency, also slumped. The price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) declined from about $57,650 at the start of the debate to about $56,880 when it ended. Its price continued to slide overnight, and it traded as low as $56,130 early Wednesday. Harris’s performance gave a boost to clean energy stocks, which were among the S&P 500’s top performers Wednesday. Harris, if elected President, is widely expected to continue President Biden’s green energy agenda. Lithium mining giant Albemarle (ALB) jumped 11% on Wednesday, while solar panel maker First Solar (FSLR) and green energy utility AES Corp. (AES) advanced 12% and 7%, respectively. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) traded 5% higher despite an inflation report that tempered the market’s expectations for interest rate cuts. Solar stocks are believed to be particularly sensitive to interest rates because demand from residential customers hinges on low borrowing costs and a healthy housing market.",

    "news_title": "Watch These Key Bitcoin Price Levels as Jobs Report, Fed Rate Decision Loom",
    "news_content": "Bitcoin (BTC) lost ground in early trading on Friday after closing more than 3% lower yesterday as investors braced for the highly anticipatedAugust jobs reportdue this morning, a key piece in the puzzle for gauging the timing and size of widely expected interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve later this month. Although market participants anticipate a reduction of 25basis pointsin the influential federal funds rate, a weaker-than-expected reading on employment may increase the possibility of a 50-basis-point cut. Rate cuts could provide a boost to the legacy cryptocurrency, which has fallen around 24% since setting itsrecord highon March 14 amid a lack of new narratives to drive bullishsentiment. Below, we’ll dial in on Bitcoin’stechnicalsand locate importantsupport and resistancechart levels to watch out for. Bitcoin’s price has oscillated within an orderlychannel-like pattern since topping out in March this year, testing therangebound-period’s upper and lower trendlines on multiple occasions over the past six months. However, more recently, a rally from the channel’s lower levels last month fizzled around the200-day moving average (MA), with the cryptocurrency now trading back towards the pattern’s lower trendline. Bitcoin was trading around $56,000 Friday morning. It’s also worth pointing out that Bitcoinvolumeson Coinbase (COIN), the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, remain significantly lower compared to earlier in the year, raising the possibility for sudden price fluctuations due to reduced liquidity. Looking ahead, investors should monitor several key areas on Bitcoin’s chart likely to command attention. If Bitcoin’s price continues to grind lower, keep an eye on the $53,000 level, a location on the chart just below the channel’s lower trendline where the cryptocurrency could find support near a range of narrowconsolidationthat followed an impulsive move higher in early February. Abreakdownbelow this important technical level opens the door for a decline to the $47,000 area, where Bitcoin bulls may step in to defend a range of comparable trading levels positioned slightly below the Januaryswing high. Upon an upsidereversal, investors should monitor the $65,000 level. A rally into this area would likely face resistance from both last month’s high and the flattening 200-day MA. A successful close above this level could see Bitcoin’s price revisit the $68,500 area, where traders who have bought recent lows may be happy tolock in profitsnear the channel’s upper trendline and July peak.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Dropped As Low As $56K Amid Nvidia-Driven Stock Sell-Off",
    "news_content": "Investopedia / Illustration by Alice Morgan / Getty Images Bitcoin prices (BTCUSD) dropped to $56,000 Wednesday morning amid abroader stock sell-offled by declines in market heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) before clawing back some of those losses later in the day. Investors are not just getting nervous about the cryptocurrency; bitcoin exchange-traded funds also saw $287.8 million in outflows on Tuesday, the fifth straight day of net outflows in a row, according to Farside Investors. The most recent bitcoin price drop also correlates withsell-offs in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has made some question the crypto asset's effectiveness as a hedge. According to data fromThe Block, bitcoin has moved more in tandem with the traditional stock market than gold lately, despite its touted use case as a safe-haven asset. Bitcoin'sPearson correlationwith the Nasdaq went as high as 0.9 in June (on a scale from 0 to 1) and came into the spotlight amid the equities sell-offroughly one month ago. Although Bitcoin's correlation with stocks has reduced slightly since then, it remained above 0.5 as of last week, while the crypto asset's correlation with gold became slightly inverted. Approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and optimism aroundthe bitcoin halvingthat took place earlier this year drove bitcoin's price to a new high of over $73,000 in March. But the Federal Reserve could play a bigger role in how Bitcoin heads next. As the Fed raised rates to combat inflation, yields on U.S. Treasurys rose and became more attractive to investors than riskier assets such as stocks and bitcoin. A rate cut could benefit those assets as yields come down. However, analysts from crypto exchange Bitfinex predict more pain for bitcoin with a potential 15% to 20% bitcoin sell-off in the cards following a rate cut from the Federal Reserve later this month. \"Since early August, Bitcoin has gained over 32%, driven by traders anticipating dovish comments by the Federal Reserve,\" the Bitfinex analysts wrote in their report. \"A more aggressive 50 basis point cut might cause an immediate price spike but could be followed by a correction as recession concerns escalate.\" Bitcoin was trading above $58,000 in recent trading. Farside Investors. \"Bitcoin ETF Flow.\" The Block. \"BTC Pearson Correlation (30D).\" Bitfinex. \"Bitfinex Alpha Issue 02-09-2024.\"",
