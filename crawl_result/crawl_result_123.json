    "news_content": "Ontario Provincial Police are warning residents in the Ottawa Valley of a cryptocurrency scam circulating in the area, after an elderly resident lost almost $10,000. Police say the victim was contacted by phone and coached to deposit money into a cryptocurrency ATM with the promise of a “high investment return.” “Which never materialized.” Police released no other details about the alleged scam, including when it happened or where in the Ottawa Valley the resident lived. “These scams can also involve fraudsters setting up a fake cryptocurrency investment company. These companies can have a very convincing online presence with a professional-looking website, social media accounts and reviews and testimonials by ‘satisfied customers,’” the OPP said. “Once they lure potential victims, they will use high-pressure sales tactics and the promise of high returns to convince the victims to invest ever-increasing amounts of money.” The OPP offers the following tips to avoid being a victim to a cryptocurrency scam: The OPP says if you are, or suspect you may be, the victim of a cryptocurrency investment fraud, contact your local police, notify your bank and save any information that may assist the investigation, including bank account numbers that funds were transferred to.
