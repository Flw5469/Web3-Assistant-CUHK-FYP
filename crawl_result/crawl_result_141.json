    "news_title": "DTX Exchange Crowned Q4 Best Presale After Hitting $6M – Will it Reach $1 Before TRON (TRX) and Cardano (ADA)? | Bitcoinist.com",
    "news_content": "The crypto market shoots upward, same as the ICO world, a hunting ground for low-cap gems and the next crypto unicorns. With the final quarter underway,DTX Exchange (DTX)has been hailed as Q4’s best presale after hitting $6 million in early funding. Alreadypre-listed on CoinMarketCapand its market debut fast approaching, it has been tipped to reach $1 before TRON (TRX) and Cardano (ADA). Considering its current price of $0.08, this might be the best new crypto to invest in. DTX Exchange (DTX)is an investor favorite for several reasons, from its hybrid approach to trading to its substantial upside potential. Unlike conventional trading platforms, it will combine the best elements of decentralized and centralized exchanges, offering the best of both worlds. Over 120,000 asset classes can be traded across traditional finance and DeFi, setting it up to transform the$3.2 billion global trading market. The key aspects of the DTX Exchange protocol besides its hybrid model include smart contracts for secure and automated transactions, an on-chain order book for transparency and distributed liquidity pools. The above, alongside its growth prospects, has sparked a presale frenzy—over $6 million has been raised in funding. In round 4 of the ICO, a token is priced at $0.08 and is tipped by experts to hit $1 after listing on Tier-1 exchanges. Primed to outclass popular names like TRON (TRX) and Cardano (ADA), it is a new DeFi project to watch out for. The Layer-1 token TRON (TRX) has been impressive this year. It registered a 70% uptick on the yearly chart, outperforming many top altcoins. Its rapidly growing meme ecosystem, thanks to the launch of SunPump, a memepad, has been crucial to its growth this year. Spurred by TRON (TRX) memes, it exploded over 23% in the past 90 days, registering an annual high of $0.167 in late August. It maintains bullish traction as theTRON priceis above $0.164, gearing up for another yearly peak. Meanwhile, a TRON price prediction suggests a jump above the 2018 all-time high of $0.3. While flipping this level might play out, critics believe a rally above $1 is almost impossible. Between its total supply of 86 billion tokens and a large market cap of $14 billion, there is just so much growth it can experience. Cardano (ADA) is one of the top 15 cryptocurrencies and top crypto coins. As a key player in the Layer-1 ecosystem, it assists with creating decentralized applications (dApps), becoming a favorite destination for DeFi services. However, considering rising competition and dwindling investor interest, Cardano (ADA) swings low. TheCardano pricetumbled over 10% on the monthly chart, changing hands above $0.34. The past 7 days aren’t any different—a 4% downturn. While a bearish Cardano price prediction hints at a potential correction below $0.25, a bullish outlook suggests a bounce. Considering the upcoming US election and the possibility of a Trump presidency—which many believe will be bullish for crypto—ADA might soar above $0.75 before the year’s end, positioning it as a good crypto to buy. Following its remarkable presale performance—raising over $6 million in funding—DTX Exchange (DTX) basks in the spotlight. Its novelty as the world’s first hybrid trading platform where assets across TradFi and DeFi can be traded, alongside its huge growth prospects, drives interest and demand. Tipped to reach $1 before TRON (TRX) and Cardano (ADA), it is a promising wave not to miss.
