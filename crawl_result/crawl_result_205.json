    "news_title": "Assessing Cardano’s $0.37 Price Wall Under Pressure",
    "news_content": "The Currency analytics Cryptocurrency News – REAL News ® – TCAT Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, has been facing a period of stagnation, trading within a narrow range of $0.34 to $0.36 this month. This plateau follows a more positive momentum observed in late September, when ADA managed to form a higher high. However, recent market fluctuations, particularly in Bitcoin’s price, have raised questions about whether Cardano can maintain its critical support level at $0.37.  On October 23, Bitcoin experienced a slight correction, dipping to a weekly low of $66,300 before bouncing back to reclaim the $68,000 mark. This correction had a ripple effect across the altcoin market, including Cardano, which suffered as bullish traders struggled to reach the $0.40 psychological target. The sentiment among traders shifted as they assessed the impact of Bitcoin’s movements on altcoins. A look at the 4-hour chart for ADA shows a concerning trend. On October 23, ADA fell below its short-term moving averages after failing to maintain a breakout above the crucial $0.37 resistance level. The flat nature of the 50-day and 100-day moving averages indicates low volatility and uncertainty in the market. This lack of decisive movement suggests that traders are waiting for clearer signals before committing to buy or sell. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also reflects this indecision, hovering around the midpoint throughout October. This reading implies that neither buyers nor sellers are currently gaining control, making it difficult for ADA to break free from its current price range. Following the recent Chang hard fork activation on September 2, on-chain metrics from CExplorer have shown a decline in both active accounts and total transactions. This slowdown contrasts with typical expectations that such technical milestones would boost engagement and participation in the network. This downturn in on-chain activity is compounded by broader market trends. The overall crypto market has faced constraints for much of the year, making potential new investors wary of entering the space. Despite ongoing developments within Cardano’s ecosystem, the lack of engagement reflects a cautious market atmosphere. Currently, ADA is trading in a tight range, with significant resistance at the $0.37 level. If bulls can successfully break above this point, there’s potential for further upward momentum, possibly leading to the next target at $0.41. This scenario would indicate renewed interest in Cardano and may help restore some confidence among traders. Conversely, if the price slips below the lower boundary of its recent range, around $0.33, it may trigger a deeper decline, with crucial support at $0.31. This support level was previously tested on September 6 and holds significant importance for traders. As traders monitor Cardano’s movements closely, several factors will influence whether the $0.37 price wall will hold. Market sentiment, particularly related to Bitcoin’s performance, will play a crucial role. Additionally, any shifts in on-chain activity or new developments within the Cardano ecosystem could also impact price dynamics. The next few days will be critical for ADA as it seeks to either solidify its position above $0.37 or face potential declines. For those invested in or considering entering the Cardano market, keeping an eye on these indicators will be essential for making informed decisions. In summary, while the price wall at $0.37 has proven resilient so far, ongoing market pressures and declining on-chain activity raise questions about its sustainability. Only time will tell if Cardano can break through this crucial resistance and regain upward momentum.
