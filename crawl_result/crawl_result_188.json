    "news_title": "Can Cardano Beat Solana, Or Is Cutoshi Going To Do It First? | Bitcoinist.com",
    "news_content": "Cardano and Solana are often seen as two of the leading contenders in the race for crypto dominance. Both platforms have made significant improvements, with Cardano focusing on smart contracts and Solana on speed and scalability. However, a new player,Cutoshi, is entering the scene, blending the viral appeal of meme coins with real DeFi utility. As Cardano and Solana battle for market dominance, some are beginning to wonder whether Cutoshi could outpace both and become the next big name in the crypto space. Cardano has been performing poorly in the past week, falling 2% in value and 7.65% in the last 30 days. Despite this, Cardano still has the potential to beat Solana and gain a larger market cap. Looking at Cardano’s peak, it was valued at $2.94 with a market cap of $94.7 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Compared to Solana, which was valued at $89 billion at its peak. This means Cardano has already beaten Solana before in terms of market cap and can do so again if it continues expanding its ecosystem. Solana is 5th in market cap with an impressive value of $81 billion. It’s mainly known for its scalability and transaction speed, but it also has the ability to host NFTs and dApps. Cardano’s focus on a research-based approach takes the network longer to progress, unlike Solana, which can process 10,000 transactions per second at ultra-low fees. This gives Solana a competitive edge against Cardano, as developers and users prefer the lower costs. Moreover, Solana is doing well price-wise, with a 4.51% increase in the past 24 hours and a 14.85% increase in the last 7 days. During the past year, Solana has gained 447% in price, outperforming most cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, which only gained 20% in value. However, a new project called Cutoshi is gaining traction and is set to outpace Solana before Cardano. Let’s find out why this coin has so much potential. Cutoshi is unlike other meme coins as it blends humor with real DeFi functionality. So far, the project has already raised $550,000 in its 2nd stage presale. The Cutoshi DEX will connect users on multiple chains, meaning investors can trade various assets without limits. Cutoshi also removes the need for 3rd parties, so investors pay less fees and get more privacy along with security. The whole project is inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin beliefs of decentralization and privacy. It’s also heavily influenced by the Chinese lucky cat that brings good fortune and wealth, which is what Cutoshi aims to bring to investors. For those new to crypto, an academy featuring in-depth courses will be available to help them learn the basics of decentralized finance and make smarter investment choices with Cutoshi. Once Cutsohi gets listed on top exchanges, its value is likely to skyrocket and potentially bring explosive returns. As Cardano continues to develop its ecosystem to regain dominance, Solana continues to operate at ultra-low fees, gaining huge network activity and raising its price. Meanwhile, Cutoshi is merging the fun appeal of meme coins with the practical use cases of DeFi, making it stand out in the crowded meme coin market. The Cutoshi project is quickly gaining the support it needs to become a major player in the crypto space. Cutoshi is set to put Ethereum-based tokens back on the map.
