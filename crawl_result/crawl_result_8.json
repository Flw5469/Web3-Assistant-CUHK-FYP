Specifically, a bitcoin ETF allows an investor to potentially make (or lose) money based on daily fluctuations in the price of bitcoin. Unlike the asset itself, bitcoin ETFs trade on traditional stock markets or exchanges and are intended for mainstream investors who don’t wish to purchase bitcoin directly. What is the difference between bitcoin and a bitcoin ETF? There are several characteristics that make them different. These include: Proponents of bitcoin ETFs argue that these products provide a path for mainstream adoption of bitcoin that avoids some of the security and technical pitfalls of cryptocurrency ownership. Exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to the digital asset market have existed for several years, with the bulk listing outside of American markets. Canada’s first spot bitcoin ETF was listed in 2021. Europe’s first exchange-traded fund for spot bitcoin launchedthis past August. Today, the only bitcoin ETFs approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are bitcoin futures ETFs. The first products of this kind were listed in October 2021. To date, the SEC has resisted approving a spot bitcoin ETF. The first rejection came in 2017, when Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss unsuccessfully filed for a bitcoin ETF product. The SEC has argued in the past that proposed spot bitcoin ETFs — and, specifically, investors in such products — would be at at risk of market manipulation. A group of financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, are seeking SEC approval for various spot bitcoin ETFs. The coming months will tell whether the SEC has shifted its stance, especially in light of a recent court loss against crypto firm Grayscale.

    "news_title": "NFTs in action: A podcaster's unique method for engaging his fanbase - Blockworks",
    "news_content": " NFT markets may be down, but their use cases are flourishing New Africa/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions,subscribe. The total NFT market cap today is about$3.6 billion, down hugely from its heady 2022 peaks. Speculative NFT markets are dead, but the use cases of NFTs are not. Non-fungible tokens as a data format and a unique digital identifier, in the technical sense, continue to be used in productive, non-speculative ways that do not necessarily translate to a number-go-up chart. Take podcasts for instance.Pods.mediaprovides podcasters a way to easily tap into an alternative monetization stream by letting fans mint NFTs of their podcast episodes. Users mint their favorite podcast NFTs for reasons of altruism, or just because it’s no big deal to pick up a one-time free digital collectible. Since launching a year ago, Pods hasonboarded75+ podcasts and racked up more than $1 million in podcast episode mints across 120,000 collectors. One of Pods’ biggest podcasts on its platform, Mint Podcast, has seen 250k+ NFTs minted across 69,789 unique collectors. Mint Podcast has raised about$476,885in sales since it started using Pods in April 2024. $477k is not life-changing money, but it’s a tidy sum for a little-known podcast in an industry where there’s an oversaturated podcasting supply side. But the real use case of NFTs there goes beyond a simple revenue stream. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  Having pushed his podcast audience towards a simple NFT mint with Pods, Adam Levy, the face behind Mint Podcast, was able to construct a comprehensive social graph of his anonymous audience. To create a granular onchain composition, Levy targeted his 90k-strong audience with the use of Bello. The Web3 marketing analytics product, which he co-founded, spawned out of a hackathon at ETH Amsterdam. “I learned that a high percentage of my onchain audience were also Zora collectors. With that information, I was able to tap the interests of my podcast listeners (with Bello) based on their wallet onchain’s history,” Levy tells Blockworks. “I took action by doing more Zora-centric podcast episodes, which translated to another 40-50% more downloads on podcast content.” In effect, NFTs enabled Levy to meet his users where they were once they took the first step of minting an episode. As opposed to sending generic mass emails, Levy’s strategy enables the tailored outreach to podcast audiences who were active Lens or Farcaster users, directly in their social media DMs, or Coinbase Wallet users through the XMTP messaging protocol. It also allows podcasters to curate their podcast content or sponsorships around trending content being minted in real time. Picture having the hard evidence that 80% of your dedicated podcast audience interacted with a certain DeFi or NFT contract in the last six hours. Then imagine pushing out a podcast episode or marketing message crafted around that very topic in the very next hour. It’s a plethora of onchain information that would not have been possible for any traditional podcaster using Spotify or Apple Music, Levy said. “I don’t really care about my reach on Twitter or my audience on Instagram any longer — I care more about the wallets that collect my content because now I have ways to engage them in a permissionless manner where I can never be shadowbanned across any platform.” Aside from podcasting, NFTs have also been used to fight counterfeit and fraud in the luxury goods sector. Since 2021, the Geneva-based non-profit Aura consortium gives luxury brands a way to offer consumers an easy way to trace a product’s lifecycle and authenticate products onchain with NFTs. It’s a purely non-speculative use case applying the immutable properties of NFTs to combat hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fraud and counterfeit in a $300 billion dollar industry. Aura has brought onchain more than50 millionluxury goods from luxury watches, suitcases, shoes, cars, jewelry and furniture for over 50 luxury brands from the likes of Cartier, Dior, Prada, Mercedes-Benz and more. Brands pay Aura licensing fees to use either a private or public blockchain option, though 90% opt for the former for data security and privacy reasons. Traceability represents one of the big challenges in the luxury industry, in part due to laws like the EU’s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation(ESPR)and France’s Anti-Waste for a Circular Economy(AGEC)that put more scrutiny on a product’s lifecycle, Romain Carrere, CEO of Aura Blockchain Consortium told Blockworks. There are countless other cases of NFTs being used for productive purposes, like unlocking new revenue streams for adult creators byMintStars, or raising funds and codifying intellectual property for niche science projects by Bio, as I’vewritten previously.

    "news_content": " But the sector’s rise in popularity hasn’t come without hiccups Santijago/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions,subscribe. Are we really about to see the takeoff of GameFi? It might beslightlytoo early to tell — though I hosted an hour-long X Spaces the other week that ended up primarily focusing on gaming — but I gotta say it looks far more promising this cycle when compared to the last time around. We’vepreviously written about Off the Grid, but I want to zoom out and look at GameFi as a whole. Right now, the sector is facing a “pivotal phase of expansion,” according to areportfrom Nansen and Slice Analytics. I caught up with Slice co-founder Tim Conrad on gaming, given the attention bump it received from not only Off the Grid butannouncementsfrom huge players like Ubisoft, which are angling for exposure through their own releases. Newsletter Subscribe to Empire Newsletter  Although, the recent shift in popularity hasn’t come without its hurdles. “So last cycle, you had the hype phase of the curve, and nobody had enough time to invest the money and time to build a really good game. I think Axie infinity was probably well above its time, and that’s probably why it drew so much attention,” Conrad said. “But it still really lacked that AAA kind of gameplay and experience there … I think that that [the bear market] was the best thing that could have ever happened in the GameFi space. It allowed these triple-A games … to spend that time building, and now we’re seeing the fruits of those labors. And I think it’s drawing a lot of attention.” Areportfrom Grand View Research estimates that the sector could hit $301 billion by 2030. Conrad explained that the figure may not be that far off. He said it’s “basically” based on the  “acceleration that we’re seeing from 2021 and the kind of investment that we’re seeing, in addition to the teams joining, the amount of games that are launching — all that combined, looking into a projected outcome.” It all depends on a few things, including communities. “I think that’s really important to build that community, especially with gaming,” Conrad told me. “We’re seeing the Epic Game store start working with Web3, this is all fantastic. One thing we took a closer look at is what type of community all these games are really growing. And one of the biggest challenges [was] when a new game that hasn’t even launched yet has like a million followers on [X]. It’s a little suspicious, and it makes you realize that a lot of these metrics really need to be scrutinized further,” he explained. “Metrics can be changed like that, but we have to do our best to kind of filter through that noise and really evaluate what is a real metric, and what is something that we shouldn’t put so much weight into.” Now as to what metrics matter the most, well, that might all be figured out once there’s a bit more maturity in the space.

    "news_title": "Solana mobile app launch season is upon us - Blockworks",
    "news_content": " Cube CEO Bartosz Lipinski agreed in a text that having a mobile app is likely to become table stakes for Solana projects sdx15/Shutterstock modified Blockworks This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions,subscribe. A month ago, Solana Mobile announced that the Solana Seeker would ship in mid-2025. This will mark the second iteration of the Solana phone experiment. Partly driven by speculation that the phone will come with lucrative token airdrops, Seeker has seen good early returns. The phone has garnered 145,000 pre-orders, Solana Mobile general manager Emmett Hollyer confirmed to me. What has slipped a bit below the radar is how Solana’s broader app ecosystem is also quietly shifting into mobile. The Solana DeFi giant Jupiter justdebuted its mobile swap platform, and Solana-native apps DRiP, Birdeye, and Cube Exchange also have mobile versions in the works. As crypto attempts to enter a long-awaited era of usable apps, it seems like Solana is having a definitive moment where just about everyone is trying to build a mobile app, or at least thinking about it. Newsletter Subscribe to Lightspeed Newsletter  Bartosz Lipinski, the CEO of Cube, agreed in a text that having a mobile app is likely to become table stakes for Solana projects. If blockchain technology is going to become approachable, it needs to “meet users where they are — on their phones,” Lipinski said. This is all well and good in theory, but the crypto world has known about the need for mobile adoptionfor a long time. Right now, Solana is on the cusp of having a bunch of apps be released into the wild. DRiP is expected in December, a spokesperson said. Cube’s Telegram app is expected next week, and its iOS app is coming in November. Birdeye’s app is expected soon. Once these Solana apps are actually out, the question will become whether they can gain any sort of broad adoption. In at least some cases, builders are thinking that adoption may come from one of crypto’s few mobile success stories to date — Telegram. Cube is releasing a version of its app on Telegram because of the ability to avoid app store approval hurdles and Telegram’s native crypto integration and crypto-native user base, Lipinski told me. Caitlin Cook, the director of growth at Solana-based mobile app Moonwalk Fitness, said Telegram is good for quick access and more lightweight features, but it also has limitations. “[If] your product requires deep functionality, a custom brand experience, and more scalability, building a native app for the app store is probs a better strategy,” Cook said in a direct message. Regardless, Solana mobile app launches are actually here — not just vaguely in the future. The reason behind this seems to at least partly be the continued development of Solana Mobile which, with its grand ambitions and backing from Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, is leading the way in making crypto on mobile less of a talking point and more of a reality.

    "news_title": "Permissionless III dispatch: What a difference a year makes for Solana - Blockworks",
    "news_content": " A blockchain some thought dead in the water two years ago now feels cool DRiP founder Vibhu Norby | Permissionless III by Mike Lawrence Crypto conference panel titles are like little time capsules that give a sense of what the crypto world was interested in at a certain moment in time (at least in the eyes of conference organizers). So here’s one telling example I found: A year ago at Permissionless II, a host of Solana founders sat on a panel called “Solana DeFi: A Phoenix Rises from the Ashes.” This year, the main stage saw a talk called “DeFi: A Phoenix Rises from the Ashes,” but the panel was populated with Ethereum DeFi founders instead. During that 2023 panel, SOL was trading at around $18. Today, it’s around $140. This week, the fees and tips beingprocessedby the Solana blockchain are roughly 70 times what they were during the last Permissionless. Read more:Politics and memecoins drive the conversation on day 2 of Permissionless Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  In brief, it appears that the phoenix has risen from the ashes. This year’s Permissionless conference fell less than a month after Solana’s flagship conference in Singapore, so it was a light week as far as bombshellSolanaannouncements went. Instead, the Solana content was a bit of a heady brew. Read more:These 3 questions remain after Solana Breakpoint Eugene Chen from Ellipsis Labssaidthat “fighting [maximal extractible value] is almost like fighting gravity” due to the inevitable economic force to pack blocks tightly. DRiP’s Vibhu Norby said that memecoins can be better thought of as commerce than as investment during a live taping of the Lightspeed podcast. And someone I chatted with near the coffee station said decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) projects where the infrastructure’s supply comes from the same place as its demand are the most likely to succeed (think of a shared computing network where users offer and also use computing power, as an easy example). As attendees chugged water and generously applied chapstick to battle the Salt Lake City dryness, it became clear to me that Solana has become, for lack of a better word, cool. The Solana breakout track was reasonably full, and a Solana Foundation-sponsored founder summit had to turn around its fair share of curious interlopers. For Solana founders I heard from, the plaudits feel good, especially given how some in crypto tabbed Solana a lost cause following FTX’s unraveling. But it’s also uncharted territory for Solana, which has always felt like a contrarian bet against the much-larger Ethereum. Today, Solana ismuch closer to Ethereumin key usage metrics, and professional investors seem to betaking a liking to SOL. The question I was struck by during the conference is how Solana can adjust to a world where it’s not quite the contrarian underdog anymore. What if new chains come to fruition that are faster, cheaper, more impious to crypto’s high priests? Crypto fans tend to not be fans of social consensus, and being more of a consensus blockchain could prove to be disadvantageous. Solana has certainly risen from the ashes over the past year. It’s now a question of whether the phoenix can also fly. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.

    "news_title": "Politics and memecoins drive the conversation on day 2 of Permissionless - Blockworks",
    "news_content": " When Permissionless III wraps on Friday, there will be 26 days left until the 2024 presidential election Permissionless III by Mike Lawrence for Blockworks The mix of retail and institutional, DeFi and TradFi, suits and T-shirts has been a staple at Permissionless since the inaugural event in 2022. Crypto influencers and US senators find themselves under the same roof this year for three days in Utah. But the circumstances this year are special. When Permissionless III wraps on Friday, there will be 26 days left until the 2024 presidential election. This reality has crept into almost every discussion, both on stage and on the expo floor. “I think it is bullish if Trump wins, and it’s probably negative for a little bit if [Harris] wins,” Dan Tapiero, founder of 1Roundtable Partners and 10T Holdings, said during a Thursday panel discussion. “But the reality is that this move toward putting all value on a blockchain is bigger than one election.” Read more:Axe throws and crypto wizards: Permissionless III is underway The comments contrast a widely accepted narrative from many industry players — and certain politicians — that a second Donald Trump presidency will lead to a more friendly environment for crypto in the US. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  “He’s evolved on this issue to the point where he’s going to advocate for it,” House Majority WhipTom Emmer told Blockworksof Trump’s crypto stance and the about-face he’s done in recent months. “[Harris] doesn’t know what she’s talking about,” he added. Couple the looming election with increasingly uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a crypto market that just can’t seem to take off again, and you paint a somewhat bleak picture. Still, the speakers in Salt Lake City managed to bring some levity to the situation: Focus on the memes. “I don’t want to wax too philosophical here, but partially because the transparency of mobile phones, trust in US institutions has really gone down,”VanEckCEO Jan van Eck said on stage. “Trust in Congress, trust in academia, trust in mainstream media has basically disappeared,” van Eck added. “The fact that some of the memecoins make fun of some of that, I think, is great. It’s a joyful response, a social response.” Read more from our opinion section:Political candidates can no longer ignore crypto voters Aside from politics and memecoins, it just wouldn’t be a crypto conference if people didn’t talk about price action. Even as bitcoin dipped below $59,000 Thursday, the bulls were unphased. Tapiero said he expects BTC to hit between $150,000 and $180,000 in two years or so. Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead threw out a number too: $117,000 by August 2025.Van Eck didn’t share a specific price expectation, but added with a smile: “I think we’re all bulls on this stage.” Ben Strack contributed reporting.

    "news_title": "Axe throws and crypto wizards: Permissionless III is underway - Blockworks",
    "news_content": " Permissionless provokes thoughts on the future of crypto as folks engage in pull-up competitions Permissionless III Photo by Mike Lawrence for Blockworks Wizards on stage. Rock climbing. And don’t forget the axe throwing. These things and more helped set the tone during Permissionless III’s first day as thousands of crypto denizens descended on Salt Lake City. There’s excitement in the air as folks sit in on sessions focused on a variety of topics, from investing in private markets to a fireside chat with BlackRock’s Samara Cohen (we’ll get to that in a bit). One attendee remarked that they preferred Permissionless over other popular crypto events, remarking that it was “less of a zoo.” While many attendees noted that the overall vibes were good, Ram Ahluwalia told me that he felt the vibes were “malaise.” For Ahluwalia, one question lingered above his head like a rainy cloud: Will the latecomers — who bought in as prices rose — HODL or dip once we carve out a new all-time high? Blockworks Chief Operating Officer Sid Viswanath noted he’d received a lot of positive feedback from attendees, with some even remarking that they prefer the quality of the event, which is smaller than last year. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  As for the main stage, a16z crypto’s Chris Dixon was one of the first folks to speak at the conference on Wednesday. Dixon, appearing on the main stage, pushed for bipartisan legislation, noting that there’s a current “chill” on crypto due to the overall environment. The regulatory environment — which has become one of the most popular topics for crypto — was mentioned heavily throughout many of the panels, especially the ones that took place on the main stage. But there’s an undertone of bullishness rippling through the attendees and the speakers at this year’s event. And I’m not just writing that as a Blockworks staffer. Read more from our opinion section:Political candidates can no longer ignore crypto voters BlackRock’s Samara Cohen gave some insight into IBIT’s investors and the appetite that the world’s largest asset manager has seen since launching its bitcoin ETF in January of this year. Cohen said that roughly 75% of buyers of IBIT were first-time iShare buyers, showing that the majority of the investors were crypto natives. Looking at 13F filings, she noted roughly 85% of the investors were direct buyers. “What we have actually seen is an appetite” forbitcoin ETFs, Cohen said. After her talk, one attendee commented that Cohen was “badass.” Off the main stage, attendees filled up the so-called breakout tracks, or smaller panels, which began in the afternoon. In one such panel, a wizard — Taproots Wizard co-founder Eric Wall — sat next to Galaxy’s Alex Thorn as the two discussed bitcoin with Bankless co-founder David Hoffman. Hoffman will not only take the stage at Permissionless but will also be in the ring on Friday to take on Kain Warwick in a Karate Combat match.

    "news_title": "Token2049: A circus of crypto and commerce - Blockworks",
    "news_content": " Plus, fun and games at Solana Breakpoint and crypto meets F1 Richie Chan/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks If I should describe Token2049 in a word, it would be “extravagance.” Walking along the conference halls of Marina Bay Sands, one is bombarded by several DJs spinning at the same time, audaciously-dressed women from traditional marketing agencies shoving flyers at attendees and the occasional absurdly-costumed mascot you can’t help but stare at. Token2049 Singapore is arguably the crypto industry’s largest business-driven event, and its ostentatious presentation leaves no room for moderation. Step into the exhibition areas and you’re greeted by a plethora of circus-like entertainment options between booths: retro arcade gaming machines, punching bags, a Spanish-style bullfighting ring and even an 18-foot rock climbing wall. You’d be forgiven for almost forgetting you were here for work. Stepping out for a breather? There’s even a Bitvavo-sponsored massage room, but expect at least a 30-minute wait (I, sadly, had to pass). One major crypto company told me that the glitz and glamor was all a bit too “excessive,” and it’s hard to disagree. Based on the official Token2049 site, the event was being attended by at least 7000 companies and 20,000 attendees — numbers that exceed the daily active users of even L1/L2 chains. With nearly 800 side events — and that’s not counting the probably hundreds more private events — it’s a stark contrast to the more sober and low-key developer-focused crypto events of the west. I recall a prominent running gag from previous Token2049s that pointed out how the conference was overrun by venture and hedge funds, while suffering from a dearth of builders. The same could definitely not be said for the vibe this year. DeFi-centric builders like Aave, Uniswap, Matcha, Sky (previously Maker), EigenLayer, Ethena and Ether.Fi populated the conference and side events this year. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  Brand names I expected to see more of — like Cosmos and Cardano — had a relatively muted presence, though I did spot a jubilant Charles Hoskinson being trailed by his entourage. Notably missing in conference action, and the side events too, were the horde of GameFi and NFT projects that dominated past Token2049s. “Conferences like ETH Denver or Devcon are tech-focused, as opposed to Token2049 which is more commercial,” Synthetix and Infinex co-founder Kain Warwick told me. Read more:ETHDenver showed good vibes are back in crypto, but questions remain “The nice thing about Token2049 this year is you have both the cracked-out zk engineers running around, but you also have tons of VCs and TradFi companies. It’s a really good mix, and more representative of the whole industry rather than just siloing off tech or commercial alone,” Warwick said. But to call it “Token2049 week” would be a misnomer. Right after Token2049 was also of course Solana’s flagship annual event, Breakpoint. In terms of event size and attendance, Breakpoint was but a mere fraction of Token2049. But what it lacked in opulence, Breakpoint made up for in a highly engaged and application-focused conference. Perhaps the biggest announcement came from Jump Trading’s chief scientist Kevin Bowers, who announcedFiredancer, the long-awaited Solana validator client poised to solve most of the L1’s existing problems. The Solana team also unveiled a new“Solana Seeker” Web3 phone, together with the Play Solana Gen1 (PSG1), a new Web3 gamingdevicethat resembles the nostalgic Nintendo Game Boy of the past. In Solana DeFi news, the liquid staking platformMarinadeannounced its v2 platform, Jupiter Exchange acquired Cosmos DEX aggregatorCoinhalland theSolanaFMblock explorer, and both Sky (previously Maker) and Coinbase are bringing their respective USDS stablecoin and tokenized bitcoin cbBTC to Solana. Also, Zeta Markets announced Solana’s first layer-2 solution Bullet, and Iggy Azalea is launching “Motherland,” an online gaming casino for her MOTHER memecoin. Coming to Solana on the TradFi side of things,Franklin Templetonannounced plans for a money market fund, the tokenization platformSecuritizeis partnering with Wormhole to integrate its tokenized assets from EVM chains and French bankSociete Generaleis taking its EURCV euro-pegged stablecoin to Solana. Straddling Token2049 and Breakpoint was also a slew of other events, includingEthereum Singapore, Balaji Srinivasan’s Network State conference and the F1 Singapore Grand Prix event that brought most roads in Singapore’s central business district to a close. Down in the F1 pits, McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown, drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri and OKX Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique unveiled their new “Legend Reborn” MCL38 car, co-designed with OKX. That very car was piloted by Norris and Piastri to first and third place, respectively, at the Singapore Grand Prix. The joint partnership of OKX and McLaren is a union of two heritage brands, Rafique told me amid a throng of screaming teen fans and the occasional high-pitch screech of cars zipping by. “OKXhas been around longer than Coinbase, Binance or Bybit, and we wanted people to learn what OKX stands for, which is resilience. We looked for a partner that could match that resilience, and that’s why we chose McLaren.” As the week of Token2049 comes to a close, one thing has become clear to me: Token2049 is not a “crypto conference.” Rather, it’s more accurately a conference dedicated to the intersection of the blockchain and traditional industries. Many of the booth names at Token2049 would be foreign to most crypto-natives. With thousands of companies attending, that is somewhat to be expected. “There’s a strong [business developer] focus,” Aave founder Stani Kulechov told me. “What’s interesting about Token2049 is it’s in Singapore, which really connects all parts of the world, so you have a lot of people coming from Europe, the US and APAC, which makes it really unique.” Yet, with full-day summits and side events for every niche sector of crypto you could possibly think of — including DePIN, crypto & AI, DeSci (decentralized science), market making and more — there was truly something for everyone.

    "news_title": "Web3 Watch: Solana announces second ‘Web3 phone’ - Blockworks",
    "news_content": " Plus, Puma’s latest venture into Web3 sdx15/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Over a year after debuting its first so-called “Web3 phone,” Solana unveiled new details about its second attempt at a DeFi-friendly smartphone: the Solana Seeker. Initial reviews of Saga were mixed in 2023, with users complaining about thevarietyof dapps available and many ultimately deciding the crypto features werenot enoughto convince them to ditch their standard smartphone. TheSeeker, previously referred to as “Chapter 2,” will come with updated versions of the Seed Vault Wallet and Solana dapp Store. The phone will launch in 2025. Read more:Solana’s second phone is nearly here — and so are the airdrops Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  Demand for the Saga device surged earlier this year when owners were airdropped an exclusive “Saga Monkes” NFT, which quickly became more valuable than the phone itself. In early January, the NFTs were listed for around $1,250, more than double the price of the smartphone at the time. At time of publication, thefloor pricefor Saga Monkes was 1.68 SOL, or around $240. The Seeker experienced a similar phenomenon. Those who preordered the device were airdropped two memecoins that briefly surged in price and covered the value of the not-yet-launched phone. German sports brand Puma haspartneredwith mobile game UNKJD Soccer to bring its brand into the virtual universe. “Placing the Puma brand and products in digital environments is critical to our success and there is no more natural fit than UNKJD Soccer,” Ivan Dashkov, director of emerging market technology at Puma, said in a statement Thursday. “People are increasingly expressing themselves in games and digital worlds, so having the Puma brand available in these environments is a huge priority to us asgamingculture is a part of our all-encompassing culture.” Read more:Web3 Watch: Reebok jumps into digital wearable game The collaboration is the latest of many that Puma has with various Web3 brands. Puma in 2022 announced it was joining forces with 10KTF to offer NFT PFPs. Web3 security platform CertiK’s new venture capital business plans to invest $45 million in a new suite of products, both in-house and from outside companies. The investment will in part go to funding two free-to-use security tools: Token Scan and Wallet Scan, the company announced during the Token2049 conference in Singapore.

    "news_content": " Plus, Osmosis goes cross-chain with Polaris DEX-aggregator friend.tech and Adobe stock modified by Blockworks The SocialFi network friend.tech has taken a significant step this week, and appears to have abandoned further development of its once-popular platform. On Monday, friend.techannouncedit was transferring the administrative and ownership rights of the platform’s code to a null address. This effectively makes any future changes to fee rates or functionalities impossible. Though friend.tech will continue to exist on the Base blockchain, this move is being interpreted bycommunity memberson X as a lack of desire to continue maintaining the project. The SocialFi platform first launched on Aug. 10, 2023. It subsequently undertook an unprecedented 100% community allocation of FRIEND tokens to users in May 2024, in contrast to most projects where a certain percentage of tokens are set aside for early investors. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  Post-airdrop, FRIEND reached a peak of $2.86 but has since cratered to $0.09. Even with the introduction of new features in a v2 update, including social clubs, the platform has struggled to revive trading volumes, whichreachedmulti-million dollarfigures last September. Friend.techhas generated about $22.3 million in protocol fees, according toDune. Osmosis DEXunveiledits latest product on Wednesday: Polaris, a cross-chain DEX aggregator. Polaris wants to address the persistent problem of liquidity fragmentation — or the “Great Chain Divide” as Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal calls it – by letting users trade any asset from any chain with their existing wallets. Unlike liquidity aggregators, Polaris simplifies cross-chain trading by offering a streamlined interface powered by multiparty computation (MPC) technology. This interfacehandlescomplex processes like token conversion, bridging, approvals and gas token acquisition — all from users’ existing wallets. “Osmosis is the foundation” and “our mission is to build the Interchain DEX,” Aggarwaltweeted. This move marks a notable change in Osmosis’ longstanding strategic focus within the Cosmos ecosystem. The product will be officially revealed next week at Solana Breakpoint 2024 in Singapore.

    "news_content": " The new Snapshot X protocol uses storage proofs to enable voting without needing to bridge Snapshot and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks Governance voting platform Snapshot has announced thelaunchof Snapshot X, a new onchain voting protocol. The new protocol will be launched on the layer-2 network Starknet and leverage the technology of “storage proofs” fromHerodotus, a middleware blockchain infrastructure company. Snapshot said in the announcement that96%of DAOs use its platform for offchain voting. By voting off-chain, token holders can skirt the high gas fees of the Ethereum layer-1 while signaling their early positions on key governance issues. However, votes are typically considered finalized only after an onchain vote is concluded with a separate voting platform like Tally. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  In an effort to bring DAO voting onchain cheaply, the new Snapshot protocol will leverage storage proofs to verify token holdership on Ethereum layer-1 before enabling votes onchain from Starknet. Read more:DAO behind Mango Markets votes for SEC settlement Thanks to Starknet’s support of native Ethereum cryptographic signatures, Snapshot X abstracts the use of the zk-powered layer-2 on the backend. This enables the use of popular EVM wallets like MetaMask on Snapshot X without requiring users to separately onboard to Starknet. Like the original Snapshot protocol, Snapshot X will also be programmable and allow for differentgovernancecoordination mechanisms. These include the various features that DAOs have historically used in governance like NFT voting, gasless signature voting, permissioned/whitelisted proposal creation and time-locked execution. “Essentially, the point of Snapshot X is unstoppable onchain governance,” Snapshot Labs Chief Operating Officer Jeremy Musighi told Blockworks. Snapshot Labs first raised $4 million in November 2021 in a round led by 1kx venture fund. Updated September 10, 2024 at 12:19 pm ET: Clarified Snapshot’s announcement.

    "news_content": " Meanwhile, Euler returns with a V2 launch of its lending protocol EigenLayer and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks EigenLayer plans todistribute86 million EIGEN tokens, around 5.1% of its total supply, as part of its Season 2 “stakedrop” campaign. The distribution will be split across three groups: The airdrop is based on a snapshot taken on Aug. 15, 2024, with claims opening on Sept. 17, 2024. The DeFi lending protocol Euler launched its V2 deployment on Wednesday. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  Unlike V1, Euler V2 is being reimagined with a fundamentally modular design that “isolates risk, is easier to test, analyze, and audit, and reduces single points of failure,” according to an officialblog post. With the aid of the protocol’s “Euler Vault Kit”, builders can create ERC4626 vaults that are customizable in terms of risk management, governance settings, and asset collateral types. These vaults can be interconnected using the “Ethereum Vault Connector” module, allowing deposits to be recognized across different vaults seamlessly. Euler V2’s modular design allows vaults to interact, enabling diverse credit markets tailored to specific needs. This flexibility supports various lending strategies and asset management approaches, leading the team to brand it as a “meta-lending” protocol capable of unifying multiple lending and borrowing markets. Back in March 2023, Euler was exploited in a $197 million flash loan attack. Following negotiations and pressure from the community and law enforcement, the attacker ultimatelyreturnedthe stolen funds. In response, Euler V2 underwent a rigorous security process, with 29 audits conducted by 12 independent firms. The team has described this as “one of the most expensive and comprehensive security processes for any DeFi protocol to date,” according to their official blog.

    "news_content": " Plus, ZKsync welcomes a social gaming ecosystem with 20M monthly active users Klochkov SCS/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks The consumer electronics giant Sonyintroducedits own Ethereum L2, dubbed Soneium, on Friday. Testnet deployment is set to go live in the coming weeks. The announcement was well received amid the crypto market’s increasinglamentationof infrastructural bloat and lack of consumer applications. The details around actual onchain use-cases are still vague, but Sony’s focus seems to be centered around creators. The official Soneium blogemphasized“protection of rights to creativity created by creators”, and “new mechanisms for returning profits to support creators and fans.” Sony intends to build Soneium with Optimism’s rollup development kit “OP Stack”, which already boasts 29 L2 chains in its Superchain ecosystem, based onL2Beat. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  The company will launch the L2 chain under Sony Block Solutions Labs. This is a joint venture between Sony Group Corporation and Startale, a Singapore-based blockchain infrastructure startup that raised $3.5 million in June 2023. Startale helped develop the Astar Network zkEVM chain, which is planned to transition to Soneium. As Optimism expands its burgeoning ecosystem of Superchains, ZKsync isn’t asleep at the wheel either.Steppinginto the ZKsync Elastic Chain ecosystem this week is CREATOR chain, a project originally incubated by ZTX (ZepetoX). ZTX is the metaverse initiative of ZEPETO, an Asia-based avatar social game with 20 million monthly active users. It’s another bold attempt at leveraging a successful Web2 distribution funnel of users into Web3. “CREATOR will offer personalized DeFi services for creators and position itself as the premier Web 2.5 hub and a one-stop shop for new entrants to crypto,” the official press release said. ZTX’s open beta has been live on Arbitrum since December 2023. It is migrating to take advantage of ZKsync’s zero-knowledge technology stack. Marco Cora, Director at the ZKsync Foundation, said: “With ZKsync, ZTX can keep up with their explosive scaling needs while also avoiding the fee spikes commonly seen in other stacks during demand surges.” Blast L2 transactions are hitting all-time highs in the last week, racing up to almost 2.5 million in transaction count. It’s currently the second most used L2 behind Base, based onGrowthepiedata. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.

The flight is being pulled off with Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and the Space Exploration and Research Agency (SERA), an organization focused on broadening access to space research and exploration. SERA secured six seats on Blue Origin’s upcoming New Shepard flight, and Base users can sign up to be considered for the flight by minting from a set of NFTs on Base. The final crew is voted on by the SERA community. In collaboration with Base, SERA released an NFT triptych that can be purchased one by one for around $3 — roughly the same price other astronaut candidates havepaid. Users who collect all three NFTs are fast-tracked into the second round of the astronaut selection process. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  Read more:A bitcoin headed for the moon may be lost in space Base’s onchain summer has broadly looked to bring users to Base through games, NFTs, and giveaways, among other things. It’s a gamified attempt to draw users that, perhaps refreshingly, doesn’t involve a native token airdrop. Over the past 90 days, Base has seen roughly 280 million transactions, according to L2 Beat, which is the most of any layer-2 by a wide margin. Read more:Airdrop backscratching is crypto’s latest dilemma Following the announcement, Base users chimed in on social media with their typical rallying cry: “Based.” The encrypted messaging app Telegram — nearly ubiquitous among Web3’s faithful — announced further updates to its in-app Stars currency.

Stars live off chain but can be converted to the Toncoin cryptocurrency for nearly no commission, Telegramsaid. Read more:Web3 Watch: Telegram launches browser, ‘mini app store’ Telegram creators can also create exclusive channels where subscribers pay a monthly amount of Stars for access.

Telegram’s browser gives users more streamlined access to the mini apps, such as “Hamster Combat” and “Catizen,” which have captured users’ attention in recent weeks following the TON-based airdrop carried out by the “Notcoin” tap-to-earn game. Read more:Telegram tap-to-earn is the new crypto gaming trend TelegramCEO Pavel Durov first announced the new features on July 19. Three days later, he announced the app had reached 950 million active users (although it’s unclear how this figure was calculated. And with the airdrop fever surrounding TON mini-apps, it’s fair to assume that at least some of these users are duplicates). Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  The mini app store and browser are linked, with the app store redirecting users to mini app sites on the browser. Users can have several “tabs” open at once. Read more:Lightspeed Newsletter: Solana transactions can now happen directly within X As part of the same update, Telegram enabled users to gift stars — an in-app currency that can be exchanged for TON tokens — to their friends, who can then use the stars for in-app purchases on Telegram. Telegram has long been the go-to messaging app for crypto-natives. Durov and Co. — who have long been associated with Web3 — appear to be in the process of formalizing that connection. 6th Man Ventures’ Mike Dudaswroteon X that Telegram is “by far the most crypto-friendly global social platform” following the announcement. The sports betting platform DraftKings became the latest US-based company to cease itsNFTactivities, vaguelyciting“recent legal developments” in a website pop-up announcing the shuttering. DraftKings had formerly offered NFTs as part of Reignmakers, a fantasy sports game that let users acquire digital collectibles of NFL, UFC and PGA Tour athletes. In the game, users would build lineups with NFTs to try earning rewards including cash and digital packs of cards. DraftKings’ move is the latest in a growing trend of NFT initiatives shutting down, following similar moves fromMeta,X,GameStop, andStarbucks.

    "news_title": "In Nashville, Bitcoiners and American politics collide - Blockworks",
    "news_content": " It wasn’t a Trump rally, organizers insisted. Attendees may not have gotten the memo though. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. | lev radin/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks Former President Donald Trump’s keynote address at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville over the weekend wasn’t a campaign rally, organizers said, but judging by the line to take photos with his cardboard cutout, attendees begged to differ. Twenty thousand ticket holders and an additional 15,000 onlookers flocked to Nashville last week for the Bitcoin 2024 conference, organizers claim. Other politicians, some more embraced by the bitcoin community than others, had their time on the main stage as well: Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., and Tim Scott, R-S.C., plus Democrat Rep. Wiley Nickel of North Carolina. Read more:On the Margin Newsletter: Trump’s crypto ‘promises’ at Bitcoin 2024 Current and former presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Vivek Ramaswamy also made the rounds. Paraphernalia declaring “Make America Great Again’” — and the arguably more popular “Make Bitcoin Great Again” — was a dime a dozen inside Music City Center. So was swag depicting Ross Ulbricht, who is currentlyserving a double life sentencefor creating and operating the darknet siteSilk Road. I made eye contact with a woman wearing a “Free Ross. Vote Trump.” T-shirt in the mirror of the ladies’ room ahead ofTrump’s keynoteon Saturday. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  “Couldn’t he have pardoned Ross when he was president?” I asked, glancing at her shirt. She glanced at the press badge hanging from my neck. “No. Too political.” She was already walking away before I could follow up. Ulbricht, convicted in 2015 on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy, may now just be political enough.Trumpin May pledged to commute Ulbricht’s sentence, along with a slew of other pardons he plans to make should he win in November. He repeated the promise again during his keynote address on Saturday, adding that he stood with any bitcoiners who have had their assets unjustly seized. “As you know, most of the bitcoin currently held by the United States government was obtained through law enforcement action,” Trump said. “You know that they took it from you. Let’s take that guy’s life. Let’s take his family. His house. His bitcoin.” Read more:US government dumps bitcoin stolen from Silk Road, $1.2B to go The crowd cheered. Ulbricht was a major theme of the weekend. A booth frequently manned by Ulbricht’s mother, Lyn, passed out free T-shirts. Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey hassaidthat Vice President Kamala Harris should vow to commute Ulbricht’s sentence before engaging with the bitcoin community. The crowd throughout the weekend skewed young, with many minors tagging (or being dragged) along with their parents. A baby, just 14 weeks old, sat in the front row during Trump’s speech, donning a MAGA onesie and headphones. The outing was made difficult by the venue’s no-bag policy, the mother told me, which extended to strollers. But she had no regrets. Another attendee told me he opted to leave his two-and-a-half-year-old at home, saying the security and crowd were “too much,” although his child has already been to 16 conferences. Several young blond children ran around the Nashville Municipal Auditorium on Thursday night where conference attendees gathered for a karate combat fight. I was told they wereKennedy’s grandchildren. The independent presidential candidate was inside, posing for selfies and commentating on the action in the ring. Despite bitcoin’s relatively quiet price action in recent weeks, the mood was, generally speaking, positive. Most side events featured passed hors d’oeuvres and buffets — companies shelling out is a true bull market signal. As one man made his way over to a saved seat toward the front of the room for Trump’s speech, I overheard him bragging to his friends. A woman the night before had agreed to leave the bar with him “without even seeing the Lambo.” After all, what would a bitcoin conference be without the mention of a Lamborghini?

In an X post, Founders Fund partner Joey Krug said the firm was drawn to Pudgy Penguins and its newlayer-2vision partly because of its ability to acquire customers while making money through its in-store sales for NFT-based toys. “[W]henever someone buys a pudgy penguin in stores like @Walmart and @Target, @IglooInc actually makes money on those sales, and it’s basically a way to not only […] pay for users, but actually acquire users profitably, which is extremely novel within crypto,” Krugwrote.

In May of 2023 we secured a $12 million dollar investment led by 10T Holdings with participation from Framework Ventures and Santiago Santos. Our newsroom is completely independent. Our co-founders, owners and investors do not have input or visibility into what we choose to cover, when we cover it, or how we report on any story. Blockworks has achieved a perfect score fromNewsGuard, an independent tool that rates media properties against nine criteria for transparency and credibility. If you wish to discuss stories, tips, or your perspectives with Blockworks, or if we reach out to discuss these things with you, you should know that there are some journalistic standards that remain consistent. These include how and when we may identify you, and whether your communications with us are confidential or if they can be used in our reporting. You should also know that all Blockworks reporters and editors will clearly identify themselves as such before any information is considered eligible for publication. Our conversations, email threads, direct messages with you… in fact all communications with Blockworks areby defaultOn The Record. This means that we may choose to report what you say in those communications, and we may choose to identify you. Don’t worry – there are alternatives! If you ask us in advance to keep our conversations confidential, we may agree to do so. When we make that agreement, we keep it. Once we have agreed to be off the record, we are no longer allowed to use this information in our reporting. However, we do not simply agree to off the record communications without question. We don’t grant the ability to speak off the recordretroactively, for instance. Think of it as a contract: If we sign up, we’re bound to its terms. If we don’t… then no deal. We will also generally ask why the communication needs to be confidential. And we may follow-up with other sources to find someone who has the same information but who is willing to speak on the record or on background. Either way, if we agree that we’re off the record, it’s a promise. (For further information on the protection of journalists’ confidential information and sources in the United States,here’s a resourcethat goes much deeper.) On background means that we will not identify you personally by name or job title but that we may use your words or the information you share with us in our reporting, and we may attribute that information to “a spokesperson” or “a company representative” or similar. This is another agreement that must be made in advance. Specifically note that you want to share information on background before you share it, and remember that any Blockworks reporter or editor has to actually indicate that we’re a party to this agreement. Again: Ask first! Seek permission, not forgiveness! Blockworks may report on stories which have been sourced partly, or entirely, on background — or colloquially, through ‘anonymous sources’. When such sources are the primary sources for any article, their inclusion will require that the editor-in-chief approves their use. In so doing, the editor-in-chief will require that the reporter disclose why the source needs to remain anonymous, and how proximate the source is to the information itself. The reporter will not be asked to divulge the name of a source, nor information that would clearly dox the source, but they may be asked to provide details such as an approximate job title, a date on which a conversation took place, a location, and so on. Any anonymity promised to a source will be likewise respected by the editor-in-chief. While we are committed to protecting the privacy of sources to whom anonymity has been promised, Blockworks will attempt to verify the information they provide with other sources. We will run a story based on one anonymous source only in the most extreme cases, where the public’s need-to-know is taken into account and there is no practicable way to source the information elsewhere. Our rules for working with public relations agencies and departments, and company or DAO communications professionals, are clearly articulated here to prevent misunderstandings. We strongly discourage the submission of embargoed news to Blockworks, and our default setting is that we do not recognize or abide by embargoes unless we agree to do so in advance. Therefore we strongly suggest that communications professionals ask us in advance whether we wish to receive and observe their embargoed news. Embargoes, while commonplace in the crypto media industry, do not always serve us or our readers well. We will agree to an embargo only when there is a clear reason for it to exist. For instance, while sharing information that might materially affect a stock price or equity is a valid reason for an embargo, we do not consider a marketing strategy of releasing news across multiple media outlets to be consistent with our mission to serve our readers with timely and accurate news. Instead of an embargo, we request that communications professionals consider sharing exclusive news with Blockworks if you want us to prepare meaningful articles and solicit further comment and insight in advance of a specific time and date. If we are offered a story exclusively, we take that to mean that you have not shared the information with other media outlets. We may also under certain circumstances consider news that we have the right to publish ahead of other outlets. In all cases, such agreements must be made in writing, and in advance of sharing your news with us. We hope that by articulating these policies and principles clearly, we can work effectively with communications professionals to provide our readers with news that they can trust and that is of value. If your goal is to include Blockworks as part of your marketing strategy, our advertising sales team can be reachedhere. Blockworks editors and reporters are strongly discouraged from opening PDF documents and Word docs due to the risks involved with attachments. We prefer that pitches are sent as in-line emails or as Google docs open for viewing. Finally, communications professionals are not generally afforded the same latitude as the general public when discussing stories, and all conversations and communications with those whose primary job is to communicate with the media will be considered on the record unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing, and in advance. While we strive for accuracy in our work, we are also a hard-working breaking newsroom. We are not perfect. We encourage the subjects of our article and the general public to suggest corrections, clarifications, and updates when they see the need. See the contact details at the bottom of this page. We transparently issue timely updates and clearly indicate the time and nature of such updates at the bottom of our articles. We do not publish update notices for grammatical, spelling, or formatting changes, or for other non-substantive changes. Reporters and editors at Blockworks are committed to avoiding conflicts of interest in their work. While we are not prohibited from covering stories thatmentiona cryptocurrency or equity in which a reporter may be invested, reporters are required to note to their editor that they hold such a position. We are not permitted to write or edit stories on a cryptocurrency or equity in which we are invested if that asset is theprimary subject of an article, which is determined by the editor (or, if the editor holds the position, by the editor-in-chief). We are not permitted to trade any cryptocurrency or equity in which we are investedwithin 72 hours of mentioning or writing about that asset in any capacity, with the exception of stories that may mention or be focused on Bitcoin or Ether (which are essentially the ‘currencies of record’ of the cryptocurrency world, similar to the dollar or pound sterling). If a story requires that a reporter or editor mention an asset they have tradedin the 72 hours before publication, the story will be assigned to another writer or editor. We update our public financial disclosures quarterly. Opinion and news analysis will be clearly labeled as such. Opinions and news analysis do not necessarily represent the views of Blockworks, its principals, its owners, or staff, other than those credited with a byline. Where news analysis appears in the same article as a straight news report, it will be bylined by a different author who will be clearly identified as a news analyst for the piece. Blockworks has a zero tolerance policy regarding plagiarism. Where our reporting is based on other media reports, press releases, written statements, or social media postings, we will clearly identify the source of that information. While we strive to ensure that our social media posts are accurate and factual, they do not live under the same umbrella as our journalism and are often posted by members of the Blockworks team who are not journalists or editors. We kindly ask readers to understand that the same journalistic diligence may not be applied to the quickfire nature of social media posting, though we welcome feedback and corrections in the same manner. Note that our journalists and staff may operate their own social media accounts, and Blockworks has no control over, or input into, what they may post on their own accounts. Our Sponsored Content team is completely separate from our Editorial team. Journalists and Editors at Blockworks do not have input into the commissioning, writing, production, editing, timing, or publication of Sponsored Content in any way. Thanks for your interest, but the Blockworks news page doesn’t engage in content marketing as a rule. We do not post press releases, guest posts (other than op-eds we solicit) or paid individual posts. Blockworks publishes news at the sole discretion of our editorial staff, except for a limited number of sponsored posts clearly marked as such. You can contact[email protected]if you’d like information about packages available. Blockworks does not currently use AI or generative text tools in its journalism. We are experimenting with using imagery created by AI, and we attribute these images accordingly. When (and if) we use AI in any of our writing, we will update this page and note that AI tools have been used in producing any text on our Editorial pages. For the first five years of our existence, we were privately-owned by our two founders (Mike Ippolito and Jason Yanowitz) and we had no ownership connections to cryptocurrency companies, funds, exchanges, or any issuer of cryptocurrency. In May of 2023 we raised a $12 million dollar investment led by 10T Holdings with participation from Framework Ventures and Santiago Santos to help us continue to build our information platform. The Society of Professional Journalists has published aCode of Ethicswhich is the working document from which some of these points have been sourced, and which has inspired other aspects of our Ethics Statement. If you have news tips, suggestions, a request for correction, or any other feedback on our journalism, we encourage you to contact our news desk:[email protected]. If you wish to contact the writer of a story directly, you can find contact information for our staffhere.
