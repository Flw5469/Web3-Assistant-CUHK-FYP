Designed for smart contracts, it supports decentralized finance apps, tokens, and games. Its native coin, ADA, stands alongside Ethereum’s ETH, offering users a way to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. What sets Cardano apart is its eco-friendly proof-of-stake mechanism, which uses far less energy than traditional models. The blockchain’s unique two-layer system boosts its speed and efficiency. The Cardano Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Cardano Computing Layer manages smart contracts. This design could potentially process up to a million transactions per second. With native tokens introduced in March 2021, Cardano offers secure and low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In today’s market, Cardano’s focus on sustainability and scalability positions it as a strong contender among cryptocurrencies, appealing to those seeking efficient and eco-friendly options. While ADA may see gains from Bitcoin’s new peak, the innovative $XYZ memecoin could take center stage with its ambitious growth and sports-focused community.
