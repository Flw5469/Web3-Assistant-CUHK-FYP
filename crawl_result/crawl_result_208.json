    "news_content": "Manish ChhetriFXStreet Cardano (ADA) is trading slightly down around $0.33 on Monday, struggling against resistance from its previously broken ascending trendline. Declining daily trading volume reinforces a bearish outlook, indicating reduced trader interest and liquidity in the ADA chain. Cardano price broke and closed below the ascending trendline (drawn by joining multiple low levels since August ) on Friday, after rejection and declining 9.2% from the 50% price retracement level at $0.367 since Wednesday. It recovered slightly to retest the broken trendline and was rejected. On Monday, it declines slightly, trading around $0.332, facing resistance from the broken trendline at around $0.342. If the $0.342 holds as resistance, ADA could decline over 9% to retest its September 6 low of $0.303. The Relative Strength Index (RSI)  indicator on the daily chart reads 42,  below its neutral level of 50, indicating increasing bearish momentum.  ADA/USDT daily chart Based on IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP), nearly 119,360 addresses accumulated 2.27 billion ADA tokens at an average price of $0.336. These addresses bought the tokens previously for between $0.332 and $0.341 and would likely sell them to get out at a breakeven price, which makes it a key resistance zone. Interestingly, the zone mentioned from a technicalanalysisperspective, the $0.341 level, coincides with the IOMAP findings, making this zone a key reversal area to watch.  Cardano IOMAP chart.

Artemis Terminal data shows that ADA’s daily trading volume fell from $545 million on Friday to $197 million on Sunday, the lowest level since early October and has been constantly declining since mid-February.

This scenario could result in a rise in Cardano’s price to retest its September 27 high of $0.415. Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
