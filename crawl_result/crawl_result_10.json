    "news_title": "The Ideal Web3 Game Must Have Web2-Style Gameplay",
    "news_content": "The slow but sure rise of Web3 has given birth to the concept of “play-to-earn” games that integrate with blockchain to provide players with ownership of their gaming assets and the ability to get paid for doing what they love best. But despite some initial success, notably during the height of the COVID pandemic when some people claimed to be making enough money to pay their living costs simply by playing games, Web3 game titles remain something of a niche product, with very fewrealvideo games players embracing them. You might not be able to make any money playing popular video games like Grand Theft Auto, Ghost Recon and Fortnite, but most players don’t actually care about this. The reason they play games is because they want to have fun, and that appears to be something that Web3 games developers have forgotten about in their rush to bring blockchain gaming to the fore. Games like Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties both enjoyed a comparative degree of success, creating strong communities around their games, making headlines around the world. They were early showcases of how blockchain can be used to create unique digital assets from NFTs. These NFTs represent in-game assets, like characters, skins, weapons and accessories, that players can own and trade freely with one another. Blockchain also supports the creation of tokens, or in-game currencies that players can earn as rewards for winning battles and progressing through the game, enabling them to monetize their time and effort. The idea of getting paid for playing games is intriguing and it was undoubtedly the reason why Axie Infinity became so popular circa 2021, with some players reporting that they could earn hundreds of dollars per week. However, it was also the reason why Axie Infinity failed. Ultimately, the in-game economy proved itself to be unsustainable, as it was reliant on a continual flow of new players entering the game to provide capital for existing players to earn. The gameplay itself was seen asrepetitive and boring, and with the ever-dwindling profits being the only real incentive for people to keep playing, it struggled to keep adding them. When Axie fell by the wayside, a new generation of crypto games emerged that have focused on improving the gameplay and making the experience more enjoyable. Star Atlasbilled itself as the first AAA play-to-earn game, with its awe-inspiring graphics and an enormous gaming universe that one player alone could never hope to explore. As a space-based MMORPG exploration, trading and mining game, Star Atlas aimed to merge blockchain with real-time graphics, immersive gameplay and DeFi-like mechanics. Its stunning visuals were enabled by Unreal Engine 5’s Nanite system, creating an expansive universe of truly alien worlds ripe for territorial conquest and expansion. In Start Atlas, players are tasked with flying around and exploring the universe, discovering new planets and exploiting them for resources. They can trade with other players, create alliances, declare war on others, become a pirate and attack traders, make money from mining and more besides. It’s a truly open-ended experience. As ambitious as the game is, it has struggled to match the success of Web2-based MMORPG games, but the reason for its failure is not because the gameplay is lacking. Rather, Star Atlas seems to have put too much focus on its Web3 elements. To become successful in Star Atlas and compete with the best, players have little choice but to immerse themselves in the DeFi aspects of the game. Star Atlas’s economy is heavily focused on the idea of lending, where players either need to borrow money to get started in the game by purchasing essential resources, or make money by lending it out to keep up with the profitability of their rivals. The key to making money in Star Atlas is to become an expert in yield farming, which involves identifying assets to borrow at lower yields, then trading and lending them out at higher yields to make money on the spread. Of course, to negotiate these markets one needs the skills of a DeFi trader or an economist, and managing these investments quickly becomes a major headache, distracting the player from the actual fun aspects of the game. Just like Axie Infinity, Star Atlas was guilty of putting too much emphasis on the Web3 aspects of the game. Whereas Axie was singularly focused on making money by winning repetitive battles over and over, Star Atlas became more of a trading experience, where users found themselves immersed in financial markets in a struggle to make enough money to compete against their richer rivals. Neither game put much emphasis on having fun. This kind of experience can quickly alienate the traditional gamer, especially casual gamers who simply want to pick up and play for 20 minutes of fun before they get back to work or class or go and hang out with their friends. For Web3 games to succeed, developers need to realize that, first and foremost, most players want a game that’s fun, making it enjoyable to play, and they want an experience that’s addictive, so they keep coming back for more. The secret for success is to focus on the game first, make sure it’s fun and engaging so they have a foundation of captivating gameplay that can be enhanced with Web3 functionality. In other words, Web3 needs to be more of an add-on rather than the main focus of the experience, and it’s something that very few blockchain games have done to date. However, there are signs that some developers are beginning to get the balance right. The new mobile gameDrift Zone: Arenais fast gaining popularity on Telegram, where it’s available to play as a mini-app that doesn’t even need to be downloaded. It takes advantage of Telegram’s integration with the TON blockchain to give players access to a ready-made wallet they can use to store their DT tokens that are central to the game’s economy. Drift Zone: Arena is a card-based battle game, where players collect “Drifters”, which represent different characters they can use to fight against other players in auto-battles, with the outcome determined by the attributes of each one. Players compete in one-on-one, player-vs-player battles to earn coins and climb the ranks of the leaderboard. There’s a lot of emphasis on strategy, as players can use the coins they earn to upgrade their Drifters or even merge them together to create even more powerful and advanced Drifters with more lethal attributes, leaving lots of room for experimentation. As players progress through the 18 available levels, they face new challenges and earn different rewards along the way. Progressing through the levels is not as simple as it looks, though, for players will not only need to accumulate enough coins, but also prove themselves out on the battleground. Drift Zone: Arena’s secret is that most players won’t even realize that they’re playing a crypto game. The DT tokens they earn from winning battles are a bona fide cryptocurrency that can be bought and sold on crypto exchanges, but players won’t realize this unless they specifically research it to find out for themselves. That’s because the developers of the game only ever emphasize the gameplay itself. It can be thought of as a kind of “stealth blockchain game” that’s easy to access and fun, with exciting gameplay and unpredictable rewards on offer. Players don’t need to know anything about blockchain or crypto to play the game, the only thing they’ll know is that they’ll enjoy playing it. By focusing on elevating the gameplay experience, developers of Web3 games can succeed where those who went before they failed to make a long lasting impact. If a game is to enjoy any kind of longevity, it needs to provide a polished and engaging gameplay experience that’s accessible to every kind of player, and not just the crypto natives. With Web3 games, the rewards should never be the reason for playing the game. Only when people are playing blockchain games for fun will the concept start to take off.

    "news_title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price - blockchainreporter",
    "news_content": "Current price of Ethereum:USD per ETH as ofNovember 3, 2022. 24-hour trading volume:. Today's Market Cap:. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. These are applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of fraud or third-party interference. Ethereum provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. At the center of Ethereum is “Ether”, or ETH, the platform’s native cryptocurrency, which can be transferred between accounts and is used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed. “Gas”, an internal transaction pricing mechanism denominated in ETH, is used to mitigate spam and allocate resources on the network. Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. He later founded the Ethereum Foundation with Dr. Gavin Wood and Joseph Lubin. Dr. Wood went on to form Polkadot, an interoperable, EVM-compatible smart contracting platform. In all, there are six co-founders behind the Ethereum network, including the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson. Presently, Ethereum is the second most valuable network by market cap. It hosts a variety of projects in DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse, Gaming, and more. Ethereum has attracted interest from both the general public and the technological community. The attention garnered is primarily because of ETH’s valuation and the network’s immense value to builders and projects across the globe. Ethereum price is affected by various factors, including global economic conditions, innovation within the Ethereum network, and overall demand from buyers and sellers. Global economic conditions can impact the price of Ethereum by affecting the demand for cryptocurrency assets as an alternative investment or store of value. For example, if there is increased uncertainty in the traditional financial markets, investors may seek out Ethereum as a safe haven asset. Similarly, if there is a period of economic growth, investors may be more likely to put their money into Ethereum as a speculative investment. This cyclic nature of investor sentiment was observed in the boom of 2020 and 2021, with the crypto winter of 2022 massively impacting crypto valuations. Inflation worries saw capital being shifted to fiat and away from speculative, volatile digital assets, which ETH falls under. Innovation within the Ethereum network can also affect the price of the cryptocurrency. For example, if a new high-profile project is built on top of the Ethereum network that gains widespread adoption, the price of ETH may rise in response to the increased demand. Innovation can also extend to on-chain improvements like the “Merge” of Q3 2022, which saw Ethereum move from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system while laying the foundation for scaling. On the other hand, if there is a major security breach or technical issue within Ethereum, ETH may fall as trader and investor confidence in the platform diminishes. Market forces of demand and supply also impact ETH prices. If more people are looking to buy the coin than those willing to sell, prices will undoubtedly go up. The reverse is true. The market forces of supply and demand are among the most important factors influencing the price of ETH, especially considering that crypto markets are developing.

    "news_content": "Current price of Polkadot:USD per DOT as ofNovember 3, 2022. 24-hour trading volume:. Today's Market Cap:. Polkadot is a multi-chain network that enables interoperability between different blockchains. It consists of two parts: the relay chain and the parachains. The relay chain is the main chain that connects all the parachains, while the parachains are the individual chains that run in parallel to each other. A parachain is similar to a sidechain in that it is a separate blockchain attached to the main blockchain (known as the relay chain). However, it has independent validators and can process transactions in parallel with the relay chain. This makes it possible for the Polkadot network to scale horizontally and support many transactions. Polkadot enables these different chains to interact, allowing a more seamless experience for users and developers. DOT is a digital asset used to participate in the Polkadot network. DOT holders can vote on governance proposals, validate transactions, and earn rewards for their participation. Because of DOT, the interoperable network remains decentralized, allowing validators to power transfers between compatible blockchains at any time. DOT has no total supply and is inflationary. On launch, 1 billion DOT was issued, and the number will continue to rise over time. Polkadot has a broad support base with active developers. Besides, the project’s foundation is solid. In their quest to develop a highly innovative and scalable blockchain project with cross-chain capabilities, DOT has increasingly become the center of attention. Overly, the price of DOT is affected by the following factors: There are a few key factors that affect the price of Polkadot (DOT), and these include: BlockchainReporter is a trusted name in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology news space, keeping its readers abreast of the latest and most significant trends in the industry.

    "news_title": "Shiba INU (SHIB) Price - blockchainreporter",
    "news_content": "Current price of Shiba INU:USD per SHIB as ofNovember 3, 2022. 24-hour trading volume:. Today's Market Cap:. Shiba INU crypto is a meme coin created to become the “Dogecoin killer”. It has a similar logo to Dogecoin, but with a Shiba Inu dog instead of a Shiba Inu. In crypto circles, a meme coin is a cryptocurrency based on or inspired by popular internet memes. Meme coin tokens often trade in cents due to their high supply. Still, this doesn’t prevent meme coins from trading in exchanges or attracting a huge global following. Their following is usually drawn by the token’s high volatility and ability to outperform more established projects, especially during trending markets. The founder of Shiba INU is anonymous and goes by the name Ryoshi. It is also not affiliated with any company or organization. However, the primary goal of Shiba INU is to outperform and eclipse Dogecoin, the original memecoin. Shiba INU developers have indicated that they do not plan to launch any centralized services or products in the spirit of decentralization and adherence to blockchain principles. Instead, the team plans to focus on building“a decentralized ecosystem of products and services that can be utilized by the community”. The release of features and products anchored on the blockchain increase the utility of SHIB, aiding in propelling the project even further. ShibaSwap is one of the projects released by Shiba INU developers. It is a DEX on Ethereum enabling trustless trading of tokens, including Shiba INU’s Shiboshi NFTs. The launch of ShibaSwap also saw the release of BONE and LEASH tokens. BONE has voting rights, while LEASH is for rewarding stakers who aid in processing transactions. Shiba INU are also developing their layer-2 solution called Shibarium. Tokenomics:SHIB, the native token of the project, is based on the Ethereum blockchain and complies with the ERC-20 token standard. There has been a lot of talk about SHIB’s total supply. According to trackers, SHIB has a total supply of 1,000 trillion, one of the highest total supplies in the world. Because of this high supply, it is highly unlikely that SHIB prices will surge above $1 in the near term. Rather, it will continue trading in cents. However, this doesn’t mean SHIB will trail the market. SHIB prices surged over 200X in the last bull cycle of 2020 to 2022, finding a slot in the top-15 at some point in 2021. Unexpected External Factors:On launch, 50 percent of the total SHIB supply was locked on Uniswap, a decentralized exchange for trading ERC-20 tokens. The remainder was sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. These tokens were considered “burnt” or irretrievable. At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vitalik did the unexpected by sending all sHIB tokens sent to his address, that is, 50 percent of the token supply, to assist in efforts to curb the disease in India. For this reason, SHIB prices plunged. Still, the token is one of the most traded and remains liquid, listed in several exchanges. Meme Coin Factor and Market Conditions:SHIB, as popular as it may, remains a meme coin. It is a tag that can be both good and bad. In bullish markets, speculators tend to pour on meme coins to “have fun” and to “make a killing” from joke tokens. Whenever prices begin falling, the same traders begin unloading the token, forcing liquidation across the board, negatively impacting prices.It is for this reason that traders should always watch out for the state of the market before initiating positions.

    "news_title": "Solana (SOL) Price - blockchainreporter",
    "news_content": "Current price of Solana:USD per SOL as ofNovember 3, 2022. 24-hour trading volume:. Today's Market Cap:. Solana is a platform that aims to build a high-performance decentralized network. The team behind Solana is focused on creating a platform that can scale to handle a large number of transactions per second (TPS) without sacrificing decentralization or security. One of the critical features of Solana is its use of Proof of History (PoH). This novel consensus algorithm allows the network to achieve high throughput while maintaining low latency. Moreover, Solana is designed to be highly energy efficient, making it more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work blockchain networks like Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum Classic, which dispense a lot of energy to keep their platforms operational and, most importantly, secure against malicious attacks. The idea to develop a superior alternative to Ethereum was first proposed in 2017 by the founder of Solana, Anatoly Yakovenko. However, it took three years before this was actualized. Solana launched in March 2020, coinciding with the great crypto boom that saw the platform draw the attention of developers and users attracted by the project’s promise of fast execution, low fees, and zero congestion. At this time, Ethereum was especially facing issues with fluctuating Gas fees which impacted interaction and user experience. SOL is the native currency of the Solana blockchain. It is used mainly for paying network fees as a utility. However, the coin can also be staked in various protocols for yield. Considering the performance of SOL over the past few years, the coin is available for trading in most cryptocurrency exchanges. For this reason, SOL remains liquid and preferred by most traders who closely watch its performance, expecting a repeat of the great SOL rally of 2020 to 2021. There are a number of factors that can affect the price of SOL: Prevailing Market Conditions:Solana, like the rest of the crypto market, is sensitive to market forces. Also, being an altcoin, the coin’s level of liquidity is relatively lower than Bitcoin and other established coins, including ETH, the native currency of Ethereum. In trending markets, SOL prices will outperform coins with deeper liquidity. However, in tumultuous conditions, the coin tends to shed value at a faster pace. Solana mainnet Beta Stability:Since launching its mainnet beta, Solana continues to post success. For instance, because of its relatively low, near zero fees, SOL remained in demand, forcing prices upwards during the bull market of 2020 to 2021. However, because of many outages caused by DDoS attacks, and coupled with falling market prices, the coin plunged as investors, protocols, and traders pulled out capital searching for safety. Network Activity:Solana is the home of DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse activities. Protocols are attracted to Solana because of its high throughput performance and negligible fees. When compared to Ethereum, Solana can be a suitable platform for protocols whose user base are sensitive to high trading fees and scalability. How SOL performs is also directly tied to network activity. The more protocols opt to launch on Solana, the higher the demand for SOL, the token used for paying fees, and this affects its market valuation in the secondary markets.

    "news_title": "Ripple (XRP) Price - blockchainreporter",
    "news_content": "Current price of Ripple:USD per XRP as ofNovember 3, 2022. 24-hour trading volume:. Today's Market Cap:. Ripple Inc. is a global blockchain Payments Company whose current CEO is Bradley Garlinghouse. The company offers a variety of financial solutions to help make it easier for people and businesses to send and receive money. Ripple Inc. has developed several innovative products and services, including the XRPL, allowing fast and convenient cross-border payments. XRPL is powered by XRP, a cryptocurrency that facilitates transactions on the blockchain platform. The XRPL network is like any other blockchain platform, and by using XRP, there is no central authority to approve transactions. Instead, the protocol is powered by distributed nodes to validate and confirm transactions. This makes transacting with XRP a very efficient and cost-effective way to send money across borders. As mentioned earlier, Ripple Inc. is a company that has developed several products that rely on XRP and the XRPL for service delivery. However, the two are distinct as they operate independently with diverging objectives. Nonetheless, this was not the case until early 2018, when XRP and Ripple were used interchangeably. XRP and XRPL are operated by a non-profit, Ripple Labs, the issuer of XRP, the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, Ripple Inc. uses XRP as a utility tool to help move value across borders cheaply and instantaneously. XRP is the native currency of the XRPL. Ripple Inc. runs a few XRPL nodes. By Q4 2022, they were the minority node operators of the XRPL after years of implementing a decentralization strategy that saw Ripple Inc. reduce their holding of XRP and diffuse control of the XRPL node operation to third parties. XRP is a good choice for trading because it is a very popular cryptocurrency widely listed on various exchanges, especially outside the United States. The coin also has a decent market capitalization with deep liquidity, allowing it to stand out from other crypto assets. This is directly derived from the value proposition of Ripple Inc., the firm that supports XRP and has developed several products around the coin. Fundamentally, using XRP to move value means lower fees and instant settlement. At the same time, the XRPL is energy efficient and doesn’t use heavy resources to guarantee decentralization, keeping the network operational and secure. There are also positive elements stemming from Ripple’s long history in the crypto sphere. Since launching in 2012, Ripple is among some of the oldest crypto projects that keep on going despite high levels of volatility. Still, XRP holders should closely keep track of regulator comments on the coin. In late 2022, the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple Inc., saying the firm sold XRP, which they assert are unregistered securities, and raised over $1.3 billion. Subsequently, XRP was delisted from some regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, like Coinbase, in the United States. However, XRP can still be traded in other jurisdictions. Mainstream exchanges like Binance offer spot and derivatives trading of XRP.

    "news_title": "The Ideal Web3 Game Must Have Web2-Style Gameplay",
    "news_content": "The slow but sure rise of Web3 has given birth to the concept of “play-to-earn” games that integrate with blockchain to provide players with ownership of their gaming assets and the ability to get paid for doing what they love best. But despite some initial success, notably during the height of the COVID pandemic when some people claimed to be making enough money to pay their living costs simply by playing games, Web3 game titles remain something of a niche product, with very fewrealvideo games players embracing them. You might not be able to make any money playing popular video games like Grand Theft Auto, Ghost Recon and Fortnite, but most players don’t actually care about this. The reason they play games is because they want to have fun, and that appears to be something that Web3 games developers have forgotten about in their rush to bring blockchain gaming to the fore. Games like Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties both enjoyed a comparative degree of success, creating strong communities around their games, making headlines around the world. They were early showcases of how blockchain can be used to create unique digital assets from NFTs. These NFTs represent in-game assets, like characters, skins, weapons and accessories, that players can own and trade freely with one another. Blockchain also supports the creation of tokens, or in-game currencies that players can earn as rewards for winning battles and progressing through the game, enabling them to monetize their time and effort. The idea of getting paid for playing games is intriguing and it was undoubtedly the reason why Axie Infinity became so popular circa 2021, with some players reporting that they could earn hundreds of dollars per week. However, it was also the reason why Axie Infinity failed. Ultimately, the in-game economy proved itself to be unsustainable, as it was reliant on a continual flow of new players entering the game to provide capital for existing players to earn. The gameplay itself was seen asrepetitive and boring, and with the ever-dwindling profits being the only real incentive for people to keep playing, it struggled to keep adding them. When Axie fell by the wayside, a new generation of crypto games emerged that have focused on improving the gameplay and making the experience more enjoyable. Star Atlasbilled itself as the first AAA play-to-earn game, with its awe-inspiring graphics and an enormous gaming universe that one player alone could never hope to explore. As a space-based MMORPG exploration, trading and mining game, Star Atlas aimed to merge blockchain with real-time graphics, immersive gameplay and DeFi-like mechanics. Its stunning visuals were enabled by Unreal Engine 5’s Nanite system, creating an expansive universe of truly alien worlds ripe for territorial conquest and expansion. In Start Atlas, players are tasked with flying around and exploring the universe, discovering new planets and exploiting them for resources. They can trade with other players, create alliances, declare war on others, become a pirate and attack traders, make money from mining and more besides. It’s a truly open-ended experience. As ambitious as the game is, it has struggled to match the success of Web2-based MMORPG games, but the reason for its failure is not because the gameplay is lacking. Rather, Star Atlas seems to have put too much focus on its Web3 elements. To become successful in Star Atlas and compete with the best, players have little choice but to immerse themselves in the DeFi aspects of the game. Star Atlas’s economy is heavily focused on the idea of lending, where players either need to borrow money to get started in the game by purchasing essential resources, or make money by lending it out to keep up with the profitability of their rivals. The key to making money in Star Atlas is to become an expert in yield farming, which involves identifying assets to borrow at lower yields, then trading and lending them out at higher yields to make money on the spread. Of course, to negotiate these markets one needs the skills of a DeFi trader or an economist, and managing these investments quickly becomes a major headache, distracting the player from the actual fun aspects of the game. Just like Axie Infinity, Star Atlas was guilty of putting too much emphasis on the Web3 aspects of the game. Whereas Axie was singularly focused on making money by winning repetitive battles over and over, Star Atlas became more of a trading experience, where users found themselves immersed in financial markets in a struggle to make enough money to compete against their richer rivals. Neither game put much emphasis on having fun. This kind of experience can quickly alienate the traditional gamer, especially casual gamers who simply want to pick up and play for 20 minutes of fun before they get back to work or class or go and hang out with their friends. For Web3 games to succeed, developers need to realize that, first and foremost, most players want a game that’s fun, making it enjoyable to play, and they want an experience that’s addictive, so they keep coming back for more. The secret for success is to focus on the game first, make sure it’s fun and engaging so they have a foundation of captivating gameplay that can be enhanced with Web3 functionality. In other words, Web3 needs to be more of an add-on rather than the main focus of the experience, and it’s something that very few blockchain games have done to date. However, there are signs that some developers are beginning to get the balance right. The new mobile gameDrift Zone: Arenais fast gaining popularity on Telegram, where it’s available to play as a mini-app that doesn’t even need to be downloaded. It takes advantage of Telegram’s integration with the TON blockchain to give players access to a ready-made wallet they can use to store their DT tokens that are central to the game’s economy. Drift Zone: Arena is a card-based battle game, where players collect “Drifters”, which represent different characters they can use to fight against other players in auto-battles, with the outcome determined by the attributes of each one. Players compete in one-on-one, player-vs-player battles to earn coins and climb the ranks of the leaderboard. There’s a lot of emphasis on strategy, as players can use the coins they earn to upgrade their Drifters or even merge them together to create even more powerful and advanced Drifters with more lethal attributes, leaving lots of room for experimentation. As players progress through the 18 available levels, they face new challenges and earn different rewards along the way. Progressing through the levels is not as simple as it looks, though, for players will not only need to accumulate enough coins, but also prove themselves out on the battleground. Drift Zone: Arena’s secret is that most players won’t even realize that they’re playing a crypto game. The DT tokens they earn from winning battles are a bona fide cryptocurrency that can be bought and sold on crypto exchanges, but players won’t realize this unless they specifically research it to find out for themselves. That’s because the developers of the game only ever emphasize the gameplay itself. It can be thought of as a kind of “stealth blockchain game” that’s easy to access and fun, with exciting gameplay and unpredictable rewards on offer. Players don’t need to know anything about blockchain or crypto to play the game, the only thing they’ll know is that they’ll enjoy playing it. By focusing on elevating the gameplay experience, developers of Web3 games can succeed where those who went before they failed to make a long lasting impact. If a game is to enjoy any kind of longevity, it needs to provide a polished and engaging gameplay experience that’s accessible to every kind of player, and not just the crypto natives. With Web3 games, the rewards should never be the reason for playing the game. Only when people are playing blockchain games for fun will the concept start to take off.

    "news_content": "Chainlink has announced its DECO Sandbox is open to the public. This gives financial institutions andWeb3developers a hands-on environment to explore privacy-enhanced data solutions. The DECO Sandbox offers preconfigured use cases demonstrating privacy-preserving data verification methods for streamlined compliance processes and enhanced data security. The#ChainlinkDECO Sandbox is now officially open to the public 🏗️The sandbox provides preconfigured use cases and a framework to empower financial institutions and Web3 developers to start innovating on compliant and privacy-preserving data solutions.https://t.co/9fGvrxy9lc The DECO Sandbox introduces a zero-knowledge Transport Layer Security (zkTLS) oracle technology, which enables financial institutions to verify critical data, such as identity and proof of funds, without exposing sensitive details. This framework empowers financial services to carry out identity checks, creditworthiness verification, and liquidity confirmations, reducing reliance on outdated manual processes and enhancing data privacy compliance. Financial institutions face increasing compliance costs due to inefficient data handling practices in identity verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. The DECO Sandbox allows institutions to conduct KYC checks while preserving client privacy and addressing regulatory requirements and operational costs. By leveraging DECO, companies can validate client data while keeping sensitive information hidden from view, helping to mitigate data exposure risks that can result in severe financial penalties. The DECO Sandbox provides tools for Web3 developers to experiment with decentralized identity solutions, enabling them to verify credentials like creditworthiness without exposing personal information. This capability is particularly relevant for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that require proof of financial standing without requiring users to share detailed account information. DECO’s zero-knowledge framework supports the generation of verifiable, time-stamped attestations, which can be stored on-chain and referenced by smart contracts to verify compliance. By utilizing DECO’s privacy-first verification capabilities, financial institutions can manage critical regulatory processes such as sanctions screening and proof of funds with minimal data exposure. TheDECO technologyintegrates seamlessly into existing legacy systems without requiring modifications to data sources, allowing institutions to automate repetitive compliance tasks. This integration helps institutions maintain data integrity, minimize compliance costs, and securely interact with blockchain systems. DECO Sandbox provides financial institutions and Web3 developers with a unique opportunity to explore the potential of privacy-preserving data solutions and secure data verification methods across digital finance applications.

    "news_title": "First Digital Labs to Launch FDUSD Stablecoin on Solana",
    "news_content": "First Digital Labs has officially announced the launch of its FDUSD stablecoin on the Solana blockchain at Binance Blockchain Week. This news was shared on Solana’s official X account. The decision is meant to take advantage of Solana’s scalability and low fees for transactions. In this, FDUSD will become part of the growing Solana payments anddecentralized finance (DeFi)ecosystem. Bitcoin bull market begins with leveraged bets“The bull market will continue as#bitcoincontinues to be deposited into futures exchanges for leveraged bets using derivatives, rather than into spot exchanges for selling.” – By@t0_godLink 👇https://t.co/1egL7L2YoOpic.twitter.com/uuQPEiSWtb By October 28, 2024, First Digital has floated $2.6 billion in FDUSD in the numerous block chain platforms. This figure is from RWA.xyz. As FDUSD has entered Solana, it would join other prominent stablecoins. These are Circle’s USDC stablecoin, Tether’s USDT stablecoin, and PYUSD, the stablecoin linked to PayPal. The current increase in the availability of stablecoins implies a better resource to developers. This in turn results to better development of PayFi products for the users. Starting from December 2024, First Digital will release FDUSD natively on Solana. The integration of these two technologies is expected to have several important advantages for users. First, they can expect that the transaction will be much faster. FDUSD will employ Solana’s high speed blockchain platform. As such, transactions will be effectuated in seconds. This speed is good for real time payments and settlements. Moreover, the fees associated with transactions are also lower in the case of cryptocurrencies. The framework makes it cheaper to transfer value by making use of Solana. This makes it affordable and obligatory for wider acceptance into the market. In addition, improved scalability will guarantee that FDUSD meets the increasing requests as the population increases. The integration with Solana is one of the numerous plans for First Digital. They want to create a stablecoin system that is both diverse and robust. For now, FDUSD is compatible with Ethereum, BNB, and Sui. Integrating Solana will further increase the availability and liquidity of FDUSD compared to previous levels. Ultimately, this partnership can be considered as a positive shift of the blockchain market. It adds choices to the user end while offering framework for future development at the base end. There is more in store in FDUSD onSolana, and users should expect more product advancements in the future. Umair Younas is a cryptocurrency-related content writer linked with this work since 2019.

    "news_title": "Chainlink Opens DECO Sandbox for Privacy-Centric Data Verification in Finance",
    "news_content": "Chainlink has announced its DECO Sandbox is open to the public. This gives financial institutions andWeb3developers a hands-on environment to explore privacy-enhanced data solutions. The DECO Sandbox offers preconfigured use cases demonstrating privacy-preserving data verification methods for streamlined compliance processes and enhanced data security. The#ChainlinkDECO Sandbox is now officially open to the public 🏗️The sandbox provides preconfigured use cases and a framework to empower financial institutions and Web3 developers to start innovating on compliant and privacy-preserving data solutions.https://t.co/9fGvrxy9lc The DECO Sandbox introduces a zero-knowledge Transport Layer Security (zkTLS) oracle technology, which enables financial institutions to verify critical data, such as identity and proof of funds, without exposing sensitive details. This framework empowers financial services to carry out identity checks, creditworthiness verification, and liquidity confirmations, reducing reliance on outdated manual processes and enhancing data privacy compliance. Financial institutions face increasing compliance costs due to inefficient data handling practices in identity verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. The DECO Sandbox allows institutions to conduct KYC checks while preserving client privacy and addressing regulatory requirements and operational costs. By leveraging DECO, companies can validate client data while keeping sensitive information hidden from view, helping to mitigate data exposure risks that can result in severe financial penalties. The DECO Sandbox provides tools for Web3 developers to experiment with decentralized identity solutions, enabling them to verify credentials like creditworthiness without exposing personal information. This capability is particularly relevant for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that require proof of financial standing without requiring users to share detailed account information. DECO’s zero-knowledge framework supports the generation of verifiable, time-stamped attestations, which can be stored on-chain and referenced by smart contracts to verify compliance. By utilizing DECO’s privacy-first verification capabilities, financial institutions can manage critical regulatory processes such as sanctions screening and proof of funds with minimal data exposure. TheDECO technologyintegrates seamlessly into existing legacy systems without requiring modifications to data sources, allowing institutions to automate repetitive compliance tasks. This integration helps institutions maintain data integrity, minimize compliance costs, and securely interact with blockchain systems. DECO Sandbox provides financial institutions and Web3 developers with a unique opportunity to explore the potential of privacy-preserving data solutions and secure data verification methods across digital finance applications.

    "news_content": "In the ever-volatile cryptocurrency market, today’s trading session showcased a remarkable upturn, with several projects posting significant gains. As highlighted by the Phoenix Group’s latest update, the standout performer was Troy AI, which surged by an impressive 70.2%, signaling robust investor confidence and market dynamics. DAILY GAINERS$TROY+70.2%$TARA+40.3%$GFI+39.5%$MASK+34.6%$LINA+26.5%$GEL+24.6%$DEEP+20.9%$ZEUS+19.2%$PIXEL+18.8%$PAAL+17.7%#dailygainerspic.twitter.com/QDjpn8c4Ec Troy AI, a project aimed at leveraging artificial intelligence for trading strategies, saw its value increase to $0.003 with a market cap reaching $37.2 million. Close behind was Tara, another blockchain endeavor that rose by 40.3%, with its price now at $0.004 and a market cap of $20.3 million. These projects led the ‘Daily Gainers’ list, reflecting a growing interest in niche technologies within the crypto space. The data showsthat other cryptocurrencies also performed well in the market today. Goldfinch (GFI) recorded a 39.5% gain, followed closely by Mask Network (MASK) with a 34.6% increase, which is now trading at $3.16. Linear (LINA) and Gelato (GEL) each posted over 24% gains, indicative of broader market positivity. DeepBook and Zeus Network experienced growth of 20.9% and 19.2%, respectively, suggesting that both newer and established projects are finding their footing in the current market environment. Additionally, Pixels and Paal AI rounded out the list with gains nearing 19% and 18%, emphasizing the diverse range of projects that investors are currently backing. The collective increase in these projects’ market caps and prices on various major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit reflects a possibly bullish trend in the crypto world. This positive movement might be a precursor to further gains or could signal a temporary uptick in a generally unpredictable market. Investors and market spectators will be closely monitoring these trends to better understand the underlying factors driving today’s gains and to strategize for future investments. This surge across multiplecryptocurrenciesunderlines the dynamic and rapidly changing nature of the digital asset space, where investor sentiment and technological advancements continue to play critical roles in shaping market outcomes.

    "news_content": "First Digital Labs has officially announced the launch of its FDUSD stablecoin on the Solana blockchain at Binance Blockchain Week. This news was shared on Solana’s official X account. The decision is meant to take advantage of Solana’s scalability and low fees for transactions. In this, FDUSD will become part of the growing Solana payments anddecentralized finance (DeFi)ecosystem. Bitcoin bull market begins with leveraged bets“The bull market will continue as#bitcoincontinues to be deposited into futures exchanges for leveraged bets using derivatives, rather than into spot exchanges for selling.” – By@t0_godLink 👇https://t.co/1egL7L2YoOpic.twitter.com/uuQPEiSWtb By October 28, 2024, First Digital has floated $2.6 billion in FDUSD in the numerous block chain platforms. This figure is from RWA.xyz. As FDUSD has entered Solana, it would join other prominent stablecoins. These are Circle’s USDC stablecoin, Tether’s USDT stablecoin, and PYUSD, the stablecoin linked to PayPal. The current increase in the availability of stablecoins implies a better resource to developers. This in turn results to better development of PayFi products for the users. Starting from December 2024, First Digital will release FDUSD natively on Solana. The integration of these two technologies is expected to have several important advantages for users. First, they can expect that the transaction will be much faster. FDUSD will employ Solana’s high speed blockchain platform. As such, transactions will be effectuated in seconds. This speed is good for real time payments and settlements. Moreover, the fees associated with transactions are also lower in the case of cryptocurrencies. The framework makes it cheaper to transfer value by making use of Solana. This makes it affordable and obligatory for wider acceptance into the market. In addition, improved scalability will guarantee that FDUSD meets the increasing requests as the population increases. The integration with Solana is one of the numerous plans for First Digital. They want to create a stablecoin system that is both diverse and robust. For now, FDUSD is compatible with Ethereum, BNB, and Sui. Integrating Solana will further increase the availability and liquidity of FDUSD compared to previous levels. Ultimately, this partnership can be considered as a positive shift of the blockchain market. It adds choices to the user end while offering framework for future development at the base end. There is more in store in FDUSD onSolana, and users should expect more product advancements in the future. Umair Younas is a cryptocurrency-related content writer linked with this work since 2019.

    "news_title": "Optimism, Celestia, and dYdX Among the Top Upcoming Unlocks",
    "news_content": "The upcoming series of token unlocks includes projects such as Optimism, Celestia, and dYdX, each of which intends to release a huge percentage of their tokens within the next few days. These upcoming token unlocks in the cryptocurrency market will be quite significant because several blockchain projects are about to release a large volume of tokens in the market. MAJOR UPCOMING TOKEN UNLOCKS#Optimism$OP#SelfChain$SLF#Celestia$TIA#MaverickProtocol$MAV#dYdX$DYDX#HookedProtocol$HOOK#TARSProtocol$TAI#Sui$SUI#Neutron$NTRNpic.twitter.com/G7Y2aA2N2f Token unlocks usually have effects on the market, and especially with large percentages of the supply, these could lead to changes in prices, the overall market liquidity, and investor sentiment. These next token unlock events start withOptimism (OP), which is an established Layer 2 scaling solution forEthereum. Optimism intends to unlock 32.21M OP tokens, equivalent to 0.75% of its total supply, with a value of $55.75M. Priced at $0.56 each, it is scheduled for release on 31st October. Yet another major project is Self Chain (SLF), which plans to release 1.52M SLF tokens on October 31. While this is a small percentage of Self Chain’s token for a total circulating supply, the unlocked tokens have a value of approximately $459,830. The smaller percentage may ease market impacts. However, it contributes to the total amount of SLF that may shift short-term trading. The most significant amount of value is provided by Celestia (TIA), a modular blockchain platform with an emphasis on scalability. Celestia is to launch 175.74M TIA tokens, which makes 16.30% of the total supply and is equal to $879.13M. The Celestia token unlock is to occur on October 31st and is one of the largest in this series. After the unlocks in October,Maverick Protocolwill unlock 15.52M MAV tokens on November 1, which is 0.78% of the total supply, worth approximately $2.53M. Even though this unlock is small, it will indeed expand MAV’s supply in circulation and may impact its short-term price movements. On the same day, a decentralized trading platform based on Ethereum called dYdX (DYDX) will free up 8.33M DYDX tokens or 1.84 % of supply with a value of $8.64M. ConsideringdYdX’spositioning as a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, this release may affect the platform’s liquidity and trading volume. Another education-related blockchain project, Hooked Protocol (HOOK), is also planned for unlock on November 1, which will release 8.33M HOOK tokens or 1.67% of the total supply with a value of $3.38M. TARS Protocol (TAI) will have 28.59M TAI tokens unlocked on November 2, which approximately amounts to 3.19% of the total number of tokens and is valued at $3.98M. Two major unlocks will follow on November 3: Sui (SUI) and Neutron (NTRN). Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain that focuses on scalability and performance, which aims to unlock 81.91M SUI tokens, which is 0.82% of the total supply of $ 167.16M. On the other hand, Neutron will release 9.96M NTRN tokens, which is 1.00% of the project’s total token supply, with an estimated value of $3.84M. Unlocking tokens allows information about the project, its activity, investor attitude, the chances for growth, or the volatility of the rate. These unlocks will be anticipated keenly by the market players, though implications to the rest of the crypto market may come about as a result of re-strategizing.

Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain that focuses on scalability and performance, which aims to unlock 81.91M SUI tokens, which is 0.82% of the total supply of $ 167.16M. On the other hand, Neutron will release 9.96M NTRN tokens, which is 1.00% of the project’s total token supply, with an estimated value of $3.84M. Unlocking tokens allows information about the project, its activity, investor attitude, the chances for growth, or the volatility of the rate. These unlocks will be anticipated keenly by the market players, though implications to the rest of the crypto market may come about as a result of re-strategizing.

    "news_title": "Chainlink Unveils CRE Upgrade to Boost Blockchain Network Integration",
    "news_content": "Chainlink has launched a significant upgrade called the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE). This new platform features a modular and composable architecture. It aims to enhance scalability across thousands of blockchain networks. Developers can create custom workflows tailored to their specific needs. The news was shared on Chainlink’s official X account. Introducing Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)—a major platform upgrade:🔌 New modular, composable architecture⛓️ Scalable across 1000s of chains🏦 Deep customization for capital markets users🏗️ Self-serve product development🧵⬇️https://t.co/BE807PgfB2 The CRE breaks down key functions of an oracle network into elemental forms of capability. These are reading from a blockchain and calling APIs. These functions can be mixed in a number of ways that developers prefer most. This flexibility let them to implement the possible workflows according to the requirements of the applications. The CRE is essentially at the center of the Chainlink ecosystem and serves as the platform’s driver. It runs workflows when their initiators are initiated. It also relies on decentralized oracle networks (DONs) to securely interconnect different capabilities. One of the greatest benefits of this upgrade is self-serve product development. The Chainlink platform allows developers to compose capabilities directly on the platform. They do not need to write Chainlink-specific code to be embedded into the coreon-chaincomputation. This makes it easy to communicate and or transact across different blockchains conveniently. In addition, the process of re-architecture offers a number of advantages. It has programable work flows that can satisfy specific requirements. It also supports familiar programming languages and tools. Moreover, there is an opportunity to use standardized components for cross-chain interaction. The deployment of this upgrade will be gradual. This approach guarantees safeguarding of the existing users all through the transition. The first stage is dedicated to migrating services such as Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to the new platform foundation. This will assist Chainlink to expand more efficiently. At the same time, new chain integrations are being introduced, such as the Aptos blockchain. This enhanced architecture has enabled financial institutions to integrate their existing systems with blockchains. This integration helps in workflows like the Delivery vs Payment. CRE users who want to create and experiment with workflows are welcome to join the early access program of the platform. Ultimately, this can be considered a major advancement for bothChainlinkand its users. Umair Younas is a cryptocurrency-related content writer linked with this work since 2019.

Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just starting out, this calculator empowers you to make informed decisions about your cryptocurrency portfolio. Our user-friendly calculator allows you to: By providing a clear view of potential outcomes, this tool helps you strategize your investments, understand your risk exposure, and plan your financial future in the exciting realm of cryptocurrencies. Start calculating now and take control of your crypto journey! Follow these simple steps to calculate your potential crypto profits or losses: Explanation of Input Fields: Remember, the more accurate your inputs, the more reliable your profit/loss projection will be. Use this calculator to experiment with different scenarios and make more informed investment decisions! Explore Our “What If” Crypto Investment Simulator Ever wondered how much you could have made if you’d invested in Bitcoin or Ethereum years ago? Our “What If” calculator lets you travel back in time and see the potential outcomes of past investments. This feature is perfect for understanding historical trends and the potential of long-term crypto investments. Remember, while it’s fun to imagine past scenarios, it’s more important to focus on current and future investment strategies. Profit in cryptocurrency is calculated by subtracting your initial investment and any associated fees from the final value of your holdings. The formula is: Profit = (Sell Price × Quantity) – (Buy Price × Quantity) – Fees Reinvesting crypto profits can potentially increase your returns, but it also carries risks. Consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and overall investment strategy. It’s often wise to diversify your investments and not put all your profits back into crypto. Several factors influence crypto profitability, including market volatility, regulatory changes, technological advancements, adoption rates, and overall market sentiment. While it’s tempting to check constantly, most experts recommend reviewing your portfolio monthly or quarterly. This helps you make informed decisions without getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations. Yes, but keep in mind that day trading often involves multiple transactions and varying fees. For precise day trading calculations, you may need to input each transaction separately. Our calculator provides estimates based on the information you input. For the most accurate results, ensure you include all relevant fees and use precise buy/sell prices. Realized gains occur when you actually sell your cryptocurrency for a profit. Unrealized gains (or “paper gains”) represent the profit you would make if you sold at the current market price, but you haven’t actually sold yet. Cryptocurrency transactions have tax implications in most countries. Here are key points to remember: Remember:Tax laws are complex and vary by location. This overview is not tax advice. For personalized guidance, consult a tax professional familiar with cryptocurrency regulations in your area.

    "news_title": "Chainlink Unveils CRE Upgrade to Boost Blockchain Network Integration",
    "news_content": "Chainlink has launched a significant upgrade called the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE). This new platform features a modular and composable architecture. It aims to enhance scalability across thousands of blockchain networks. Developers can create custom workflows tailored to their specific needs. The news was shared on Chainlink’s official X account. Introducing Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)—a major platform upgrade:🔌 New modular, composable architecture⛓️ Scalable across 1000s of chains🏦 Deep customization for capital markets users🏗️ Self-serve product development🧵⬇️https://t.co/BE807PgfB2 The CRE breaks down key functions of an oracle network into elemental forms of capability. These are reading from a blockchain and calling APIs. These functions can be mixed in a number of ways that developers prefer most. This flexibility let them to implement the possible workflows according to the requirements of the applications. The CRE is essentially at the center of the Chainlink ecosystem and serves as the platform’s driver. It runs workflows when their initiators are initiated. It also relies on decentralized oracle networks (DONs) to securely interconnect different capabilities. One of the greatest benefits of this upgrade is self-serve product development. The Chainlink platform allows developers to compose capabilities directly on the platform. They do not need to write Chainlink-specific code to be embedded into the coreon-chaincomputation. This makes it easy to communicate and or transact across different blockchains conveniently. In addition, the process of re-architecture offers a number of advantages. It has programable work flows that can satisfy specific requirements. It also supports familiar programming languages and tools. Moreover, there is an opportunity to use standardized components for cross-chain interaction. The deployment of this upgrade will be gradual. This approach guarantees safeguarding of the existing users all through the transition. The first stage is dedicated to migrating services such as Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to the new platform foundation. This will assist Chainlink to expand more efficiently. At the same time, new chain integrations are being introduced, such as the Aptos blockchain. This enhanced architecture has enabled financial institutions to integrate their existing systems with blockchains. This integration helps in workflows like the Delivery vs Payment. CRE users who want to create and experiment with workflows are welcome to join the early access program of the platform. Ultimately, this can be considered a major advancement for bothChainlinkand its users. Umair Younas is a cryptocurrency-related content writer linked with this work since 2019.

    "news_title": "Ika Launches on Sui, Revolutionizing MPC Solutions Across Blockchain",
    "news_content": "Ika, a multi-party computation (MPC) network previously called the dWallet Network, is now live on the Sui blockchain. Well-known for its sub-second latency and scalability, Ika aims to revolutionize multi-chain DeFi with secure and efficient solutions that do not require bridging. Ika provides a safer approach towards cross-chain bridging and promotes interconnectivity across different blockchains. Sui’s Mysticeti consensus mechanism governs the network, and the 2PC-MPC cryptographic solutions provide a zero-message latency with throughput capabilities of up to 10k TPS. Sui utilizes this advanced structure of MPC networks for Move smart contract developers to create decentralized services for institutional players. The MPC network of Ika backs use cases that strengthen Sui’s blockchain utility, like Programmable Bitcoin, which performs native $BTC operations. Furthermore, Ika’s solutions for interoperability ensure that DeFi operates fast and securely in Web 3.0, combining the liquidity of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains with Sui. Ika’s chain abstraction feature simplifies multi-chain complexities for developers, improving user experience through integrated zkLogin features on Sui. Moreover, Ika provides decentralized custody for digital assets onSui, delivering secure, institutional-grade storage solutions for individual and corporate users. Ika supports the Sui ecosystem and uses safe MPC boundaries for AI to guarantee its AI brokers work with limited authority while defending users and maintaining decentralized safety measures. The upcoming $IKA token launch on Sui will enhance the ecosystem further by facilitating secure transactions within Ika’s MPC network. As a native token, $IKA will serve as the principal method for transaction payments, securing and expanding decentralized services across Web3. Ika strengthens its scalable infrastructure on Sui, marking a significant step toward scalable, secure blockchain interoperability for institutional and individual use cases. Ika’s alpha testnet is already available on Sui, with a mainnet launch set for December. Integrating Ika’s high-speed MPC technology on Sui is expected to secure further and diversify decentralized solutions, positioning Sui as a leading platform for cross-chain DeFi and programmable $BTC solutions.

    "news_content": "Table of Contents Ethereum (ETH), ranking as the second-largest cryptocurrency globally, is widely recognized for its extensive and interesting features as a blockchain platform. It serves its role as just a cryptocurrency, earning high esteem among crypto enthusiasts for its significant worth and the distinct investment opportunities it offers. Recently, Ethereum has gained spotlight following spot Bitcoin ETFapprovalby the SEC. In 2023, while the US crypto market was focused on Bitcoin ETFs, Blackrock’s proposal for an Ethereum-based ETF shifted the spotlight to Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. This shift, alongside a positive market trend and a crypto rally in late October, helped Ethereum’s value surpass $2,000, a significant milestone it hadn’t reached in months. Ethereum’s rise was further triggered after the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, leading to a peak in Ethereum’s value in nearly two years by January 12. Looking ahead, Ethereum is set for notable upgrades with the upcoming Deneb and Cancun updates. The Dencun upgrade is particularly significant, introducing proto-danksharding to improve network scalability, reduce gas fees for users, and enhance interoperability with other blockchains, paving the way for more efficient cross-chain interactions. Amid all these, our Ethereum price prediction aims to explore the future trend of ETH price with in-depth technical analysis to offer profitable investment opportunities. Looking for crypto with more potential than Ethereum? Explore our guide to thebest crypto to buy now. Ethereum, launched in 2015, revolutionized blockchain technology by enabling the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) beyond just supporting cryptocurrencies. It introduced its native coin, Ether (commonly referred to as Ethereum or ETH), which is used for transactions on the blockchain.[ccpw id=60480]can be traded, staked for blockchain contributions, and was initially part of a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, where complex computations added blocks to the blockchain. However, this system was environmentally costly, using more energy annually than Kazakhstan, and led to slow, congested transactions. And we finalized!Happy merge all. This is a big moment for the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone who helped make the merge happen should feel very proud today. To address these issues,[ccpw id=60480]transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism in 2020, allowing holders to add blocks based on their ETH holdings. This shift, known asThe Merge, was completed on September 15, 2022, making the network more efficient and environmentally friendly. Currently, with 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs operational, the crypto community is speculating about the potential approval and timing of a spot Ethereum ETF. However, the situation is complex. The SEC has not clarified if ether qualifies as a security, a determination that could impede an ETF’s approval. Furthermore, the SEC’s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF was contentious, narrowly passing with a one-vote margin, including SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s vote. Gensler emphasized that this approval does not equate to an endorsement of Bitcoin by the SEC and should not be interpreted as openness to approving crypto asset securities in general. Reporting on the timeline for a potential$ETHETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the@SECGov.✨One$BTCSpot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they’re confident the… These factors, among others, have led to mixed opinions about the likelihood of a spot Ethereum ETF being approved soon. While banks generally view such approval as improbable, crypto experts maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook. Proponents expecting a spot Ethereum ETF approval this year draw parallels to the recent approval process of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Matt Kunke, a research analyst at the crypto market making firm GSR, predicts a 75% chance of a spot Ethereum ETF approval in May. His optimism is based on Grayscale’s Court of Appeals victory and the subsequent green light for Ethereum Futures ETF. He believes these developments indicate that a spot Ethereum ETF approval is imminent. Kunke also noted that if the SEC rejects the current spot Ethereum ETF applications in May, an appeal is likely to follow. In such a scenario, he suggests that the SEC might choose the easier route of approval, while still maintaining a cautious approach towards other cryptocurrencies. The SEC has recently postponed Grayscale Investments’ request to transform its Ethereum trust product (ETHE) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This decision came just a day after the SEC similarly deferred BlackRock’s application for a comparable ETF proposal. Market sentiment has shown a degree of optimism regarding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETF by May 23, the deadline set by the SEC for the Ark 21Shares application. However, according to JPMorgan (JPM), the likelihood of the SEC granting approval for the ETF by this date is estimated to be no higher than 50%. [ccpw id=60480]price history has seen significant fluctuations. Launching at around $2.77 in 2015, it surpassed $10 in 2016 but faced setbacks due to a hack. In 2017, it crossed $100 and briefly went over $1,000 in early 2018 during a crypto bubble, then stabilized around $300 for the next three years. In early 2021, Ethereum’s price surged, nearly reaching $4,000 in May. Despite a summer dip, it rebounded, partly driven by the NFT craze.[ccpw id=60480]hit a record high of $4,891.70 in November as[ccpw id=60415]also soared. 2022 was challenging for crypto, with Ethereum nearly falling below $1,000 despite the successful completion of The Merge. In 2023, Ethereum saw a period of recovery, surpassing the $2,000 mark in April for the first time in almost a year. However, it experienced a downturn in early June, dropping to $1,624.14 by June 15. The market then rebounded, andfollowing a decisionthat Ripple’s XRP was not a security on exchanges, Ethereum peaked at $2,026.20 on July 14. By December 9, Ethereum’s value climbed to $2,401.76, the highest since May 2022. On December 13, it was trading around $2,180. The price peaked again at $2,445.02 on December 28, before closing the year at $2,281.47. However, Ethereum started this year on a bearish note as spot Bitcoin ETF approval triggered a ‘sell the news’ event in the market, plunging ETH price toward the $2,100 level. Ether gained momentum after it surpassed the $2,400 resistance level, showcasing strong buying interest from investors. Over the last few hours, ETH price faced strong buying pressure near the $2,700 level and knocked the $2,830 level; however, it faced resistance from the bears. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,802, surging over 1.9% from yesterday’s rate. Investors are currently attempting to hold the price beyond the $2,800 resistance, indicating a continuation of the upward trend. Should the buyers maintain the upward trend above immediate Fib channels, the ETH/USDT pair might surge to the key $3,000 mark. At this level, short-term traders could begin to take profits and trigger a correction. The pressure is increasing on the bears. To plunge the bullish momentum, they must lower and keep the price under the EMA20 trend line. If successful, the pair could retreat to the $2,600 level and might prepare for a retest of the $2,400 level. However, this support zone will likely attract buyers to accumulate more ETH.

VanEck believes that, under favorable conditions, Ethereum’s market cap could surpass $2 trillion. Ben Ritchie, the managing director of Digital Capital Management, forecasts that Ethereum could potentially end the year at around $2,500, provided positive developments continue. Well-known cryptocurrency blogs such as Gov Capital and Traders Union also share a bullish outlook on Ethereum. Gov Capital predicts Ethereum’s value could reach $7,200 by 2025. Anton Kharitonov, an analyst at Traders Union, anticipates that Ethereum could be trading at about $6,196.08 by the end of 2025, with the potential to increase to $31,656.34 by 2030. Determining Ethereum’s future performance is challenging. The cryptocurrency has shown strong buying confidence, recovering well from the news of the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. Additionally, Ethereum is progressing with new upgrades and there’s rising speculation about a potential spot Ethereum ETF, which has positively influenced its price. However, the much-anticipated Merge, expected to significantly enhance Ethereum, did not have a substantial impact on its price. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies also means that Ethereum’s value could decrease at any moment. It’s noteworthy that Bitcoin’s value declined following the approval of its spot ETFs last week. Conversely, the increasing amount of Ethereum being staked indicates that The Merge has been technically successful and well-received in the community. It is suggested to invest in ETH at a price of $1,800-$1,900 for a solid return in the long term. Ethereum, renowned as a technologically advanced and established cryptocurrency, is poised to maintain its leading position in the altcoin market in the upcoming years, as indicated by the aforementioned Ethereum price prediction. Differing from Bitcoin, Ethereum functions as a utility token. While its price is significantly influenced by Bitcoin’s movements and broader macroeconomic factors, Ethereum’s value is also affected by a variety of crypto-specific elements. Additionally, the trends in cryptocurrency and equity markets typically exhibit parallel movements. However, over the past year, these markets have shown a divergence. For instance, numerous tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL) have reached all-time highs, while the cryptocurrency sector continues to experience a bear market. Recent improvements in macroeconomic conditions, like the slowdown in inflation and the Federal Reserve’s pause on interest rate hikes, have not led to a corresponding positive impact on cryptocurrency prices, includingEthereum. This raises questions about the factors influencing the crypto market’s reaction to these economic changes. Ethereum is a blockchain platform that introduced Ether (ETH), a cryptocurrency used for transactions on its network. Launched in 2015, Ethereum is notable for enabling decentralized applications (DApps) and transitioning to a more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system. Ethereum ETFs are proposed exchange-traded funds based on Ethereum. The current status is uncertain, as the SEC has not yet approved any Ethereum ETFs, and their potential impact on Ethereum’s value and the broader crypto market is a subject of speculation. Ethereum’s price could be influenced by various factors including market trends, technological upgrades like Deneb and Cancun, regulatory decisions, the outcome of Ethereum ETFs, and overall investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Investing in Ethereum depends on individual risk tolerance and market analysis. The cryptocurrency is known for its volatility. Potential investors might consider buying during price dips, but should be aware of the market’s unpredictability and do thorough research before investing.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Price Prediction",
    "news_content": "Table of Contents Since its establishment in 2009, Bitcoin, the earliest form of cryptocurrency, has gained interest from a diverse group including enthusiasts, investors, fraudsters, and, more recently, regulatory bodies. For a significant number of its proponents, Bitcoin represents more than just an alternative currency; it is a revolutionary technological innovation that introduced the concept of decentralized currencies to the world, laying the foundation for a novel economic sphere—the cryptocurrency market. Conversely, for some individuals, Bitcoin presented an opportunity for rapid financial gain. While a portion of these early investors succeeded in becoming Bitcoin millionaires, a larger number experienced substantial financial losses in their attempts to navigate its volatile price fluctuations. Since the start of 2024, the value of Bitcoin has experienced significant fluctuations, initially falling to around $38,000 from a high of $49,000. This shift occurred following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s historic decisionto approvespot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Amidst intensifying ‘sell the news’ trends and increasing outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), smart investors have been quietly accumulating Bitcoin in anticipation of the highly-awaited Bitcoin halving event set for April. In ourBitcoin price prediction, we will conduct a thorough technical examination of BTC price to assess the likelihood of Bitcoin reaching the $100,000 mark by the end of 2024. Looking for crypto with more potential than Bitcoin? Explore our guide to thebest crypto to buy now. Bitcoin, recognized as the inaugural cryptocurrency and the one with the highest market capitalization, operates on a proof-of-work algorithm to authenticate transactions within its global peer-to-peer network. It stands as one of the select cryptocurrencies that regulators in the United States and internationally regard as fully decentralized. The primary use of Bitcoin is in the sector of payments. It facilitates the transfer of funds between individuals or for the payment of goods and services, both online and increasingly at physical retail locations. An expanding roster of businesses worldwide now accepts Bitcoin as a mode of payment, offering a way to transact across borders without the usual fees associated with foreign transactions or currency conversion. The creation of new Bitcoin and the validation of transactions are accomplished through a process called mining. This activity has evolved into a profitable global industry, with several Bitcoin mining companies publicly traded. In a recent development, [ccpw id=60415] has ventured into the realm of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), exemplified by a project named Bitcoin Ordinals. New Bitcoin is produced with each block (approximately every 10 minutes), with the current reward at 6.25 Bitcoin per block. This reward halves approximately every four years, in an event known as the Bitcoin Halving. The next halving, predicted around April 19th, will reduce the reward to 3.125 Bitcoin per block. The Halving helps control inflation and supply, maintaining Bitcoin’s value as it has a capped supply of 21 million, with about 19.56 million currently in circulation. These events historically precede significant price increases. For example, post-2012 and 2016 halvings, Bitcoin’s price surged 50% and 3,000%, respectively. After the 2020 halving, it reached $68,789 within seven months. If we consider post-halving prices, then for 2024, we predict a new all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin at $85,000, with a low of $35,000 early in the year and an average price around $60,000. In 2024, Bitcoin’s performance is likely to be influenced by various factors such as growing institutional adoption, the halving event, regulatory environments, and global economic conditions. The crypto sector faced challenges in 2023, notably when the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission took legal action againstBinanceand its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, which initially hurt market confidence. However, confidence improved when Binance settled with the U.S. Treasury and Department of Justice, and Zhao stepped down. This resolution positively impacted the crypto market and prices. Looking ahead, the market is optimistic, partly due to the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinting at the end of interest rate hikes, which could boost Bitcoin. Analysts predict rate cuts in 2024, although further hikes are possible if inflation increases. Bitcoin has already seen an 80% increase since 2022’s crash, outperforming many assets. There’s excitement about [ccpw id=60415] potentially breaking its all-time high this year, with some experts suggesting it could reach $100,000, although this is a bit impossible in 2024. Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, in 2009, utilizing blockchain technology. Initially of little value, Bitcoin gained traction between 2013 and 2015 and saw its first significant surge in 2017, reaching over $15,000. It hit further highs in 2019 and a record $68,789.63 in 2021. However, by December 2022, its value fell to $15,760 amid a “crypto winter” due to factors like inflation, the Russia-Ukraine War, energy crises, and crypto industry collapses. In January 2023, Bitcoin began recovering, climbing 83% to $31,035 by April, overcoming the $30,000 resistance. It fluctuated around $30,000 until July, boosted by optimism and Bitcoin ETF applications from major firms. August saw a sharp drop from $29,000 to $26,000, partly due to SpaceX reportedly selling its Bitcoin. September experienced another dip, but Bitcoin held above $25,000. In October, it varied between $26,000 and $29,500, ending the month up 27.9%. November brought positive developments for [ccpw id=60415] and Ether ETFs, pushing Bitcoin above $37,000, but it faced resistance at $38,000. Early December saw it rise above $40,000, fueled by ETF speculation and potential Fed rate cuts. By January 2024, Bitcoin reached $45,000, its highest since 2022. However, following the SEC’s ETF approval, its price fell to $38,500. Bitcoin recently dipped below the critical $40,000 support level recently, signaling a strong selling trend among investors. However, the price faced a rebound after it touched a low near $38,500, suggesting strong accumulation. Currently, the price is trying to reclaim the $40K mark, but it is encountering considerable resistance at the 20-day exponential moving average and the descending resistance line. A rejection from this level could lead the BTC/USDT pair to drop below $38,000, potentially leading to a further decline towards the next major support at $36,300. Investors are likely to aggressively protect the price range between $34,000 and $38,000. For a bullish reversal, it’s crucial for the price to break above the 20-day EMA.

In the past 30 days, Bitcoin has experienced 14 green days out of 30 (47%), with a price volatility of 3.68%. Coincodex’s Bitcoin forecast advises that it is currently not an opportune time to purchase Bitcoin. Furthermore, considering the historical price trends and BTC halving cycles, Bitcoin’s predicted yearly low for 2025 is estimated to be $29,268. In contrast, the price of Bitcoin is anticipated to soar as high as $149,245 in the following year. ARKInvestanalyst Yassine Elmandjra projects that by 2030, Bitcoin’s value could surge to $1 million. This forecast hinges on the belief that Bitcoin, currently in its initial stage, will evolve to integrate numerous new applications in the coming years. Investing in Bitcoin involves balancing rewards and risks, which is crucial for informed decision-making. Analysts hold a positive outlook on Bitcoin’s future, especially post-2024. They point to favorable macroeconomic conditions, the anticipated halving, advancements in the Lightning network, and the adoption of the Bitcoin ETF as reasons for a bullish rally. Nonetheless, there are possible challenges, such as government scrutiny and political issues surrounding Bitcoin’s energy use, which could impact its long-term viability. Additionally, there are concerns about Bitcoin’s security due to a diminishing block reward. It is to be noted that if Bitcoin’s adoption doesn’t grow or if miners lack sufficient fee revenue to maintain the network, this could lead to decreased security and threats to the network’s stability. However, depending on our average prices for each year, Bitcoin can be a safe investment option in crypto and an investment at around $35K-$38K might turn profitable in the long run. Bitcoin stands as the largest cryptocurrency and often sets trends that other cryptocurrencies, regardless of size, tend to follow. Despite not having reached its November 2021 peak, Bitcoin remains dominant and has shown strong performance in recent months. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the traditionally crypto-skeptical SEC might signal a shift towards broader acceptance of BTC. Having led the cryptocurrency boom and retained its market leadership for over a decade, Bitcoin is poised to continue as the world’s leading cryptocurrency. For many around the globe, Bitcoin is synonymous with cryptocurrency. However, with increasing regulatory attention, caution is advised. The volatility of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, is well-documented, and it may be some time before BTC revisits its previous highs, with the possibility of experiencing further lows in the meantime. As with all crypto investments, thorough research is essential before deciding to invest in [ccpw id=60415]. The likelihood of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 by the end of 2024 is uncertain and subject to various factors including the halving event, regulatory changes, global economic conditions, and market sentiment. While some experts are optimistic due to factors like the anticipated Bitcoin halving and growing institutional adoption, according to our analysis, it might be impossible for Bitcoin to touch $100K in 2024. The Bitcoin Halving event, which halves the reward for mining new blocks, historically precedes significant price increases. This is partly because the reduced supply of new Bitcoins can lead to increased demand. For instance, after the 2016 and 2020 halvings, Bitcoin’s price surged significantly. However, past performance is not always indicative of future results, and other market factors also play a crucial role. Key factors influencing Bitcoin’s price in 2024 include the Bitcoin halving event, regulatory developments, global economic conditions, technological advancements (like improvements in the Lightning Network), and institutional adoption. Political and environmental considerations related to Bitcoin’s energy consumption also play a role. Market sentiment, influenced by these factors, is crucial in determining Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Whether Bitcoin is a good investment in 2024 depends on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and market understanding. While analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin’s future post-2024, potential investors should consider the risks, including market volatility and regulatory uncertainties. A strategic approach might involve buying at lower price levels, such as around $35K-$38K, but thorough research and financial advice should be sought before making any investment decisions.

    "news_title": "XRP Price Prediction",
    "news_content": "Table of Contents The cryptocurrency XRP, developed by Ripple, recently made headlines following adecisionby New York Judge Analisa Torres. On July 13, 2023, she determined that XRP is not considered a security when sold on cryptocurrency exchanges. This verdict concluded nearly three years of legal battles, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) achieving only a partial victory in its effort to classify XRP as a security. However, Judge Torres did rule that [ccpw id=60496] qualifies as a security when sold directly by Ripple Labs. Despite this, exchanges resumed listing XRP. The SEC’s subsequent appeal wasdismissedin October. This ruling may influence the SEC’s ongoing cases against the Binance and Coinbase exchanges. Nonetheless, the SEC continues to pursue legal action against the executives of Ripple, demanding the company disclose details of audits, sales of XRP to non-employees, and revenue from XRP sales post-lawsuit in 2020. Ripple managed to leverage a strong market at the end of 2023 but has faced challenges in 2024. Developments in November 2023, such as the upgrade of the Ripple Payments platform, a partnership with Georgia’s central bank for a digital currency project, and acceptance by the Dubai International Finance Centre, have sparked renewed interest in Ripple. However, despite bullish developments and Bitcoin’s surge above $50K,XRP priceis yet to reach milestones, triggering concerns among investors. In this article, we’ll exploreXRP price predictionand its future market potential with in-depth technical analysis to guide investors with a profitable investment plan. XRP operates on theXRP Ledger, a blockchain crafted by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, who later founded Ripple to utilize [ccpw id=60496] in facilitating transactions within its network. Investors can purchase XRP for various purposes: as an investment, to exchange for other cryptocurrencies, or to finance operations on the Ripple network. The XRP Ledger distinguishes itself from other cryptocurrencies by its unique approach to transaction verification. Unlike typical cryptocurrencies that allow any participant to verify transactions by solving complex problems, the XRP Ledger employs a consensus protocol. This protocol enables users to download validation software and choose from specific node lists for transaction verification, based on trustworthiness, thereby centralizing the process to a degree. Validators on the Ripple network synchronize their ledgers every three to five seconds, ensuring consistency and halting for discrepancies to maintain secure and efficient transaction validation. This method offers a significant advantage in speed and cost compared to other cryptocurrencies, such as [ccpw id=60415]. According to Lee, whileBitcointransactions can take minutes to hours with high fees, XRP transactions are confirmed within approximately four to five seconds at a substantially lower cost. While XRP and Ripple are often used interchangeably, it’s crucial to distinguish between the two. XRP is an open-source digital currency that operates independently, while Ripple is a tech company leveraging XRP for its efficient, reliable, and carbon-neutral payment solutions to ensure compliance for its clients. XRP functions on a decentralized, open-source blockchain called the XRP Ledger (XRPL), with transactions supported by the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP). Setting it apart from many cryptocurrencies, XRP was created through pre-mining, with a capped total supply of 100 billion tokens. The distribution of these tokens was executed in a structured manner: Initially, 80 billion XRP tokens were designated for Ripple. To manage the token’s availability, Ripple placed 55 billion of these tokens into an escrow account. The co-founders and the primary team were allotted the subsequent 20 billion XRP. The remainder of the XRP is scheduled for release at a rate of under 1 billion per month, adhering to a planned timeline of 55 months. XRP was conceived as a peer-to-peer trust network, emphasizing its role as a digital asset that surpasses many in terms of transaction speed, cost-effectiveness, and energy efficiency. Ripple highlights XRP’s capabilities to execute transactions in seconds and its low energy consumption compared to other digital currencies. Ripple has established collaborations with over 200 financial institutions, focusing on delivering seamless tools for executing cross-border payments without friction. Distinct from Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, the Ripple network employs a Unique Node List for the selection of validators to oversee its operations. The choice of validators from this list is made by Ripple itself, a process that does not involve financial rewards for validators, as seen in PoW or PoS systems. This approach raises concerns regarding centralization and the potential for validators to engage in collusion, either to introduce fraudulent transactions or to block certain transactions on the network. With the capability to handle 1,500 transactions per second (TPS), Ripple’s network boasts significantly higher throughput compared to Ethereum’s capacity of about 15 TPS. Ripple has expressed ambitions to reach or even surpass Visa’s processing speed of 65,000 TPS in the future. Ripple is bullish about winning in its legal battle against the SEC, a conflict that has seen significant developments throughout 2023. A trial is scheduled for April 2024, although the SEC might appeal any decision made. A pivotal moment came on July 13th when a judge ruled that Ripple Labs did not breach federal securities laws by selling XRP on public exchanges, leading to a 73% surge in XRP’s value that day. However, on August 17th, the SEC secured the right to a mid-trial appeal regarding this decision, a matter that remains unresolved. These developments have notably influenced XRP’s market value. Although the lawsuit primarily affects the U.S. market and its participants, its outcome is anticipated to have global repercussions, potentially shaping investor sentiments and regulatory frameworks worldwide. The prevailing belief is that Ripple will emerge victorious against the SEC. Such an outcome would uniquely position XRP as the only cryptocurrency to have judicially affirmed its status as not a security, potentially catalyzing a bullish market response. Conversely, an SEC victory could adversely affect XRP’s price in 2024, imposing a significant fine on Ripple. Nonetheless, the XRP blockchain’s open-source nature and the ability for anyone to operate a validating node ensure its continued functionality regardless of the lawsuit’s outcome. Another factor to consider is the anticipated crypto bull run in 2024, spurred by the Bitcoin Halving event. A favorable legal outcome for Ripple in this context could significantly enhance XRP’s market position. Founded in 2012 by Ripple Labs (originally known as OpenCoin before rebranding in 2013), XRP was developed to facilitate seamless, cross-border transactions with rapid settlements and minimal fees. CoinMarketCap data reveals that XRP debuted at $0.005875 in 2013. It experienced a notable surge in November 2013, reaching $0.05238, but subsequently fell, trading under $0.01 until the second quarter of 2017. At this point, the price dramatically increased to $0.3532. After a period of stabilization, XRP’s value skyrocketed to an all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 on January 4, 2018. This peak was followed by a downturn, with the price dipping to $0.1432 during a crypto bear market. December 2020 saw the SEC filing a lawsuit against Ripple for the sale of unregistered securities, which hindered XRP’s ability to reach a new ATH during the 2021 bull market, peaking at $1.9637. Post-April 2021, XRP exhibited a downtrend until September 2022, when it broke this pattern. The price then retested the trendline, subsequently rallying on positive developments, marking a series of higher lows and highs. 2023 showed some positive developments for XRP, starting with a value of approximately $0.504 on June 1. However, the landscape became challenging when the SEC initiated lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, impacting Ripple’s performance and leading to a decrease in XRP’s value to $0.4593 by June 16. The situation improved with a court ruling, propelling XRP to $0.8875 on July 13, before it fell again, reaching $0.4671 by September 11. The coin saw a recovery, boosted by the market’s positive response to the SEC’s appeal rejection, climbing to $0.7299 by November 6. It experienced a minor dip afterward, trading at $0.59 on November 17, and ended the year at $0.6149. Entering 2024, Ripple’s value further declined, with XRP standing at about $0.5 in June. XRP experienced a decline from the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) priced at $0.51, but it managed to find support at $0.47. In recent hours, buyers are attempting to validate a clear upward trend above immediate resistance channels; however, the price faces bearish correction around $0.5. As of writing, XRP price trades at $0.498, surging over 1.92% in the last 24 hours. The 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.50 is leveling off, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is slightly above the midpoint, indicating a slight edge for the bulls. To shift momentum in their favor, the bulls need to drive the price above the 50-day SMA. Conversely, if the price breaks and closes below the $0.46 support, it will indicate that the bears have gained the upper hand. Under this scenario, the XRP/USDT pair might drop to $0.41. The bulls are likely to put up a strong defense in the range from $0.46 to $0.41. While this legal battle between the SEC and Ripple primarily concerns the US markets and participants, its outcome will resonate globally among investors and regulatory frameworks. There is a belief that Ripple will win over the SEC in this lawsuit. Should this outcome materialize, XRP would stand as the only cryptocurrency to secure a court ruling affirming its non-security status, potentially leading to significant bullish sentiment for XRP. Conversely, there remains the possibility of the SEC winning the case, which could severely impact XRP’s price trajectory in 2024. Despite the distinction between the XRP blockchain and Ripple Labs, their interconnectedness typically means developments involving Ripple Labs influence XRP’s market trends. Stepping back to observe the broader cryptocurrency landscape, early 2024 appears to be witnessing a robust bull run, characterized by Bitcoin achieving new all-time highs and widespread meme-driven market enthusiasm. In 2024, XRP is expected to reach a minimum price of $0.6145. The maximum price could reach up to $0.7127, with an average price around $0.6395. Currently, XRP’s circulating supply amounts to only 54.74% of its maximum supply of 100 billion tokens. The remaining tokens are locked in smart contracts, with 1% (one billion tokens) being released monthly. At this rate, all tokens could be fully released into the market within 48 months. Ripple typically sells these tokens through over-the-counter (OTC) trading to mitigate direct impact on the XRP price. However, the ongoing release schedule raises concerns about potential future sell pressure. Additionally, there’s a hope for XRP ETF in the future, which might strengthen the buying interest for XRP price. XRP’s price in 2025 is forecasted to range from a minimum of $0.8768 to a maximum of $1.06, averaging around $0.9023. In 2026, XRP is predicted to trade between $1.24 and $1.52, with an average price of $1.29 based on detailed technical analysis. For 2027, XRP’s price is expected to range from $1.75 to $2.14, averaging approximately $1.80. In 2028, XRP could see prices ranging from $2.59 to $3.02, with an average trading price of $2.66. Looking ahead to 2029, XRP’s price is forecasted to range from $3.95 to $4.45, averaging around $4.06. By 2030, XRP’s price is anticipated to range from $5.74 to $6.85, with an average forecasted price of $5.90. In 2031, XRP’s price could range from $8.53 to $10.13, with an average forecasted price of $8.82. For 2032, XRP is expected to see prices ranging from $12.59 to $14.78, with an average price around $12.95. Looking further ahead to 2033, XRP’s price is predicted to range from $19.23 to $22.45, with an average trading price of approximately $19.75. According to Coincodex’s current XRP price prediction, the cryptocurrency is expected to experience a 20.74% increase, reaching $0.59645 by July 20, 2024. Technical indicators suggest a Bearish sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index stands at 60 (Greed). Over the past 30 days, XRP has seen 14 out of 30 days (47%) of positive price movement, with a volatility of 3.73%. Given the XRP forecast, the current analysis advises against purchasing XRP at this time. Looking ahead to 2025, based on historical price trends and BTC halving cycles, Coincodex predicts a yearly low for XRP around $0.31235, with a potential high reaching $1.548702 next year. According to Digital Coin Price, there is potential for XRP to surpass the $1.28 mark and stabilize in the market by the conclusion of 2025. The projected range for XRP’s lowest price is between $1.06 to $1.28, with the most likely price settling around $1.21 by the end of the year. Despite XRP’s volatility and concerns over its environmental impact, billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper maintains his forecast that XRP could reach $1.28 either by late 2025 or early 2026. Looking further ahead, beginning in 2030, XRP’s price is predicted to rise to $3.64 based on technical analysis. By the end of 2030, XRP could potentially reach up to $3.34. The years between 2024 and 2030 are expected to be pivotal for significant growth in XRP’s value. XRP is often cited as having one of the most solid and definitive use cases within the cryptocurrency sector. Yet, this advantage comes with a trade-off in terms of greater centralization. Furthermore, the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC adds a layer of risk, possibly making XRP a more precarious investment compared to other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, shouldRippleemerge victorious against the SEC and demonstrate that XRP does not constitute a security, this could lead to a surge in its adoption, possibly driving the price upwards. In summary, although XRP holds considerable promise, it’s important for investors to recognize the associated risks. However, it is advised to invest in XRP at a price of $0.47 for a profitable return in the long term. In a Bloomberg interview, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed enthusiasm for the idea of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) centered on the XRP token. On February 20, Garlinghouse revealed Ripple’s positive outlook toward the possibility of an XRP ETF, stating the company would “certainly welcome it.” He further anticipated the emergence of numerous ETFs focused on various tokens and mentioned the potential for ETFs that encompass a range of tokens, which, in his view, would help investors mitigate risks. Garlinghouse argued for the benefits of having a variety of ETFs, drawing parallels between the nascent stage of cryptocurrency-focused ETFs and the early development of the stock market, where diversification beyond a single stock was crucial for investors. While he declined to confirm whether Ripple was currently engaging with ETF issuers, he reiterated the company’s supportive stance on the development of an XRP ETF, emphasizing its alignment with the interests of the XRP community. Additionally, Garlinghouse shared his perspective on the broader significance of digital assets, emphasizing their utility and capacity to address real-world challenges. He acknowledged Bitcoin’s success as a store of value and positioned XRP as exceptionally suited for facilitating payments, underscoring Ripple’s long-term vision for digital assets’ role in solving practical problems. During the last bull market, XRP failed to break its previous all-time highs (ATHs) from 2018, primarily due to two factors: The first is the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC, which has caused many financial institutions to remain cautious and, on the sidelines, awaiting the outcome, similarly influencing investor sentiment. The second factor is the increased supply of XRP, which has led to price dilution. Looking forward, while an increase in circulating supply is expected, the outcome of the SEC lawsuit holds significant potential to influence XRP’s price trajectory. A loss for Ripple Labs could result in fines and negatively affect the Ripple blockchain’s operations. On the other hand, a win would provide regulatory clarity and could lead to increased institutional adoption, potentially driving the price significantly higher. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could also play a role in boosting XRP’s value, as banks might adopt [ccpw id=60496] as a bridge currency among various CBDCs. Retail investor sentiment is another crucial factor for XRP’s price. The “XRP Army,” a large and active online community, has been instrumental in driving XRP to its 2018 ATH, highlighting the influence of community support on the cryptocurrency’s value. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct good investment analysis by experts before investing in the volatile market. The case had a mixed outcome. New York Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold on exchanges but qualifies as one when sold directly by Ripple Labs. The XRP Ledger uses a consensus protocol for transaction verification, which is quicker and more cost-effective than the proof-of-work system used by Bitcoin. Ripple is a technology company that utilizes XRP in its network to facilitate transactions, while XRP is a digital currency that operates on the XRP Ledger. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, XRP uses a Unique Node List for validator selection, which has raised concerns about centralization. Ripple’s network can handle 1,500 transactions per second and aims to reach or surpass Visa’s processing speed in the future. As of the article’s publication, the price of XRP is expected to increase and potentially reach $0.720354 by March 2024, but the sentiment is currently bearish. Predictions suggest that XRP’s price could go as high as $1.694717 by 2025, with a potential to surpass the $1.41 mark by the end of 2025.

    "news_content": "Table of Contents Many people compare Solana, a new blockchain platform, to Ethereum because Ethereum is a leading platform for blockchain smart contracts. Ethereum is not just popular because it was the first of its kind. Its smart management made it the go-to place for many opportunities, especially for the initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017-18 and a lot of the popular meme coins in 2020-21. Ethereum has shown a successful way to do things by making it easier to start projects and by having a lot of developers working together, which makes people interested and helps increase its value. On the other hand, Solana has managed to follow Ethereum’s successful way in many areas, which is now seen in its range of new projects, meme coins, engaged community, and many active developers. Successful meme coins on Solana, like $BONK, which is said to have led to a quickly sold-out Solana phone, show that [ccpw id=60497] has managed to create some of the excitement that Ethereum did. This copying of Ethereum’s formula for success—making it easy to start projects and building a strong community—shows a positive future for Solana as it keeps making its place in the competitive world of blockchain. As SOL prices now charge ahead following the recent market recovery, investors are wondering how high Solana will climb. In this Solana price prediction, we’ll explore Solana’s future price potential and find out its worth by 2030 along with an in-depth technical analysis of the SOL price chart. Solana is a powerful blockchain network built for widespread use. It’s an open-source platform that supports different applications, like finance, digital collectibles (NFTs), payments, and video games. Solana was started in 2020 by a company called Solana Labs, which Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal created in 2018. Its own digital currency is called SOL. Solana works on a principle where every part of its network agrees on what’s happening, making it very secure against cheating and control attempts. The network uses a unique method called proof-of-history to process transactions very quickly and cheaply, handling up to 50,000 transactions every second. Solana has been growing quickly, with a vibrant community around it. It’s seen as one of the top blockchain networks for broad adoption, with several significant projects already using it. Solana’s main goal is to host smart contract applications, and it can do this more cheaply than Ethereum because it’s built to handle a lot of transactions without slowing down. This has made Solana a popular place for launching new projects, with some exciting Solana pre-sales happening right now. People often use Solana for buying and selling NFTs and using decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The Solana Foundation also has plans to bring stock trading onto its blockchain in the future. The [ccpw id=60497] coin is essential for running the Solana network. It’s used to pay for transaction fees and is also staked by validators who help keep the network secure. Similar to Ethereum, validators on Solana who don’t follow the rules can lose some of their staked coins. Solana stands out because of its Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus method. This system records timestamps that track who owned which cryptocurrency and when. This ensures that the transaction data is both precise and fair. Due to PoH, Solana includes various features like: The SOL cryptocurrency fuels Solana. Owners can stake their SOL, meaning they lock it in to gain voting rights within the network. Besides, SOL can be bought, sold, and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges. Solana’s whitepaperor technical guide suggests that it’s built to be faster and more user-friendly than other blockchain systems. However, a heads-up: the whitepaper is packed with technical terms. For example, it includes complex sentences such as “When used alongside a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoH can reduce messaging overhead in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant replicated state machine, resulting in sub-second finality times,” which might be puzzling for most people. Now, let’s take a look at some key moments in Solana’s price history. It’s important to remember that what happened in the past doesn’t always predict the future, but it can give us useful background information for understanding or making predictions about Solana’s price. Solana was created in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko and developed by Solana Labs. Initially, the SOL token was offered through private sales and presales, with its last presale in March 2020 at $0.22 per token. After being listed on exchanges, SOL’s price quickly rose, fluctuating between $0.50 and $1 until July 2020. In July, it surpassed $1 and continued to grow, hitting $10 by March 2021. Even after trading began on exchanges, Solana continued to attract significant investment from venture capitalists. In June 2021, Solana announced it had secured over $300 million in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital, with participation from Alameda Research. This influx of investment quickly propelled the Solana ecosystem, leading it to reach a peak price of $260.06 on November 6, 2021, just five months after the funding announcement. However, the concentration of SOL in the hands of venture capitalists and institutions eventually contributed to its downturn. After reaching its all-time high, SOL’s price fell as the broader crypto market entered a bear phase. A year after its peak, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance, decided to sell all his FTT tokens due to concerns about the financial stability of FTX exchange. This event is noteworthy for Solana because FTX and its affiliate, Alameda Research, were among the largest holders of [ccpw id=60497] at that time. CZ’s statement set off a chain of events that resulted in thedownfall of the FTX exchange. This situation forced FTX and Alameda Research to sell off their SOL tokens, driving down Solana’s price to a low of $8.42, a drop of 96.76% from its highest price. However, since the market crash, SOL price made a solid recovery and gained over 750% in the last 15 months. Solana price surged above $200 mark recently and is aiming to touch new ATH in the coming months. Solana fell below the crucial resistance of $160, indicating that the bears are trying to regain control. As a result, the price has been declining heavily below its immediate Fib lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. As of writing, SOL price trades at $151, declining over 1.6% in the last 24 hours. For the last three days, the bulls have successfully held the price above the $145 level, creating rebound opportunities. Yet they haven’t managed to lift the SOL/USDT pair beyond the 20-day EMA ($155). This situation heightens the possibility of a decline to $140, which is anticipated to act as robust support. A move and sustained close above $176 will mark the first sign of upward momentum. Should this occur, the bulls will attempt to push the price past the $192 resistance and take on the significant barrier at $205. The next crypto bull market is anticipated to kick off in 2024, a prediction reinforced by the market movements at the end of 2023. This expected surge could attract numerous new users to the cryptocurrency sector and rekindle interest among existing users in the now significantly advanced Solana ecosystem. Solana boasts a theoretical capacity of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), which results in substantially lower transaction fees compared to networks like Ethereum, which manages only 10-12 TPS. During a bull market, the demand for the Solana network could reach new heights, as witnessed in the previous bull run. This is particularly plausible given that Solana has managed to retain a large segment of its user base, despite the lackluster performance of its token, SOL. However, many SOL holders might be waiting to recoup their investments, which could create heightened selling pressure as prices rise. This scenario is likely if the blockchain does not manage to attract new demand beyond its existing user base. In 2024, Solana’s price is expected to stabilize at a minimum of $149.50. The peak price may reach up to $190.14, with the average price hovering around $175.71 throughout the year. Several factors will play a crucial role in determining whether Solana can emerge as one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in for the upcoming bull market. Solana boasts an impressive capability of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS). However, the Solana blockchain has experienced notable outages, often attributed to issues with its validators. A significant drawback of such high scalability is the expensive hardware required to operate a validator node, which contributes to Solana’s higher degree of centralization compared to Ethereum. Currently, Solana has 1,843 validators, in contrast to Ethereum, which is secured by over 1 million validators, boasting an average participation rate of approximately 99%. For the year 2025, the minimum price of Solana is anticipated to be $222.89. It could climb to a high of $264.43, maintaining an average price of $230.67 across the year. In 2026, the lowest price for Solana is forecasted to be $346.02. The price might ascend to a high of $393.50, with an average price of $355.24 for the year. Forecast and technical analysis suggest that in 2027, Solana’s price is expected to bottom out at $483.63 and may reach a high of $602.05, with an average trading price of $501.39. Based on thorough technical analysis of past price data, the price of Solana in 2028 is projected to reach a low of $724.96 and may surge to a high of $837.47, with an average price of $750.03. In 2029, it is expected that one Solana will have a minimum price of $1,052 and may reach up to $1,258, with the average throughout the year being around $1,090. Technical analysis indicates that in 2030, the price of Solana could start at a low of $1,571 and potentially escalate to a high of $1,846, with an average price of $1,615. The price of Solana in 2031 is anticipated to have a floor of $2,281 and may peak at $2,777, with an average price expected to be around $2,346. By 2032, the minimum price of Solana is forecasted to be $3,348, potentially reaching a maximum of $3,973, with the average price settling at $3,441. Deep technical analysis predicts that in 2033, the price of Solana will likely have a minimum value of $4,780 and could rise to a maximum of $5,833, with an average value of $4,952 throughout the year. According to the latest Solana price prediction by Coincodex, Solana is expected to rise by 15.92% and reach $172.78 by July 12, 2024. Technical indicators from Coincodex suggest a bearish current sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index indicates a level of 72, which signals Greed. Over the past 30 days, Solana has experienced 13/30 (43%) green days with a price volatility of 5.29%. Based on these forecasts, it is currently considered an unfavorable time to purchase Solana. Drawing on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Coincodex estimates that the lowest price for Solana in 2025 could be around $145.77, with a potential high reaching up to $436.75 the following year. Reflecting on Solana’s past price trends and Bitcoin’s halving cycles, it is estimated that the lowest price for Solana in 2025 could be around $145.77. Additionally, projections suggest that Solana’s price may climb to a peak of $436.75 in the following year. According to market analysts and experts cited by Digital Coin Price, SOL is expected to open the year 2026 at $444.65 and may trade around $535.81. This represents a significant increase from the previous year, marking a notable advance in Solana’s value. By the start of 2030, forecasts and technical analyses from Digital Coin Price suggest that Solana’s price will rise to $1,109.97, maintaining this level throughout the end of the year. Additionally, SOL could potentially reach as high as $1,017.33. The period from 2024 to 2030 is anticipated to be a pivotal phase for Solana’s growth. Solana stands out as a robust project, boasting an engaging use case and remarkable technology. The dedication of its community to support the coin, especially during challenging periods, is commendable. Although there is considerable potential for Solana’s growth, it is critical to stay cognizant of the associated risks. These include regulatory scrutiny from entities like the SEC and inherent technical vulnerabilities that could compromise the network’s performance under increased demand. However, it is advised to invest in Solana at a price of $130 for a profitable return in the long term. Historically, the interest of institutional investors and venture capitalists has significantly influenced Solana’s (SOL) price. However, a recent downturn has seen many large investors withdrawing from the market. The latest significant factor affecting SOL’s value is the legal action taken by the SEC against major platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and the Solana project itself. Should the SEC successfully argue that Solana constitutes a security, it could substantially depress SOL’s market value. Solana’s centralization and operational disruptions present additional risks. Persistent issues in these areas could hinder SOL’s potential for growth, as the blockchain may not meet its intended purposes. Conversely, resolving these concerns could dramatically expand Solana’s user base and significantly boost its price. Despite a 70% decrease from its all-time high, Solana maintains over 600,000 active wallets, indicating sustained demand and potential for future recovery. The broader cryptocurrency market’s trends also play a crucial role in SOL’s price trajectory. While Solana is likely to mirror the general market movements, the extent of this correlation will be influenced by the aforementioned factors. It’s important to look at the problems and trade-offs that came with Solana’s growth. When thinking about the big challenge of balancing scalability, security, and being decentralized in a blockchain network, Solana has chosen to focus on handling more than being decentralized. Even though Solana made choices that lessened its decentralization and sometimes its stability, these choices have mostly worked out for them. Analysts point out that these choices, while making it easier and cheaper for more people to use, basically rely on the idea that a main blockchain (Layer-1) is what the market needs. With the development of Layer-2 solutions on Ethereum, which address many issues Ethereum had with handling a lot of transactions and speed, it shows that maybe Layer-1 solutions like Solana aren’t the only way. Also, Ethereum’s successful switch to a Proof-of-Stake system, called ‘The Merge,’ shows it can overcome big challenges. There are questions about Solana’s ability to handle future challenges, especially when the trade-offs it made could be put to the test as the blockchain market changes. Several elements will influence if Solana emerges as a leading cryptocurrency for the upcoming market surge. Solana boasts an impressive capacity of 65,000 transactions per second (TPS). Yet, the network occasionally faces disruptions due to complications with its validators. A compromise of this enhanced scalability is the expensive hardware required for operating a validator node, leading to a greater degree of centralization compared to Ethereum. Solana presently supports 1,843 validators, in contrast to Ethereum’s network safeguarded by over 1 million validators, boasting an average participation rate of approximately 99%. The limited number of validators translates to fewer nodes upholding the network, which can result in service interruptions during peak usage or cyber-attacks. Addressing this challenge by either augmenting the validator count or boosting the efficiency of existing nodes is vital for Solana’s continued adoption and growth. Our Solana price prediction is bullish in the long term as the network continues to offer robust services to its users. However, it is advised to do your own research before investing in the volatile market. Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, DeFi, and more. It was launched in 2020 by Solana Labs, co-founded by Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal. Solana uses a unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism, which allows it to process up to 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain networks. Solana is often compared to Ethereum due to its support for smart contracts and dApps. However, Solana is faster and cheaper, with the ability to process more transactions per second (65,000 TPS compared to Ethereum’s 10-12 TPS). While Ethereum is more decentralized, Solana’s focus on scalability has led to greater centralization, with fewer validators securing the network. Solana (SOL) started trading on exchanges in 2020, initially priced around $0.50 to $1. By March 2021, it surpassed $10 and reached an all-time high of $260.06 in November 2021. However, following a broader market downturn and the collapse of FTX (a major holder of SOL), the price dropped to a low of $8.42. Since then, SOL has seen a recovery, surging above $200 in recent months. In 2024, Solana’s price is expected to range between $79 and $350, with an average price of $155.71. This forecast is based on the anticipated next crypto bull market, which could drive new users and increased demand for Solana’s ecosystem. While Solana has strong potential, a price target of $500 in 2024 would require significant growth. So $500 may be an ambitious target unless there is a major surge in market demand or new developments in the Solana ecosystem. Solana’s future looks promising, with predictions of continued growth through 2033. By 2030, Solana’s price could reach as high as $1,846, and by 2033, it could climb to $5,833. The success of Solana will depend on its ability to scale, maintain network stability, and attract new users and developers.  Shayan Chowdhury is a freelance writer and digital nomad.

    "news_title": "Pepe Coin Price Prediction: 2024, 2025, 2026 - 2030",
    "news_content": "Table of Contents The official Twitter handle for PEPE coin promotes it as the “most memeable memecoin ever,” humorously suggesting it’s time to move on from the dog-themed meme coin trend exemplified by the well-known Dogecoin.PEPElaunched on April 17 and initially received modest attention. It takes its inspiration from the Pepe the Frog meme, created byMatt Furiein 2005, which has been associated with various trends, including the alt-right movement. However, PEPE has no official connection with Furie or the original cartoon. Key aspects that highlight PEPE’s memecoin identity include its total circulation of 420 million tokens, referencing the cannabis culture’s 4/20 celebration. Analysts describe PEPE coin as a ‘meme takeover.’ For context, it tookDogecoin (DOGE)nearly four years to surpass a market cap of $1 billion. In a striking contrast, Pepe Coin reached this mark in just three weeks after its launch. Despite significant volatility in $PEPE’s price since then, the number of individual investors remains impressively high. The official website for Pepe Coin states that $PEPE has no intrinsic value and offers no financial guarantees. Nonetheless, it is notable that over a hundred thousand investors have bought $PEPE via Binance and other leading cryptocurrency exchanges. In this article, we’ll explore Pepe coin price prediction with in-depth technical analysis of the Pepe price to determine its future market potential and current trading sentiment. Meme coins have recently gained significant traction in the cryptocurrency space. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that emphasize practical applications, meme coins aim to capitalize on their viral potential, riding the wave of popular internet memes. Well-known examples include Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Floki Inu (FLOKI). The market is flooded with various meme tokens, making it challenging for investors to decide which meme coins are worth adding to their portfolios. Turning our attention to PEPE coin, it was introduced in April 2023 and quickly caught the eye of the crypto community. In a matter of weeks, PEPE’s market cap soared past $420 million, placing it among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. PEPE is available on prominent exchanges such as Huobi and OKX, as well as decentralized platforms like Uniswap. The official PEPE coin website describes it as “the most memeable meme coin in existence.” It’s crucial to understand that, like many meme coins, PEPE claims no intrinsic value and does not promise any financial returns. According to the creators of PEPE, the coin is purely for entertainment. This approach is not unprecedented in cryptocurrency, as many meme tokens have been created primarily for amusement, without inherent value or economic promise. While PEPE coin taps into the widespread appeal of memes, its developers clearly state that it has no connection to Pepe the Frog, the iconic meme created by Matt Furie. The primary aim of PEPE coin is to celebrate this popular meme within the crypto community. However, investors may still see potential for capital gains with PEPE, positioning it as an enticing, albeit speculative, meme token investment. PEPE coin emerged informally as a tribute to the well-known internet meme “PEPE the Frog,” which gained popularity in the early 2000s. The coin operates without a formal team or a structured development plan. Despite lacking traditional support, PEPE quickly climbed the ranks of cryptocurrencies, securing the 70th position on CoinMarketCap within just two weeks after its debut. PEPE began trading on April 15, 2023, starting at a price of about $0.000000001 per coin, and has since risen to $0.000001116 per coin. The official PEPE coin website openly admits, “PEPE is a meme coin without intrinsic value or expectations of financial returns. It lacks a formal team or a developmental roadmap, existing solely for entertainment.” Contrary to its declared purpose, PEPE aims to capitalize on the meme coin trend, much like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others, but stands out with its frog-themed motif as opposed to the canine themes of the others. PEPE Coin also incorporates a deflationary tactic, burning a small portion of tokens with each transaction to reduce supply and potentially increase the remaining tokens’ value over time. Moreover, PEPE employs a redistribution scheme where a fraction of each transaction is shared among existing token holders, designed to boost engagement and promote sustained investment in the coin. In August 2023, the Pepe Coin community was shocked when 16 trillion $PEPE tokens (worth around $15 million USD) were unexpectedly moved from the project’s multi-signature wallet to several centralized exchanges. Following media reports of the incident, the value of the meme coin dropped significantly. Community members expressed their worries about the future of $PEPE on various social media platforms. In response, a person responsible for handling the project’s official communications attempted to explain the sudden transfers, presumably to calm the community. However, this attempt backfired, increasing worries instead. The explanation provided pointed to unhappy developers within the Pepe Coin team who had managed to move the tokens from the multi-signature wallet, supposedly as part of an “update.” These developers had since left the project. The person overseeing the project’s communications openly accused these former developers of stealing and selling the tokens. Throughout September, the value of Pepe Coin continued to fall, despite assurances that the tokens in the multi-signature wallet were secure and under the care of someone dedicated to the community and the remaining $PEPE tokens. In October, a significant update was shared via the official Pepe Coin communications channel. A new advisory team was introduced to lead the project, and it was announced that 6.9 trillion $PEPE tokens, worth about $6 million, had been burned to reduce the total supply. This move to burn tokens, along with the introduction of a new advisory team, sent a reassuring signal to investors about the ongoing development and management of the project, leading to a rise in $PEPE’s price. The beginnings of the PEPE coin are somewhat enigmatic. Unlike typical cryptocurrencies, it didn’t use standard distribution methods such as an initial coin offering (ICO), presale, or airdrop. Its rise in popularity seems purely driven by the charm of the “PEPE the Frog” meme among potential investors. It’s critical to mention that PEPE coin has no official link to Matt Furie, the artist behind the original “PEPE the Frog” meme. The identities of PEPE coin’s founders remain unknown, with the only clear detail being its launch in mid-April 2023. Information about the team behind PEPE is limited. Despite this, the coin has quickly drawn a lot of attention on social media platforms like Twitter and Telegram, fostering a strong community around it. Pepe coin captured interest right after its quiet launch in mid-April, with the first significant transactions appearing on Etherscan on April 18. The coin’s value saw a dramatic rise initially, skyrocketing from $0.00000006036 to $0.0000004002 in just the first three days—a remarkable 563% increase. This explosive growth triggered conversations about Pepe’s potential as a leading meme coin. After a period of price adjustment and stabilization, Pepe’s value started a significant rally on April 30, climbing 214% in two days to hit a new high. Binance attributed this surge to substantial purchases by major investors. Pepe’s momentum persisted, reaching an impressive market cap of $1.8 billion and a peak price of $0.000004354. This high coincided with Binance’s announcement on May 5 about listing Pepe. However, the climb was not to last, as early investors began to cash out, causing a downturn in the price. After reaching its peak, Pepe saw reduced volatility, with less trading activity. On August 24th and 25th, 2023, the token faced a significant sell-off, losing nearly 27% of its value. According to a report from Pepe’s official communication channels, this drop was caused by a team member who misappropriated and sold off funds from the Pepe multi-signature wallet. Over the next few months, as the crypto market surged from its bearish channels, Pepe price witnessed a skyrocketing push. As a result, it touched a new ATH in March followingBitcoin’snew all-time high. Pepe has been trading within a narrow symmetrical triangle pattern for the past few days, indicating an equilibrium between buyers and sellers at these price levels. Nonetheless, buyers are attempting to drive the price above this pattern to establish a clear uptrend. Currently, the price of Pepe is $0.000012, declining over 2.5% in the last 24 hours. The 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) is on a downward trajectory, currently at $0.00001235, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending toward a fall below the oversold region, suggesting that sellers have the upper hand. They might push the PEPE/USDT pair towards the critical support level at $0.0000113, a point which could stimulate selling interest. Falling below this level might cause a further drop to $0.000008. On the upside, the key resistance level to watch is the triangle’s downtrend line. A breakthrough by buyers could potentially push the pair to $0.000017 and may even reach up to $0.00002. Looking at the Pepe roadmap reveals a lack of clear direction for its future beyond a vague anticipation of $PEPE and meme coins dominating. Consequently, the project appears to lack obvious next steps, despite its substantial community, boasting over 650K Twitter followers, which could cap its potential price growth. However, meme coins are renowned for their potential to generate substantial wealth, as their prices can skyrocket swiftly when supported by strong community engagement. As demonstrated by its 222% surge to an all-time high following the Binance exchange listing, a significant announcement in 2024 could once again propel Pepe to new heights. According to the forecast and technical analysis, the price of Pepe in 2024 is expected to achieve a minimum value of $0.0021. The maximum anticipated price for PEPE is $0.0025, with an average projected at $0.0022. Pepe coin has only 13% of the holders that Shiba Inu does, and 4.1% of the holders that Dogecoin does. Pepe also commands approximately 15% of the followers of each, and represents 20% of the market cap of $SHIB and just 15.6% of the market cap of $DOGE. Given these metrics, Pepe could be considered undervalued and potentially poised for growth leading up to 2025. However, for Pepe to attain a valuation similar to Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, it must demonstrate its value proposition. For instance, Shiba Inu is rolling out Shibarium, anEthereumlayer two scaling solution, alongside various other protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is developing tools and libraries to facilitate seamless integration of $DOGE as a payment method for businesses. In 2025, the price of Pepe is predicted to start at a minimum of $0.0031 and could rise to a maximum of $0.0037, averaging $0.0033 throughout the year. For 2026, Pepe’s price is forecasted to range from a low of $0.0046 to a high of $0.0057, with an average trading price of $0.0048. In 2027, based on deep technical analysis of past price data, Pepe is forecasted to range from a minimum of $0.0065 to a maximum of $0.0079, with an average trading value of $0.0067. The price of Pepe in 2028 is predicted to vary between $0.0096 and $0.0113, with an average price of $0.0100. By 2029, the price of Pepe is forecasted to range from a low of $0.0144 to a high of $0.0172, with an average forecast price of $0.0148. In 2030, Pepe’s price is expected to range from a minimum of $0.0207 to a maximum of $0.0249, averaging $0.0215. For 2031, Pepe’s price is forecasted to range from $0.0319 to $0.0375, with an average forecast price of $0.0327. In 2032, the price of Pepe is expected to range from $0.0458 to $0.0567, with an average price of $0.0471. In 2033, Pepe’s price is predicted to range from $0.0674 to $0.0807, averaging $0.0698 based on forecasted prices and technical analysis. According to Coincodex’s current Pepe Coin price prediction, the coin is expected to see a significant increase of 227.44%, reaching $0.00003859 by July 14, 2024. Coincodex’s technical indicators suggest a Bearish sentiment currently, with the Fear & Greed Index showing 74 (Greed). Over the last 30 days, Pepe Coin has experienced 12 out of 30 (40%) green days and a price volatility of 15.22%. Based on this forecast, Coincodex advises against buying Pepe Coin at this time. Looking ahead to 2025, based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Coincodex estimates a yearly low for Pepe Coin at $0.00001179. Additionally, the forecast predicts that Pepe Coin could reach as high as $0.00005557 next year. According to Digital Coin Price’s analysis, by 2026, market analysts and experts project that PEPE will commence the year at $0.0000356 and trade within the range of $0.0000356 to $0.0000438. This forecast represents a substantial increase compared to previous years. Looking further ahead, by the beginning of 2030, their Pepe Price Prediction and technical analysis foresee a rise to $0.0000885 early in the year, with potential for PEPE to reach as high as $0.0000816 during the period. The years between 2024 and 2030 are anticipated to be pivotal for Pepe’s growth trajectory. Traders have been asking “is pepe a good investment?” as the hype surrounding Pepe has dropped steeply. Pepe, a meme coin with a loyal following, has experienced a decline in popularity as investors turn their attention to utility tokens. However, market dynamics are cyclical, with liquidity often shifting among different investment types. The meme coin community is keeping an eye on potential developments such as new exchange listings and improvements in the ecosystem that could enhance Pepe’s value and reignite long-term interest. At its height, Pepe reached a market cap of $4.2 billion, but it currently holds a valuation of $2 billion, despite its lack of inherent utility. This speculative aspect makes it a high-risk investment. Pepe Coin’s rapid expansion has also spurred the creation of various offshoots, drawing investors who are either looking for alternatives or aiming to capitalize on these new coins from the outset, similar to the initial surge of interest in Pepe. As a result, investor focus has now increased on other meme coins includingBonk. According to our analysis, meme coins can’t be a good investment in the long run as their values entirely depend on community demand and sentiment. However, Pepe can be a good investment for a short-term profitable return. The frog-themed meme coin PEPE, which is quickly becoming a favorite in the crypto world, has proven to be very profitable for those who got in early. It has even outpaced well-known meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, drawing both criticism and a dedicated following. This popularity boost is clear from its growing number of holders, increased trading activity, and a bigger presence on social media, which fuels discussions about its potential expansion. Yet, the foundation of PEPE is not very strong or valuable, a common issue with meme coins, raising questions about how long its success can last. Its future, like that of many meme coins, is uncertain and highly unpredictable in the ever-changing crypto market. The crypto sector has seen its share of surprising success stories with meme coins, but only a few, like DOGE and SHIB, have held their value in tough times and turned out to be good investments. PEPE might be starting to make a name for itself as another notable example in this pattern, but it’s still too soon to say whether meme coins will have lasting value. It is advised to do your own research and conduct in-depth analysis before investing in the volatile market. Pepe Coin (PEPE) is a meme-based cryptocurrency that launched in April 2023, inspired by the popular “Pepe the Frog” meme. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus on functionality, Pepe Coin aims to capitalize on internet meme culture. It has gained popularity due to its viral potential and strong community support. Pepe Coin operates as a meme token with no intrinsic value, formal team, or developmental roadmap. It uses a deflationary tactic, burning a small portion of tokens with each transaction to reduce supply. Additionally, a fraction of each transaction is redistributed to existing token holders, encouraging sustained investment. Pepe Coin launched in mid-April 2023 at around $0.000000001 per coin. It quickly gained traction, reaching a peak price of $0.000004354 in early May, following its listing on Binance. However, it has experienced significant volatility, including a steep sell-off in August 2023, after a developer mishandled funds. Despite these challenges, the coin saw a resurgence in early 2024, driven by broader market movements. In August 2023, Pepe Coin faced a major controversy when 16 trillion $PEPE tokens were unexpectedly moved from the project’s wallet to centralized exchanges. This event caused a significant drop in the coin’s value and raised concerns within the community. However, in response, the project burned 6.9 trillion tokens and introduced a new advisory team to rebuild trust. In 2025, Pepe Coin’s price is forecasted to range from a low of $0.0031 to a high of $0.0037, with an average price of $0.0033. The coin may gain value as it attracts more holders, though it will need to demonstrate a clear value proposition to rival other meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Pepe Coin’s price is influenced by community sentiment, social media engagement, and broader market trends. Major announcements, such as new exchange listings or developments in the ecosystem, can lead to significant price fluctuations. However, the coin’s speculative nature makes it a high-risk investment. The long-term outlook for Pepe Coin is uncertain, as it depends on maintaining community interest and navigating the volatile meme coin market. While it has shown the potential for rapid growth, its future success will likely hinge on its ability to differentiate itself from other meme tokens and maintain relevance.

    "news_title": "Bitgert Price Prediction",
    "news_content": "Table of Contents During the tumult of theFTX collapse, the divisive blockchain initiative Bitgert was in the spotlight, attracting investors through its audacious assertions of a rapid and cost-free blockchain. Bitgert, a crypto-engineering firm, has created a range of blockchain-powered products in sectors such as decentralized finance, NFTs, and the metaverse. This entity asserts that its mission is to leverage blockchain technology for innovation and problem-solving, aiming to enhance the living standards of its users.  In February 2022, Bitgert marked a significant achievement by launching its own blockchain, known as theBrise Chain. This blockchain is distinctive for its use of a “proof of authority” (PoA) consensus mechanism, enabling it to process up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). This processing speed positions the Brise Chain among the fastest in the industry, competing closely with chains like Aptos, which boasts a capability of 160,000 TPS. While Bitgert is advertised as a blockchain offering “zero gas fees,” in practice, users do incur nominal transaction fees, which are just fractions of a cent. Moreover, Bitgert Chain’s compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) significantly boosts its attractiveness by allowing seamless migration of projects fromEthereumor other EVM-compatible blockchains. In this article, we’ll exploreBitgert price predictionwith in-depth technical analysis of the BRISE token and determine its future price potential. Bitgert is a crypto engineering organization leveraging theBinance Smart Chain(BSC) to offer blockchain-based audit and product solutions globally. To support this mission, Bitgert has developed the Brise Chain, a high-speed blockchain network. The Brise Chain stands as Bitgert’s proprietary blockchain, notable for its zero gas fees and the capacity to process up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). Bitgert operates on the Brise Chain, utilizing a proof-of-authority (PoA) model to achieve rapid block generation times and minimal fees. This blockchain is designed to support smart contracts and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it easy for developers to port applications from Ethereum. With EVM compatibility, the Brise Chain launched with support for a wide range of Ethereum tools and decentralized applications (dApps), facilitating a smooth transition for developers. The Bitgert ecosystem includes several key components, such as the Knit Finance decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, the Miidas NFT Marketplace for non-fungible tokens, and the SPYNX Labs decentralized exchange (DEX). BRISE, the ecosystem’s native token, functions through smart contracts, allowing for seamless exchange and swapping with Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens and Binance’s BEP-20 tokens. Bitgert is driven by its proprietary BRISE Chain, which is based on a proof-of-authority (PoA) model to facilitate fast block processing and maintain low transaction costs. Its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a key aspect, supporting smart contracts and broadening the blockchain’s capabilities. Due to the design that welcomes EVM compatibility, Bitgert effortlessly incorporates a variety of Ethereum’s tools and decentralized applications (dApps), easing the transition for developers from the Ethereum ecosystem. The Bitgert ecosystem boasts a range of significant features, including the Knit Finance DeFi protocol, the Miidas NFT Marketplace for trading non-fungible tokens, and the SPYNX Labs decentralized exchange. At the core of the ecosystem is the BRISE token, which is integral to its operation through the use of smart contracts. BRISE is a versatile token, facilitating exchanges with ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum and BEP-20 tokens from Binance. Within the Bitgert ecosystem, BRISE plays several vital roles: it’s used to pay for gas fees during smart contract operations, enables staking, facilitates peer-to-peer payments, and collects transaction fees on the network. The multifunctionality of BRISE underscores its value in the Bitgert ecosystem, providing a comprehensive and dynamic platform for cryptocurrency activities. While it’s crucial to remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future outcomes, examining bitgert’s price history provides valuable context for either interpreting a bitgert price forecast or formulating one ourselves. When bitgert initially entered the open market in July 2021, its value hovered around $0.000000003564. It later surged to its peak of $0.00000404 on August 13, 2021, before experiencing a subsequent decline, closing the year at $0.0000003399. Despite the overall crypto market downturn, 2022 proved relatively positive for bitgert. On March 7, it soared to $0.000001849, but amid market turbulence, it plummeted to $0.0000002634 on June 18. Following some recovery, the announcement on September 26 of the coin’s listing on the Huobi exchange sent it to $0.000000677 the next day. However, November brought challenges with the collapse of the FTX (FTT) exchange, causing bitgert to hit a low of $0.0000003092 on November 21. The launch of the Bitgert Exchange in December boosted its value to $0.0000004515 on December 7, ending the year at $0.0000003019. Despite an approximate 11% annual loss, bitgert outperformed many other cryptocurrencies as the overall market plummeted by over 60%. In 2023, while the crypto market saw encouraging trends, bitgert’s performance was more mixed. It peaked at $0.0000006817 on February 26 before retracting to around $0.0000004635 on April 6. The price of BRISE continued to decline in the following months and touched the low of $0.00000012 in October. In recent weeks, the price of Bitgert has surged and touched the high of $0.00000037. Buyers’ repeated failures to lift the price above $0.00000017 might have prompted short-term traders to abandon their positions, causing the price to fall below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.000000142. As of writing, BRISE price trades at $0.000000138, declining over 2.9% in the last 24 hours. The 20-day EMA has been declining, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now near the oversold region, indicating an advantage for sellers. Should the price drop below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.00000012, this could tip the scales in favor of the sellers, potentially triggering a further drop to $0.00000008, and eventually down to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.000000065. On the flip side, a bounce from the current level above the 20-day EMA could mean that the BRISE/USDT trading pair may continue to trade sideways. For an upward trend to begin, bulls must drive the price past the resistance zone from $0.000000165 to $0.0000002, targeting $0.00000025. Bitgert Price Prediction By Blockchain Reporter With Bitgert Startup Studio, developers and entrepreneurs can create their own tokens on the BRISE Chain. This feature allows them to raise funds through private or public token sales, enabling innovative projects to secure the capital they need for development. The studio also offers marketing and technical support, ensuring the successful launch of these projects. In 2024, the price of Bitgert is anticipated to reach a minimum level of $0.00000021. The maximum expected price is $0.00000024, with an average price of $0.00000021 throughout the year. Bitgert has implemented a buyback concept to increase the attractiveness of holding BRISE. Each transaction incurs a 5% buyback tax, with a portion of these funds used to purchase tokens from the liquidity pool. The bought-back tokens are then burned, reducing the token supply and potentially increasing its value. For 2025, the price of Bitgert is expected to reach a minimum value of $0.00000030.

According to Coincodex, the current Bitgert price prediction indicates a rise of 225.69%, reaching $0.0000004535 by July 17, 2024. Technical indicators suggest a bearish sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index shows a level of 71 (Greed). Bitgert recorded 12 out of 30 (40%) green days with a 6.66% price volatility over the past 30 days. Based on the Bitgert forecast, it is currently considered a bad time to buy Bitgert. Analyzing historical price movements andBTChalving cycles, the yearly low Bitgert price prediction for 2025 is estimated at $0.0000001393, while the price could reach as high as $0.0000006526 next year. According to Digital Coin Price, by 2026, market analysts and experts predict that BRISE will start the year at $0.000000409 and trade around $0.000000501. This would represent a significant increase compared to the previous year, marking a notable jump in Bitgert’s value. By 2033, Bitgert is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.00000260, with a potential maximum of $0.00000270 and an average forecast price of $0.00000268. It may surpass its previous high and advance to the next level if conditions remain favorable. However, there is also a possibility of a decline. Determining the investment potential of Bitgert or its token BRISE is challenging. As of May 12, 2023, BRISE’s price is extremely low, recorded at $0.0000002119. With a maximum token supply of one quadrillion and a diluted market cap of $83 million, the project’s valuation would need to surge by another $83 million for BRISE’s price to merely double. BRISE has experienced a peak price of $0.000004 in the past, indicating that an increase from its present value is conceivable. The project effectively leverages marketing strategies, enticing investors with its low price and ambitious assertions. Nonetheless, given its scant user base and dubious credibility, the prospect of a significant appreciation in its value appears slim. However, it is suggested to invest in this token at a price of $0.00000015 for a profitable return in the long-term. Developers have the opportunity to utilize smart contracts for building and deploying decentralized apps on the BRISE Chain. This platform is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), ensuring that it can run Ethereum-based apps without any issues, promoting easy integration. The initiation of the Bitgert Startup Studio has spurred the development of numerous projects on the BRISE Chain. It provides developers and entrepreneurs with tools to create their own cryptocurrencies, secure funding through token sales, and access both marketing and technical assistance for their startups. To enhance the desirability of owning BRISE, Bitgert has adopted a buyback strategy. Every transaction triggers a 5% tax dedicated to buybacks, with some of these funds used to repurchase tokens from the liquidity pool. These tokens are subsequently destroyed, decreasing the overall token supply and potentially raising its market value. TheBitgert projecthas stirred significant online debate and skepticism, with many focusing on the anonymity of its creators, the thoroughness of its audits, the extent of its decentralization, and the veracity of its charitable claims. It boasts of offering minimal transaction fees and a capability of processing up to 100,000 transactions per second, claims that have skeptics and investors alike questioning the project’s legitimacy. The primary concern revolves around why, if the blockchain’s touted features are legitimate, it hasn’t become a staple among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The Bitgert team asserts that their blockchain architecture has effectively navigated the blockchain trilemma—the challenge of balancing scalability, decentralization, and security, where enhancing one aspect traditionally compromises another. Despite claims of achieving a decentralized and secure network, evidence or detailed information supporting these claims is elusive. Should the Bitgert blockchain have genuinely addressed the blockchain trilemma, it would represent a groundbreaking achievement in the field, potentially attracting widespread acclaim and interest for its advanced technology. Bitgert price has been down by over 50% in the last 12 months and it failed to show any promising recovery signs, Hence, it is advised to do your own research before investing in the volatile market. Experts believe that the Bitgert price prediction for 2024 might see BRISE touching significant highs. Given its blockchain’s efficiency and speed, a bullish trend might boost Bitgert’s price closer to the $1 mark, reflecting its growing adoption and technological advancements. Bitgert’s blockchain, known for its high transaction speed of up to 100,000 TPS and nominal transaction fees, sets a benchmark in the blockchain space. The integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) further enhances its appeal, offering vast interoperability within the crypto ecosystem. BRISE, as the native token of Bitgert, fuels transactions within the ecosystem, enabling operations on its fast and cost-effective blockchain. Its multifaceted utility across DeFi protocols, dApps, and as a medium for transaction fees solidifies its central role. 2024 Bitgert Price Forecast: 2025 to 2033 Bitgert Price Predictions: Shayan Chowdhury is a freelance writer and digital nomad.

    "news_title": "Luna Classic Price Prediction",
    "news_content": "Table of Contents Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) is a cryptocurrency that originated from the old Terra chain, which is now called Terra Classic. This digital coin was launched on May 28, 2022, following a planned fork that marked an important step in creating the new chain. Previously known as LUNA, the system that maintained the stability of Terra Classic’s stablecoin, TerraClassicUSD (USTC), is no longer functional. This is because all the related minting and burning activities have been halted. In this article, we’ll explore the current LUNC price sentiment with a view of its future market potential from Terraluna classic price prediction. The Terra Classic blockchain was initially created to support the TerraUSD (UST) cryptocurrency. The concept was that Terra’s LUNA cryptocurrency would keep UST tied to the US Dollar. When UST’s value rose above its peg, more LUNA was created, and when it fell below $1, LUNA was burned or destroyed. This system worked well initially, with LUNA reaching a market cap in the billions and ranking among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies. However, in May 2022, everything changed. UST lost its peg, and LUNA’s value plummeted, causing a significant downturn in the entire crypto market. It can be argued that the market has not fully recovered since. A new blockchain was established with a new version of the LUNA cryptocurrency, which took the LUNA name. The original blockchain, now called Terra Classic, continues to support the original cryptocurrency, now called LUNC, and is managed by the Terra Classic community. It’s important to note that Do Kwon, the founder, has been arrested by United States authorities and charged with eight offenses, including securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy. He is also imprisoned in Montenegro for forging official documents. As of now, Kwon faces extradition from Montenegro, but it is still unclear whether it will be to the United States or South Korea. Terra Classic operates as a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, where transaction validators are chosen based on the amount of LUNC they hold. LUNC backs the USTC stablecoin, with all burning and minting decisions made by the Terra Classic community. Additionally, LUNC can be bought, sold, and traded on various exchanges. In its technical documentation, orwhitepaper, Terra Classic claims to enable people to create and support their own stablecoins. It says: “The Terra protocol is the leading decentralized and open-source public blockchain protocol for algorithmic stablecoins. Using a combination of open market arbitrage incentives and decentralized Oracle voting, the Terra protocol creates stablecoins that consistently track the price of any fiat currency.” “Users can spend, save, trade, or exchange Terra stablecoins instantly, all on the Terra blockchain. Luna provides its holders with staking rewards and governance power. The Terra ecosystem is a quickly expanding network of decentralized applications, creating a stable demand for Terra and increasing the price of Luna.” After Terra’s collapse, Do Kwon proposed the Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan 2 on Terra’s developer forum. The new Terra 2.0 blockchain introduced a native token named LUNA, while the original Terra blockchain was rebranded as Terra Classic, with its native token renamed to Luna Classic (LUNC). Both LUNA and LUNC serve as the main staking tokens for their respective blockchains, giving stakeholders significant influence in governance. The key difference between LUNC and LUNA is LUNC’s burn mechanism. Originally, LUNC had a supply of 7 trillion tokens, which has been significantly reduced to 6.82 trillion due to this mechanism. This burn process plays a crucial role in managing the token supply. The new Terra blockchain, called Terra 2.0, made a major shift by excluding algorithmic stablecoins from its ecosystem. The holders of the redesigned LUNA tokens, now known as Luna Classic, included those who previously held, staked, and developed apps on Terra Luna Classic, as well as the remaining UST holders. As part of the plan to revive the Terra blockchain, the team introduced a token-burning mechanism for LUNC tokens in September 2022. This mechanism has burned millions of LUNC tokens to reduce the inflated supply and increase their value. In contrast, the LUNA cryptocurrency does not have a token-burning mechanism. The Terra Luna Classic project implemented a 1.2% burn tax on all on-chain Luna Classic (LUNC) transactions. Leading crypto exchange Binance also supported Terra’s efforts by converting the trading fees from LUNC/BUSD and LUNC/USDT trading pairs into LUNC tokens and burning them. While past performance isn’t a guarantee of future results, understanding LUNC’s price history can help provide context for interpreting or making a Terra Classic price prediction. We’ll focus on LUNC since May 2022, but it’s useful to highlight its earlier days. When Terra launched in July 2019, it was valued at about $1.30. This proved to be an overestimate, and the price dropped below a dollar, remaining there until early 2021. In January 2021, the token surpassed $1 and reached a high of $22.33 on March 21. After a decline in the following months, the price surged later in the year, hitting $103.33 on December 27. In early 2022, what was then known as LUNA saw significant price action, reaching a record high of $119.18 on April 5. Following a crash, it plummeted to a low of $0.00001675 on May 13. On May 28, the day the new LUNA emerged and the old one became LUNC, the coin closed at $0.00009566. When the Celsius crypto-lending platform halted withdrawals, confirming the bear market, LUNC dropped to $0.0000517 on June 18. By late August, the price climbed, closing the month at $0.0002252. The announcement of a 1.2% tax on blockchain transactions saw Terra Classic peak at $0.0005888 on September 8, 2022. The tax proposal passed on September 21, but LUNC’s price fell to around $0.000185 on the morning of September 26. By midday that day, after news of South Korean authorities contacting Interpol about Kwon and Binance implementing a 1.2% burn on LUNC trades, the price surged, with LUNC trading at around $0.00031. On October 2, 2022, it peaked at $0.0003613, before settling to about $0.00029 on October 12. Following thecollapse of the FTX exchange, LUNC fell to a low of $0.000148 on November 22 but rebounded to $0.0001658 on November 30. On December 1, news broke that Binance had burned more than six billion LUNC, significantly boosting the price, and by December 2, 2022, it was worth $0.0001805. 2023 was an average year for Terra Classic, despite a late-year surge. After surpassing $0.0002 in early February, the price fell again. The announcement of LUNC 2.0 in early June caused a brief rally to $0.0001, but negative events soon followed. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced lawsuits against the Binance and Coinbase exchanges, leading to a drop in LUNC’s price. The decline worsened in mid-August when the market reacted to Elon Musk’s SpaceX selling millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC). By September 25, LUNC was worth around $0.00006. In November, the price rose significantly, coinciding with news of Kwon’s extradition. On November 27, it reached $0.0001256, and on December 4, it peaked at $0.000275 before falling back to $0.0001386 by year-end, marking an annual loss of over 4%. The decline continued into the new year, with LUNC valued at about $0.0001025 on January 22. It decreased further in February but saw a notable rise in March, reaching $0.0001953 on March 8, 2024. In the following weeks, the price declined and it touched $0.00009 in April. The price in October dropped even more, to $0.00008661. LUNC price experienced a solid rejection from the 20-day EMA ($0.000106), resulting in a drop below its immediate Fib channels. However, bulls are trying to defend the price decline, aiming for a rebound above the immediate support line. As of writing, LUNC price trades at $0.0001043, declining over 3.4% in the last 24 hours. The daily LUNC/USDT chart, provided by TradingView, shows that if the bears push the price below the $0.00008654, it indicates that the LUNC/USDT pair might continue to oscillate within the broad range of $0.000082 to $0.000069 for some time. Conversely, a strong surge from the 20-day EMA would demonstrate the bulls’ strong buying pressure. Such a move could enhance the chances of revisiting the upper resistance at $0.00009102. Surpassing this resistance might set the stage for the pair to advance towards $0.000102. The Terra Classic DAO recently approved a proposal for a quant team to explore the possibility of repegging theTerraalgorithmic stablecoin, now rebranded as USTC. This initiative aims to restore confidence in the Terra Classic ecosystem. If successful, repegging USTC could significantly boost trust among crypto enthusiasts. However, if the quant team determines that repegging is unfeasible, it might lead to a decline in optimism within theTerra Classic community. Despite these uncertainties, the Terra Classic ecosystem continues to thrive with various ongoing developments. The project maintains a strong market cap and a dedicated, active community. In 2024, the price of Terra Classic is expected to drop to a minimum of $0.000139. Based on the analysis, the highest potential price for LUNC could be $0.000156, with an average price forecasted to be around $0.000143. The future of Terra Classic is uncertain. Its troubled past and the recent Terraport Finance hack have created adoption challenges. Despite this, the community remains strong, and developers continue to innovate. A core developer recently proposed a community-owned decentralized wallet in response to privacy concerns with Ledger and Metamask. With a rapidly decreasing supply, Terra Classic might become a valuable utility token. However, fierce competition in the layer one blockchain space may limit its gains. For 2025, Terra Classic’s price is anticipated to reach at least $0.000195. The maximum predicted price is $0.000239, while the average trading price is estimated at $0.000202. The forecast for Terra Classic in 2026 suggests a minimum price of $0.000294. The price could rise to a maximum of $0.000338, with an average trading price of $0.000302. By 2027, Terra Classic’s price is predicted to be no lower than $0.000432. The highest possible price is forecasted at $0.000509, with an average price around $0.000447. In 2028, technical analysis indicates that Terra Classic’s price could fall to $0.000638 at its lowest. The maximum price is projected to be $0.000754, with an average trading price of $0.000656. For 2029, Terra Classic’s price is forecasted to reach a minimum of $0.000890. The highest potential price is $0.0011, while the average price is expected to be around $0.000917. In 2030, the price of Terra Classic is anticipated to be at least $0.0013. The maximum price could reach $0.0016, with an average price of $0.0013 throughout the year. By 2031, Terra Classic’s price is expected to be around a minimum of $0.0019. The highest forecasted price is $0.0023, with an average trading value of $0.0019. The price prediction for Terra Classic in 2032 suggests a minimum of $0.0027. The maximum projected price is $0.0033, with an average trading price of $0.0028. In 2033, Terra Classic’s price is expected to reach a minimum value of $0.0040. The highest potential price is $0.0048, with an average forecasted value of $0.0041. According to Coincodex, the price of Terra Classic is expected to increase by 11.03%, reaching $0.000120 by June 18, 2024. Technical indicators currently show a bearish sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index indicates a greed level of 72. Over the past 30 days, Terra Classic experienced 17 out of 30 green days (57%) with a price volatility of 3.19%. Based on the Terra Classic forecast, now is considered a bad time to purchase Terra Classic. Analyzing historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, the predicted yearly low for Terra Classic in 2025 is $0.00009291. On the other hand, the price could rise to $0.000285 next year. By 2026, market analysts and experts at Digital Coin Price forecast that LUNC will commence the year at $0.000315 and trade around $0.000390. This projection suggests a substantial increase compared to the previous year, marking a notable jump for Terra Classic. By early 2030, predictions and technical analysis from Digital Coin Price indicate that Terra Classic’s price will reach $0.000773, maintaining this value by the year’s end. Additionally, LUNC could potentially achieve a price of up to $0.000721. The period from 2024 to 2030 is expected to be significant for Terra Classic’s growth. Terra Classic is a unique cryptocurrency that emerged from the original LUNA currency, which was essentially abandoned by its creators after thecollapse of the UST stablecoin. Although its current performance doesn’t match its previous highs, it still maintains an active community of supporters. However, Terra Classic is associated with one of the most significant crashes in crypto history. The future of the community’s efforts to rebrand and attract new investors remains uncertain. Additionally, the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings of Terraform Labs add a considerable layer of uncertainty to Terra Classic’s prospects. As always, thorough research is essential before considering an investment in LUNC. However, it is advised to invest in LUNC price at a price of $0.00004 for a profitable return in the long-term. If the Terra Classic community can assure the wider crypto community that LUNC is safe, its adoption and price might rise. However, if it continues to get negative attention, like after the recent Terraport Finance hack, attracting new users to its ecosystem will be difficult. Another key factor that could affect its price is whether the Terra Classic quant team can restore its USTC stablecoin. Although this is a challenging task, success would generate a lot of excitement within the community. Lastly, the ongoing coin burning is gradually decreasing the Terra Classic circulating supply. If demand stays the same or increases, this could significantly boost the LUNC price. It is advised to do your own research and conduct experts’ analysis before investing in the volatilecrypto market. Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) is a cryptocurrency that originated from the original Terra blockchain, now known as Terra Classic. It was rebranded following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022. LUNC is a remnant of the old Terra chain, and it no longer supports the algorithmic stablecoin, USTC. The new Terra chain operates under the name Terra 2.0, while the old chain, Terra Classic, continues to be supported by its community. Terra Classic operates as a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, where transaction validators are chosen based on the amount of LUNC they hold. The Terra Classic community makes decisions regarding the burning and minting of LUNC, which is essential to managing its supply. LUNC can be bought, sold, and traded on various exchanges, and it plays a role in the ongoing efforts to restore stability within the Terra Classic ecosystem. After the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, the blockchain was split into two chains: Terra 2.0 (LUNA) and Terra Classic (LUNC). The primary difference between the two is that LUNC has a burn mechanism that aims to reduce its supply, while LUNA does not. Terra Classic also retains a connection to the original stablecoin, USTC, whereas Terra 2.0 does not support algorithmic stablecoins. LUNC has experienced significant price fluctuations since the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. After its relaunch in May 2022, LUNC’s price saw various peaks and troughs, influenced by market sentiment, tax proposals, and community-driven initiatives. Despite these efforts, the price of LUNC remains far below its previous highs, but ongoing burning efforts and community activities continue to shape its price movements. By 2025, LUNC’s price is forecasted to range between $0.000195 and $0.000239, with a projected average of $0.000202. Looking further ahead, LUNC is expected to gradually increase in value, reaching potential prices of $0.000509 in 2027, $0.000754 in 2028, and $0.0011 in 2029. By 2033, the price could potentially reach $0.0048 if favorable conditions persist. While the long-term potential of LUNC is promising, reaching $1 would require significant changes in market dynamics, adoption, and continued reduction of its circulating supply through burning mechanisms. Currently, such a price target seems challenging given the token’s current market conditions. It’s unlikely. The project’s severe collapse has made it hard to restore investor confidence or rebuild its ecosystem. Shayan Chowdhury is a freelance writer and digital nomad.

Alternatively, you can reach out to an existing Kibho associate for further information. To become an associate yourself, you’ll need to acquire Kibho Coins valued at Rs 500 from the company. These Kibho Coins can be purchased either through their K-Wallet orTrust Walletplatforms. It is important to know here that the platform is completely registered within the Indian jurisdiction.

Along with this, the firm offers bonus income to the clients as interest when the amount of tokens increases in a user’s account. Kibho cryptocurrencies value keeps moving up and down in line with the overall market sentiment. On registering with the platform, users get 2 Kibho cryptocurrencies. Consumers can convert the earned tokens to INR. As per the terms and conditions implemented by the company, users need to hold their tokens for up to 100 days. This is necessary to get profit from the platform. This makes it an investment system.

Interested people can visit it to open their accounts and get new opportunities to enhance their income. Since Kibho operates as an MLM company, the whole business strategy of the platform is founded on MLM. In this respect, the people who intend to make maximum profits with Kibho require joining their downline. Hence, those who remain successful in doing so can get a commission in return. The platform provides the respective commission in the form of its native tokenKibho cryptocurrency. On opening an account on Kibho with INR500, a couple of Kibho cryptocurrencies are provided to the newly coming user irrespective of the user’s gender.

Upon reaching the next level by activating 132 accounts, they qualify for “Voucher 2,” comprising a bike. Furthermore, upon achieving the activation of 1584 accounts, “Voucher 3” is provided, containing a car. These rewards and incentives play a significant role in motivating individuals to actively participate in the Kibho platform and contribute to its expansion. According to on-chain data, the journey of Kibho coin in the cryptocurrency market began on the 17th of March 2023, with an initialtradingprice of ₹1454.8. During the initial month, March, the price displayed relatively low volatility, hovering around this starting value for an extended period. However, as April dawned, a notable surge in trading activity was observed, sending the Kibho coin price toward its resistance levels. In the early days of April, the price surged above the ₹1660 mark, initiating an exponential ascent. The coin’s value reached a remarkable high of ₹2231. However, the market’s enthusiasm tumbled at these higher price levels, resulting in a sharp price correction. This correction led to a dip in the Kibho coin’s value, ultimately hitting a low of ₹1992 on the 11th of April. The decline persisted, and by the 21st of April, the coin had retreated to ₹1743. May brought renewed interest to the Kibho coin as buying demand surged, reversing its previous trend from ₹1660. During this period, the coin achieved multiple highs, peaking at ₹3237 on the 10th of May. It then maintained a bullish trajectory, revisiting the ₹3071 peak a few days later. However, this bullish rally turned out to be short-lived, as a substantial decline followed. The downward trend in the Kibho coin’s price continued into the final week of May, with the value dropping to ₹1079 on the 2nd of June. As the month progressed, the price experienced further declines, eventually falling below the significant psychological milestone of ₹830 for the first time. Recently, the Kibho coin price experienced extreme bearish activity, which intensified selling pressure near immediate resistance levels. Despite gaining buying attention in the past few months, the coin failed to bring enough buying pressure to hold near current price levels. As a result, amid the crypto market downturn, sellers are heavily liquidating their positions, bringing downward pressure on Kibho coin. After breaking below the ₹830 mark, Kibho’s price sparked an intense selling momentum and dropped further below. Kibho price is currently experiencing mixed volatility in the market following low liquidity and trading activity, as seen on the daily price chart. However, currently, sellers are looking to create pressure on the price as it tumbles near critical support levels. A thorough technical analysis of the Kibho coin price reveals bearish indicators, which may soon plunge the token to its lowest levels. The Kibho coin price is currently trading at ₹498, reflecting a decrease of 0.3% in the last 24 hours. Our technical evaluation of Kibho’s price indicates that the current bearish momentum may soon intensify as bears are attempting to plunge the asset below the bearish channel; however, bulls are trying to prevent the price from dropping below the critical support level of ₹415. Examining the daily price chart, Kibho coin’s price has found support near the ₹396 level, from which the price is set to make a bullish reversal. As Kibho’s price declined and now trades below the EMA20, bears are gaining confidence to open further short positions and send the price to test its resistance at ₹415. The Balance of Power (BoP) indicator is currently trading in a positive region zone as buyers are losing their domination on the price chart. To thoroughly analyze the price of the Kibho coin, it is crucial to take a look at the RSI-14 indicator. The RSI indicator recently experienced a decline as the coin’s price struggled to trade above ₹830. The trend line is currently trading around way below the midline as it hovers around the 36 level, hinting that a further downward correction is on the horizon. However, Kibho’s strong buying defense below ₹415 is building interest in the dip among buyers. It is anticipated that KBO’s price will soon attempt to break above its 23.6% Fibonacci level to achieve its short-term bullish goals of around ₹830. If bears fail to plunge below the current ₹3.154 Fibonacci region, a skyrocketing trend might be on the horizon. As the SMA-14 continues its upward swing, it trades slightly below the RSI line, potentially holding concerns about the coin’s downward movement on the price chart. If Kibho fails to hold above the critical support level of ₹415, a sudden collapse may occur, resulting in further price declines and causing the Kibho price to trade near the Bollinger band’s lower limit of ₹249. If the price fails to continue a trade above, it may trigger a more significant bearish downtrend to ₹99.6. Conversely, if Kibho’s price continues to surge, it can pave the way to resistance at ₹830. A breakout above will drive the coin’s price toward the upper limit of the Bollinger band at ₹1,079. For 2024, Kibho Coin’s price is anticipated to show growth, with an average price of about ₹360. The minimum price for the year might be around ₹300, and the maximum is estimated to be ₹660. This forecast takes into account the coin’s adoption and technological advancements.

The minimum price for the year could hover at about ₹400, and the maximum might touch ₹760. This estimate considers the coin’s growing popularity in the crypto market. For 2027, Kibho Coin’s price is projected to average approximately ₹510. The minimum price for the year might be around ₹450, and the maximum is estimated to be ₹810.

The minimum price for the year could be approximately ₹500, while the maximum might reach ₹860. This projection is influenced by the coin’s increasing adoption in various industries.

In 2033, Kibho Coin’s price is expected to sustain its growth trajectory, with an average price of approximately ₹810. The minimum price for the year could be around ₹750, and the maximum is estimated to reach ₹1,110. The platform also offers awards and rewards to its consumers.

If a person successfully activates sixty-six accounts he/she is given “Voucher 1” which contains a smartphone. On the next level, the activation of 132 accounts leads to “Voucher 2” which comprises a bike. Moving on, if 1584 accounts are activated by a person, “Voucher 3” is provided to him or her. It contains a car. After conducting a thorough examination, it has become evident that the Kibho Coin website exhibits numerous alarming indicators that cast doubt on its authenticity as a legitimate company. Let’s dive into each facet of Kibho Coin for a comprehensive evaluation. When scrutinizing Kibho Coin, it becomes apparent that their website is poorly designed. This deficiency raises valid concerns regarding the company’s professionalism and legitimacy. Furthermore, the certificates and evidence presented within their application appear to be counterfeit, thereby highlighting a troubling lack of transparency and credibility. Moreover, the conspicuous absence of active social media accounts serves as a significant red flag. Legitimate technology companies typically maintain a robust online presence to engage with their clientele and bring trust. The dearth of social media activity gives rise to suspicions about the authenticity and intentions of Kibho Coin. Another cause for apprehension pertains to the exceedingly attractive investment plan put forth by Kibho Coin. This tactic is often employed by unscrupulous actors to entice unsuspecting individuals into their schemes. It is of utmost importance to exercise vigilance when encountering such offers, as they are typically designed to ensnare and exploit individuals for personal gain. While Kibho Coin is actively promoting the demand for its coins through its MLM plan, the intrinsic value of these coins remains questionable. There is no discernible project or technology underpinning Kibho Coin, no proper roadmap, and its associated wallet, K-Wallet, is notably rudimentary, lacking unique features. Kibho Coin’s money-circulation scheme means that the company retains full control of all funds, precluding users from making withdrawals. This arrangement carries inherent risks for investors, as only a mere 1.66% of the total coins can be withdrawn. Consequently, users face considerable difficulties in accessing their investments, rendering this venture inherently risky. Another glaring issue with Kibho Coin is the company’s complete dominion over all commissions, with users unable to withdraw their earnings. A paltry 1.66% of the total coins are accessible for withdrawal, severely limiting users’ ability to retrieve their funds. This scenario exposes investors to potential losses should the value of Kibho Coin depreciate or if the company ceases operations, raising significant concerns about transparency and financial stability. Furthermore, the lack of external investors in Kibho Coin, coupled with the absence of notable technological advancements, significantly lowers the company’s credibility and brand value. When considering whether to become involved with Kibho, it is crucial to consider a number of critical factors. Firstly, the absence of external investors significantly devalues Kibho Coin. With limited interest from genuine investors, your investment is likely to remain stagnant and locked in for an extended duration. Additionally, the utilization of an MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) strategy by Kibho gives rise to concerns about the Ponzi scheme. Such schemes heavily rely on ongoing recruitment to sustain their financial structure, a practice that may prove unsustainable over the long term. Given these considerations, it is strongly recommended to abstain from any association with Kibho. By doing so, you can safeguard your hard-earned finances and precious time from potential risks and uncertainties. Explore the best crypto to buy now to secure the maximum profit in 2024.

    "news_title": "Dogecoin Price Prediction: Will Dogecoin Go Up?",
    "news_content": "Table of Contents Dogecoin, commonly identified by its ticker symbol DOGE, is a digital currency launched in 2013. Unlike other cryptocurrencies developed for specific purposes, Dogecoin emerged as a playful nod to an internet meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. This humorous origin tied to internet culture has developed a distinctive niche for Dogecoin within the cryptocurrency market. The coin was created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who adapted Bitcoin’s open-source code, as well as that of its derivative, Litecoin, to build Dogecoin. Despite its comedic roots, Dogecoin has gained traction as a serious cryptocurrency due to its highly active and passionate community. Though Dogecoin doesn’t offer many distinctive technical features compared to other digital currencies, a notable characteristic is its unlimited supply. In contrast to Bitcoin’s capped 21 million coin limit, Dogecoin’s mining is indefinite, resulting in constant inflation. In recent months, DOGE price witnessed a jump in its trading volume and currently aims to surpass new highs. OurDogecoin price predictionaims to explore the current DOGE price sentiment with in-depth technical analysis. Dogecoin (DOGE), the first dog-themed meme coin, was created in 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus (formerly of IBM) and Jackson Palmer (formerly of Adobe). They aimed to poke fun at the growing number of alternative coins seeking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s (BTC) success. The cryptocurrency took inspiration from the Doge meme, featuring a Shiba Inu dog, which became its logo and namesake. Dogecoin’s blockchain protocol was adapted from Luckycoin, an older cryptocurrency that’s no longer around. Luckycoin itself was a spin-off (or fork) of Litecoin (LTC), which, in turn, was derived fromBitcoin. Despite starting as a joke, DOGE quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts due to its low initial value of $0.000232. This made it perfect for small online transactions like tipping content creators. pic.twitter.com/VGzJQLbuPP In 2021, Dogecoin’s popularity skyrocketed along with a booming crypto market, driven partly by social media buzz. It inspired the creation of other Shiba Inu-themed coins. As the coin grew a dedicated following, Markus and Palmer eventually left the project, leaving the protocol undeveloped. Meanwhile, Elon Musk played into the social media frenzy around DOGE, dubbing it “the people’s crypto.” Dogecoin operates on its own blockchain like many other cryptocurrencies. The blockchain, or digital ledger, is continually updated with new transactions, and cryptography ensures that all transactions remain secure. The Dogecoin blockchain relies on a proof-of-work system, where miners use computers to solve complex mathematical problems. This process helps verify transactions, and once recorded on the blockchain, miners receive additional Dogecoin as a reward. They can either keep or sell these earned coins on the open market. Although Dogecoin can be used for payments and purchases, it’s not the best store of value because there’s no limit to how many coins can be mined over time, making the currency inherently inflationary. Every day, miners receive millions of new Dogecoins as rewards, which makes it difficult for speculative price increases to remain stable over the long term. In itswhitepaper, Dogecoin explains what it is. It says: “Dogecoin is a community-driven cryptocurrency that was inspired by a Shiba Inu meme. The Dogecoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Dogecoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Bitcoin Core and other cryptocurrencies.” The Dogecoin Foundation was established in 2014 to guide and support community development. Although it was later dissolved, the foundation was relaunched in 2021 when Dogecoin’s popularity surged with new investors and a soaring price. According to its website, the foundation aims to: The foundation is managed by original team members and advisors, including Max Keller (a core developer), Vitalik Buterin (Ethereumco-founder), and Jared Birchall, who represents Elon Musk. Let’s take a closer look at the ups and downs in Dogecoin’s price history. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future outcomes, understanding what the coin has achieved can offer valuable context when making or evaluating predictions. When Dogecoin launched in late 2013, its value was around $0.0001 and remained below one cent for most of its first seven years, except for a brief spike above $0.01 during the crypto bubble of late 2017 to early 2018. This changed during the bull run of early 2021, when Dogecoin’s price soared, transforming it from an underdog to a leading coin. It reached its all-time high of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021. However, the same day, Elon Musk called it a “hustle” on national TV, which, combined with a market downturn, brought the price down to $0.1673 by the end of that year. In 2022, Dogecoin couldn’t replicate its 2021 success. After the collapse of the LUNA cryptocurrency in May 2022, Dogecoin stayed below $0.10 (except for a brief period in late October and early November). By December 31, it was worth $0.06816, losing nearly 60% of its value for the year. However, it fared better than the overall crypto market, which declined almost 65%. Dogecoin started 2023 on a strong note, surpassing $0.10 in April but soon declining again. The SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, along with Crypto.com suspending its U.S. institutional operations, led to Dogecoin’s drop to $0.05854 by June 10. A recovery followed, with Dogecoin reaching $0.08334 on July 25 before collapsing again. On October 12, it was worth $0.05747. Despite this, Dogecoin rebounded over the next few months, breaking past $0.10 for the first time in over a year to hit a high of $0.1058 on December 11. It closed the year at $0.08947, an annual rise of over 30%. The decline continued into the new year, with Dogecoin at $0.08055 on January 29, 2024. However, by March 5, 2024, it bounced back to around $0.18. In March, the DOGE price skyrocketed following bullish market sentiment and it broke above $0.22 mark. However, it declined later and dropped below the $0.15 level in April. The bulls are aiming to keep Dogecoin from revisiting the neckline of the prominent head-and-shoulders pattern. Over the last 24 hours, DOGE price has been declining strongly and it is now testing buyers’ patience around the $0.14 support line. As of writing, DOGE price trades at $0.1407, declining over 2% in the last 24 hours. To pave the way for a rally toward the 50-day SMA ($0.166), buyers need to lift the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.145). This level is crucial for the bears to hold, as a breakthrough could initiate a rally up to $0.21. Alternatively, if the price declines from the current level or the 50-day SMA, the DOGE/USDT pair might linger in the existing range. The trend is expected to turn bearish if the price drops below $0.12. Dogecoin began 2024 quietly but soared rapidly from February into March as Bitcoin set multiple all-time highs. The crypto market nearly doubled in value over the past four months, reaching $2.66 trillion, fueling speculation, particularly in meme coins like Dogecoin. DOGE developers are building a payment system to integrate Dogecoin with retailers, payment providers, and social platforms. Positive updates are expected in 2024, though no specific timeline has been announced. Based on forecast data and technical analysis, Dogecoin’s price in 2024 is projected to have a minimum value of $0.1504. The maximum value could be $0.1749, with an average trading price estimated at $0.1553. The Dogecoin community and developers are working on the Dogecoin Trailmap, aiming to provide tools for developers and platforms to integrate DOGE as an easy payment option. Much of this work is expected to finish by 2025, supporting a strong bullish outlook for DOGE. Drawing insights from past price data, the projected Dogecoin price in 2025 is expected to reach at least $0.2150. The upper limit might be $0.2615, while the average trading value is likely to hover around $0.2212. In 2026, the minimum expected Dogecoin price is around $0.2973, as indicated by past technical analysis. The highest value could be $0.3712, with the average trading value anticipated to be $0.3062. The expected minimum price for a single Dogecoin in 2027 is $0.4563. It might reach up to $0.5219, with the average price likely at $0.4716. By 2028, forecasts suggest Dogecoin could have a minimum value of $0.6550. The potential maximum price is $0.7923, with an average trading price around $0.6785. Projections for 2029 indicate that Dogecoin might have a minimum value of $0.9330. The upper price could be $1.14, with the average expected to be around $0.9669. Dogecoin’s price is forecast to reach at least $1.36 in 2030. The maximum value may be $1.62, with an average trading value of $1.40. Forecasts for 2031 suggest a minimum value of $1.95. The potential maximum price could be $2.34, while the average is expected to be $2.02. By 2032, the predicted minimum Dogecoin price is $2.94. The maximum value is estimated to be $3.41, with an average trading value of $3.02. Looking at 2033, forecasts suggest Dogecoin could reach a minimum value of $4.23. The highest projected value is $5.01, while the average trading value may be $4.35. Coincodex’s current Dogecoin price forecast anticipates a decrease of 13.81%, predicting the cryptocurrency’s value will decline to $0.123659 by June 11, 2024. Their technical analysis indicates a bearish market sentiment, while the Fear & Greed Index registers at 56, indicating greed. Over the past 30 days, Dogecoin has experienced green trading days in 10 out of 30 instances (33%) and demonstrated a 7.57% volatility rate. According to these insights, it is currently considered a poor time to invest in Dogecoin. Historical price trends and Bitcoin’s halving cycles suggest a projected yearly low of $0.122280 for Dogecoin in 2025, while next year’s price could reach a high of $0.614093. Digital Coin Price projects that by 2026, Dogecoin (DOGE) will commence trading at $0.42 and hover around $0.52. This forecast indicates a substantial increase compared to the previous year’s figures, suggesting a considerable jump for the cryptocurrency. Looking ahead, technical analysis and price predictions anticipate Dogecoin will reach $1.05 by early 2030 and maintain this level through the year’s end. During that time frame, it’s also expected that DOGE could fluctuate up to $0.97. Market analysts and experts view the period between 2024 and 2030 as significant for Dogecoin’s growth trajectory. Dogecoin currently has a market value exceeding $31 billion, though it doesn’t offer much practical use. This high valuation is largely driven by investors speculating that Elon Musk will keep supporting Dogecoin and integrate it into X. Although Dogecoin could rally once more, its heavy dependence on Elon Musk poses a risk to the project. Additionally, compared to other leading altcoins, Dogecoin falls short in terms of token economics due to its unlimited supply and the fact that ten wallets hold nearly 46% of all the coins in circulation. It is advised to invest in DOGE at a price of $0.12 for a profitable return in the long term. In 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter and subsequently merged it with X Corp. in April 2023. His goal is to build an “everything app” akin to China’s WeChat, with plans to integrate it with Tesla and his Starlink satellite service, and potentially with his space exploration company, SpaceX. Musk’s penchant for satire and his enthusiasm for Dogecoin suggest that DOGE could be included as a payment option in the new X app, an idea he has hinted at in the past. If implemented, Dogecoin might establish itself as a strong long-term cryptocurrency. Additionally, a group of developers is working on tools that will enable businesses to easily incorporate Dogecoin payments into their systems. The Dogecoin team subtly hints at X by listing “social platforms” as potential entities that could incorporate Dogecoin. However, it is advised to do your own research before investing in the volatile memecoin market. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that started as a joke in 2013, inspired by the popular “Doge” internet meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. Despite its humorous beginnings, Dogecoin has gained a large and active community, with a focus on small transactions and tipping content creators online. Dogecoin operates on its own blockchain, using a proof-of-work system similar to Bitcoin. Miners solve complex math problems to verify transactions and earn Dogecoin as rewards. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, leading to constant inflation. The Dogecoin Foundation, established in 2014 and relaunched in 2021, aims to support the Dogecoin community, protect its trademark, and provide a roadmap for the future. Advisors include original team members and notable figures like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk’s representative, Jared Birchall. Dogecoin started at a very low value and remained under one cent for years. It surged in 2021, reaching an all-time high of $0.7376. However, it faced a decline afterward and fluctuated throughout 2022 and 2023. As of early 2024, Dogecoin has seen a mix of ups and downs, currently trading around $0.1014. Long-term predictions suggest Dogecoin could reach $1.14 by 2029 and potentially rise to $1.62 by 2030, depending on market conditions and adoption. Dogecoin has the potential to rise, especially with ongoing development and possible integration into platforms like Elon Musk’s X app. However, its future remains uncertain, and investing in Dogecoin should be approached with caution and thorough research.

    "news_title": "The Ideal Web3 Game Must Have Web2-Style Gameplay",
    "news_content": "The slow but sure rise of Web3 has given birth to the concept of “play-to-earn” games that integrate with blockchain to provide players with ownership of their gaming assets and the ability to get paid for doing what they love best. But despite some initial success, notably during the height of the COVID pandemic when some people claimed to be making enough money to pay their living costs simply by playing games, Web3 game titles remain something of a niche product, with very fewrealvideo games players embracing them. You might not be able to make any money playing popular video games like Grand Theft Auto, Ghost Recon and Fortnite, but most players don’t actually care about this. The reason they play games is because they want to have fun, and that appears to be something that Web3 games developers have forgotten about in their rush to bring blockchain gaming to the fore. Games like Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties both enjoyed a comparative degree of success, creating strong communities around their games, making headlines around the world. They were early showcases of how blockchain can be used to create unique digital assets from NFTs. These NFTs represent in-game assets, like characters, skins, weapons and accessories, that players can own and trade freely with one another. Blockchain also supports the creation of tokens, or in-game currencies that players can earn as rewards for winning battles and progressing through the game, enabling them to monetize their time and effort. The idea of getting paid for playing games is intriguing and it was undoubtedly the reason why Axie Infinity became so popular circa 2021, with some players reporting that they could earn hundreds of dollars per week. However, it was also the reason why Axie Infinity failed. Ultimately, the in-game economy proved itself to be unsustainable, as it was reliant on a continual flow of new players entering the game to provide capital for existing players to earn. The gameplay itself was seen asrepetitive and boring, and with the ever-dwindling profits being the only real incentive for people to keep playing, it struggled to keep adding them. When Axie fell by the wayside, a new generation of crypto games emerged that have focused on improving the gameplay and making the experience more enjoyable. Star Atlasbilled itself as the first AAA play-to-earn game, with its awe-inspiring graphics and an enormous gaming universe that one player alone could never hope to explore. As a space-based MMORPG exploration, trading and mining game, Star Atlas aimed to merge blockchain with real-time graphics, immersive gameplay and DeFi-like mechanics. Its stunning visuals were enabled by Unreal Engine 5’s Nanite system, creating an expansive universe of truly alien worlds ripe for territorial conquest and expansion. In Start Atlas, players are tasked with flying around and exploring the universe, discovering new planets and exploiting them for resources. They can trade with other players, create alliances, declare war on others, become a pirate and attack traders, make money from mining and more besides. It’s a truly open-ended experience. As ambitious as the game is, it has struggled to match the success of Web2-based MMORPG games, but the reason for its failure is not because the gameplay is lacking. Rather, Star Atlas seems to have put too much focus on its Web3 elements. To become successful in Star Atlas and compete with the best, players have little choice but to immerse themselves in the DeFi aspects of the game. Star Atlas’s economy is heavily focused on the idea of lending, where players either need to borrow money to get started in the game by purchasing essential resources, or make money by lending it out to keep up with the profitability of their rivals. The key to making money in Star Atlas is to become an expert in yield farming, which involves identifying assets to borrow at lower yields, then trading and lending them out at higher yields to make money on the spread. Of course, to negotiate these markets one needs the skills of a DeFi trader or an economist, and managing these investments quickly becomes a major headache, distracting the player from the actual fun aspects of the game. Just like Axie Infinity, Star Atlas was guilty of putting too much emphasis on the Web3 aspects of the game. Whereas Axie was singularly focused on making money by winning repetitive battles over and over, Star Atlas became more of a trading experience, where users found themselves immersed in financial markets in a struggle to make enough money to compete against their richer rivals. Neither game put much emphasis on having fun. This kind of experience can quickly alienate the traditional gamer, especially casual gamers who simply want to pick up and play for 20 minutes of fun before they get back to work or class or go and hang out with their friends. For Web3 games to succeed, developers need to realize that, first and foremost, most players want a game that’s fun, making it enjoyable to play, and they want an experience that’s addictive, so they keep coming back for more. The secret for success is to focus on the game first, make sure it’s fun and engaging so they have a foundation of captivating gameplay that can be enhanced with Web3 functionality. In other words, Web3 needs to be more of an add-on rather than the main focus of the experience, and it’s something that very few blockchain games have done to date. However, there are signs that some developers are beginning to get the balance right. The new mobile gameDrift Zone: Arenais fast gaining popularity on Telegram, where it’s available to play as a mini-app that doesn’t even need to be downloaded. It takes advantage of Telegram’s integration with the TON blockchain to give players access to a ready-made wallet they can use to store their DT tokens that are central to the game’s economy. Drift Zone: Arena is a card-based battle game, where players collect “Drifters”, which represent different characters they can use to fight against other players in auto-battles, with the outcome determined by the attributes of each one. Players compete in one-on-one, player-vs-player battles to earn coins and climb the ranks of the leaderboard. There’s a lot of emphasis on strategy, as players can use the coins they earn to upgrade their Drifters or even merge them together to create even more powerful and advanced Drifters with more lethal attributes, leaving lots of room for experimentation. As players progress through the 18 available levels, they face new challenges and earn different rewards along the way. Progressing through the levels is not as simple as it looks, though, for players will not only need to accumulate enough coins, but also prove themselves out on the battleground. Drift Zone: Arena’s secret is that most players won’t even realize that they’re playing a crypto game. The DT tokens they earn from winning battles are a bona fide cryptocurrency that can be bought and sold on crypto exchanges, but players won’t realize this unless they specifically research it to find out for themselves. That’s because the developers of the game only ever emphasize the gameplay itself. It can be thought of as a kind of “stealth blockchain game” that’s easy to access and fun, with exciting gameplay and unpredictable rewards on offer. Players don’t need to know anything about blockchain or crypto to play the game, the only thing they’ll know is that they’ll enjoy playing it. By focusing on elevating the gameplay experience, developers of Web3 games can succeed where those who went before they failed to make a long lasting impact. If a game is to enjoy any kind of longevity, it needs to provide a polished and engaging gameplay experience that’s accessible to every kind of player, and not just the crypto natives. With Web3 games, the rewards should never be the reason for playing the game. Only when people are playing blockchain games for fun will the concept start to take off.
