    "news_content": "SPONSORED POST* Investors are looking for new prospects as the bull run is approaching in the crypto space. As of this time, some of the biggest names in this space are dealing with serious setbacks within the market and their investors are looking for diversification of portfolios. With the growth slowing down within Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) networks, Zig Network’s appeal of a sustainable blockchain with a revenue sharing model has been attracting their long time holders. The market sentiment is looking good forZig Network (ZIG)offerings for a token price of only $0.01 and experts consider this to be the right time for investment. Summary Cardano (ADA) has been receiving mixed responses in the market. In fact, after the Summit held in Dubai, analysts are warning that its price could drop by as much as 30%, with its possible support level pegged at $0.23, according to crypto analyst Skinny, who believes it hasn’t reached the bottom yet. However, still, many in the community are optimistic about its long-term growth and some even project it to touch between $3 and $16 in the future. For now, though, the short-term technical data of Cardano (ADA) has indicated that it has to surpass $0.41 to start moving up. With these ups and downs, some Cardano (ADA) holders are exploring new DeFi projects like Zig Network (ZIG) as a way to diversify their investments. Despite the features of high speed and low fees that make Solana (SOL) a very attractive blockchain, its recent challenges in the market have led to questions about its long term scalability. Solana (SOL) initially aimed for a single chain approach but recently introduced Network Extensions, their take on Layer 2 solutions, to manage scalability. Despite a few setbacks, such as high bandwidth requirements and centralization risks, Solana (SOL) maintains a strong user base. Solana’s development direction has caught the eye of those interested in innovative networks, such as Zig Network (ZIG), which offers a fresh opportunity for investors looking to expand into projects with revenue sharing potential. Zig Network (ZIG)is making waves as the first revenue sharing blockchain, offering holders the chance to earn a portion of platform generated fees. Zig Network’s decentralized governance and staking options can benefit token holders through passive income. The Zig debit card will allow holders to make real world purchases, while the VIP program rewards major investors. Zig Network’s focus on security is evident through a third party smart contract audit and liquidity will be locked indefinitely to secure early investors. For Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) holders, Zig Network (ZIG) represents an opportunity to get involved in a project with strong growth potential, as the network promises value sharing at every level of participation. As Zig Network’s ecosystem continues to grow, early participants stand to benefit significantly, making it an exciting venture for those looking to diversify beyond Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) in 2024.
