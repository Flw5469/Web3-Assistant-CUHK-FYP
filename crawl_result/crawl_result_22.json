However, the... byVismaya V·4 min read Coins Payments processor Stripe is back in the crypto game after announcing today that it will soon allow merchants to receive funds in the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin. \nStarting this summer, the San Francisco-based firm will let companies that use its technology accept USD Coin (USDC) for online payments. USDC is the second biggest stablecoin in the crypto space and the sixth biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. \n“We’re excited about empowering Stripe users to accept stablecoin payments, helping them... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Business USDC stablecoin issuer Circle will discontinue support for legacy consumer accounts, the company said on Tuesday.\nThe USD Coin token is a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, meaning that Circle maintains $1 in reserves—in cash or cash equivalents—to back each of the $25 billion worth of tokens in circulation. USDC is the second-most popular dollar-backed stablecoin behind Tether (USDT), which on Tuesday had a market capitalization of $85 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n“Circle is phasing out support... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Law and Order House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry signaled on Friday that stablecoin regulation is still top of mind, despite a potential government shutdown looming on the horizon.\n“Things are complicated right now,” McHenry said, speaking over Zoom to a crowd gathered in New York at a forum organized by stablecoin issuer Circle. “But I'm gonna do my best to get this to the president's desk.”\nStablecoins are digital assets pegged to the price of a sovereign currency like the U.S. dollar.... byAndré Beganski·3 min read Business Centre Consortium, which issues second-largest stablecoin USDC, has been dissolved as Coinbase acquires a minority share in Circle Internet Financial, according to a blog post from the company.\n\"Centre will no longer exist as a stand-alone entity and Circle will remain as the issuer of USDC, bringing any Centre governance and operations responsibilities in-house,\" Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a jointly-authored blog post. The announcement added that revenue... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Business Members of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee turned their attention to stablecoins Wednesday, picking up where they left off on regulation pushed back last year. But lawmakers said any progress made since then is tenuous at best.\nFSC ranking member Maxine Waters (D-CA) suggested that lawmakers are “starting from scratch” after Republicans made alterations to a bill that died on the vine last year ahead of the midterm election called the Stablecoin TRUST Act.\nLawmakers’ most recent pass... byAndré Beganski·6 min read Coins USDC stablecoin issuer Circle has claimed that it will “cover any shortfall” caused as a result of the $3.3 billion in its funds held by the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank.\nIn a blog post, Circle wrote that the company is legally obliged to “stand behind” USDC and will cover any shortfall using corporate resources—and \"external capital if necessary\"—to ensure that the stablecoin can be redeemed at a ratio of 1 for 1 with the U.S. Dollar. CEO Jeremy Allaire reiterated the commitment in a Twitter t... byJason Nelson·3 min read Business Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com will no longer facilitate transactions involving Tether in Canada and plans to delist the largest stablecoin by market capitalization for customers in the region.\n“Crypto.com has delisted USDT for users in Canada in accordance with instructions from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) as part of our pre-registration undertaking for a restricted dealer license,” a spokesperson for Crypto.com told Decrypt.\nCanadian users of the exchange were notified about th... byAndré Beganski·4 min read Business The collapse of FTX and automatic conversions of USD Coin on Binance will cause Circle’s performance to be “materially lower” than the projections it made in February, the company said in a new regulatory filing. \nIn it, Circle disclosed that the “tiny” FTX equity that Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire alluded to on Twitter last week is a $10.6 million investment the company made in the FTX Group, according to new regulatory filings.\nRelatively speaking, the $10.6 million probably is small for Circle.... byStacy Elliott·5 min read Coins Coinbase will custody $1.6 billion worth of MarkerDAO’s USD Coin (USDC) treasury with its institutional-grade service, allowing the DAO to earn up to 1.5% rewards on the funds.\nThe proposal was ratified with 75% of the votes in favor on Monday afternoon after Coinbase Institutional submitted it on September 6. The USDC represents one-third of the treasury backing the Peg Stability Module, which allows users to deposit collateral in exchange for DAI, Maker’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin.\nMaker w... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Coins After a 7-week rally in May and June that sent USD Coin’s market capitalization above $56 billion, an all-time high, Circle’s stablecoin has now lost all the ground it gained earlier this year.\nOn Monday, USDC had a market cap of $46 billion—the lowest it’s been since January of this year. \nUSDC was recently dealt a blow from an effort to “enhance liquidity and capital-efficiency” at Binance.  At the start of September, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume said that it would begin autom... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Business Binance conversions of Circle's USDC, Paxos's Pax Dollar, and TrueUSD to the exchange’s own stablecoin, Binance USD, have begun. And the effects on the stablecoin market are already being felt.\nSince Binance's announcement that it would discontinue support for competing stablecoins on its exchange, the world's largest by volume, USDC outflows from Binance—that is, the number of USDC stablecoins leaving the exchange—are up by 93%. Meanwhile, USDC's market cap has fallen by 5%. \nAs of Wednesday af... byStacy Elliott·5 min read Coins For a while there, it looked like Circle’s USDC stablecoin was within range to overtake Tether, its biggest competitor.\nStarting in June and through the end of July, the gap between the two stablecoins’ market capitalizations hovered around $10 billion. While that’s still a pretty sizable lead, keep in mind that USDT and USDC started the year with $36 billion worth of daylight between them.\nBut things have shifted dramatically since then. At the time of writing, USDT’s market cap is $68 billion... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Business Russia is advancing its crypto strategy to circumvent Western sanctions. \nDeputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseyev today said the country is exploring stablecoins to make payments with “friendly countries,” according to Russian state news agency Tass. \nThe country’s biggest news agency quoted Moiseyev saying that Russia is working to “create bilateral platforms” with “tokenized instruments” to avoid using U.S. dollars and euros. \nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to another asset, l... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Long Reads During a Crypto Winter, investors tend to stash a portion of their bull market gains in stablecoins to wait out the downturn.\nBut over the past two months—through Terra's UST stablecoin collapse, panic over a potential bank run at crypto lending company Celsius, and insolvency for crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital—that bearish behavior has played out very differently for the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization: Tether (USDT) and US Dollar Coin (USDC).\nWhile Tether’s market cap... byStacy Elliott·8 min read Coins When Terra and its UST stablecoin collapsed last week in tandem with a marketwide crypto crash, things looked very shaky for crypto in general and stablecoins in particular.\nBut the crash produced at least one winner in terms of market cap and, potentially, reputation: USDC stablecoin.\nAs UST was headed for zero and USDT (Tether) was processing billions in redemptions, USDC was padding its market cap. At the start of the crash on May 8, USD Coin had a market capitalization between $48 billion an... byJeff Benson·5 min read Coins Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler leveled sharp criticism at cryptocurrency exchanges and stablecoins during an interview on Tuesday.\nGensler took issue with the fact that many of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges run custody, market-making, and trading services without keeping them separate the way traditional exchanges are required to.\n“Crypto’s got a lot of those challenges—of platforms trading ahead of their customers,” Gensler told Bloomberg. “In fact, they’re trading... byStacy Elliott·2 min read Coins As the market panics over the implications of Terra’s UST losing its dollar peg, questions have been raised about its asset-backed stablecoin competitors, Tether and USD Coin. \nTether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC)—the two largest stablecoins by market cap, respectively—are backed by the U.S. dollar, meaning that the issuers of these coins ostensibly maintain reserves of cash or cash equivalents to back each coin that’s in circulation. \nThe idea being that if an investor decided to redeem their USDT... byStacy Elliott·5 min read Business Circle has selected Bank of New York Mellon as its primary custodian for USD Coin (USDC) reserves. \nIn the past six months, Circle has seen its valuation double to $9 billion and the market cap of its USDC stablecoin increase 60% to $51 billion. \n“Building trust, stability and resilience in the digital asset economy is foundational to Circle’s mission,” said Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. “As we continue to see exponential growth in USDC, the opportunity to work with BNY Mellon is one... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Investigations “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they aren’t after you.” That adage has been attributed to everyone from Henry Kissinger to Kurt Cobain, but these days it would be a fitting motto for the crypto industry.\nIn 2021, crypto believers became convinced that the U.S. government has it in for them. And not without reason: A series of decisions by the SEC and other regulators suggested that federal officials are not just indifferent to the industry, but actively hostile to it.\nThe question is... byJeff John Roberts·14 min read Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company.2024Decrypt Media, Inc.",

In this course we'll explore how it works. We explore Web 3, the next major iteration of the Internet, which promises to wrest control from the centralized corporations that today dominate the web. Law and Order Tron founder Justin Sun is many things. You can now count prime minister among them.\nThis week, the micronation of Liberland—a largely theoretical European state cooked up by right-wing libertarians in 2015—announced that it elected Sun to serve as its head of state. \nSo what exactly does that mean in practical terms?

This comes as the protocol starts to fall out of favor after its summer-time high.\nA total of 89 Pump.fun coins are currently above a market cap of $1 million, according to Pump.fun. This means just 0.0045% of the near 2 million tokens are sitting above $1 million. \nThat said, over the past 24 hours, only 1.5% of tokens launched have “graduated” to Solana decentralized exchange Ra... byRyan S. Gladwin·3 min read Markets Tron (TRX) has fallen out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. This comes as meme coin traders appear to be losing interest in the network’s meme coin launchpad, SunPump.\nFollowing the launch of SunPump by Tron’s controversial founder Justin Sun, TRX climbed 24.8% to $0.168 as it broke into the top 10 cryptocurrencies. At this peak, SunPump was responsible for 7,531 tokens being created on Tron.\nBut for the past two days, SunPump has seen fewer than 1,... byRyan S.

But this token creation dominance was short-lived. On Wednesday, according to Dune data, SunPump created just 1,258 tokens, falling 83% from 7,531 tokens created just two weeks prior.\nThis decline can also be seen in the Tron launchpad... byRyan S. Gladwin·3 min read Markets Tron (TRX) has leapfrogged Toncoin (TON) to become the 10th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, following the arrest of Telegram boss Pavel Durov and a spike in interest in meme coins on Tron.\nHowever, the race is tight: TRX's market cap currently stands at $14.31 billion; TON's is $14.23 billion.\nFrench authorities arrested Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of encrypted messaging app Telegram, outside of Paris on Saturday.

Without the Bitcoin, worth around $726 million, USDD is now primarily backed by TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain.\nThe move—spotted on X on Tuesday—was made without any apparent official action by the TRON DAO.

Gladwin·3 min read Law and Order The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed an amended complaint in its lawsuit against Tron founder Justin Sun, arguing that because he \"traveled extensively\" to the U.S., the case falls under the country's jurisdiction.\nIn the complaint, the SEC notes that over three years from 2017 to 2019, Sun spent around 380 days in the U.S., undertaking business trips to New York City, Boston and San Francisco in 2019.

Here’s why they matter to the crypto ecosystem. As Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem grows, Bitcoin holders increasingly want to take part. Enter ERC-20 token Wrapped Bitcoin, a 1:1 representation of BTC. Coins Coinbase's launch of its wrapped Bitcoin product, cbBTC, has ignited a fierce debate within the industry, with Tron (TRON) founder Justin Sun lambasting the new offering, calling it a \"dark day for BTC\" and warning of significant risks to decentralized finance. \nSpeaking with Decrypt, however, a Coinbase spokesperson stood firm on the product's security and reliability. The cbBTC token is available on Ethereum and Coinbase's Base network and can be used in various DeFi platforms. \n\"cbBTC lacks P... byMurtuza Merchant·3 min read The Coins One way to understand blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is as separate distributed databases. As blockchains are separate, they can’t communicate easily with each other. \nYou can’t use your Bitcoin directly on the Ethereum blockchain, because only the Bitcoin blockchain “knows” that you hold Bitcoin. \nWrapped tokens were created as a solution to this problem. With wrapped tokens, you can effectively move assets between blockchains and use them across the crypto ecosystem.\nWhat are wrapp... byJoseph O'Neill·5 min read The Coins Bitcoin is the world’s first, largest, and most-recognized crypto asset. Since Bitcoin’s creation over a decade ago, the technology behind the revolutionary “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” has largely remained the same. \nBut Bitcoin isn't the be-all and end-all of cryptocurrency. On smart contract blockchains such as Ethereum, developers have created a thriving decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\nIn order to use Bitcoin within Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem, it's necessary to create an ERC-... byKi Chong Tran·4 min read Coins Despite Wrapped Bitcoin's surging popularity in 2021, its supply growth has stagnated since December of last year, according to a report from crypto financial intelligence provider CoinMetrics this week.\nWrapped Bitcoin is an ERC-20 Ethereum token backed 1:1 by Bitcoin (BTC). All wBTC is redeemable for actual BTC held custodially in a multi-signature wallet controlled by BitGo. The asset is similar to dollar-pegged stablecoins, which allow holders to effectively transfer and utilize their fiat m... byAndrew Throuvalas·2 min read DeFi 22Bitcoin’s price is near its all-time high, but that’s not the only metric rising to record levels, as Wrapped Bitcoin trading on the Uniswap exchange continues to grow.\nUniswap trading volume for WBTC rose to a new single-day all-time high of nearly $143 million on February 6, according to blockchain data provider Glassnode, part of a stunning rise that has seen Bitcoin worth hundreds of millions of dollars make its way onto the Ethereum blockchain.\nWrapped BTC volume on Uniswap over time. Ima... byAlexander Behrens·3 min read Coins Crypto exchange Coinbase today announced that starting Monday, October 19, its “Pro” exchange will support Wrapped Bitcoin, or WBTC.\nThe San Francisco-based company, which operates one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said that it would accept deposits of WBTC on Monday from US customers outside of New York state.\nTrading will commence on “or after 9AM Pacific Time (PT) Tuesday, October 20, if liquidity conditions are met.” It’ll go live with two pairings: WBTC-USD and WBTC-USD.... byRobert Stevens·2 min read Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company.2024Decrypt Media, Inc.",

Burning tokens involves indefinitely removing a digital asset from circulation and reducing its supply. Here’s how it works. Markets Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO) has broken into the top 25 meme coins by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. This comes after the token was listed on exchanges Binance, Crypto.com, HTX, and OKX over the past three days.\nEarlier this year Kabosu, the mascot of Dogecoin, sadly passed away. Two months later, Kabosu’s owner adopted a new Shiba-Inu called Neiro. This caused a meme coin war as two Solana meme coins launched in the new pup’s honor and then the Ethereum NEIRO entered the picture, v... byRyan S. Gladwin·3 min read Markets After dropping 4.7% over the last seven days, Cardano has fallen out of the top 10 tokens by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko data.\nAt the same time of this Cardano (ADA) drawback, Toncoin (TON) climbed 3.2% over a seven day period making it into the top 10. This isn’t the first time this exact swap has happened, in April Toncoin flipped Cardano after TON jumped 12% in a day.\nADA is trading at $0.46 after having gained 0.6% in the past day. Meanwhile, while TON is at $6.47 and has c... byRyan S. Gladwin·2 min read Markets During this market lull, meme coins have still been performing but this trend appears to have come to an end. The top meme coins have seen losses that outweigh Ethereum’s drop in the last 24 hours.\nLegacy meme coin Dogecoin has dropped 6.8% while Shiba Inu slipped 5.5% in the past day. Meanwhile, Dogwifhat fell a sizable 12.3%. It wasn’t just dog coins though, even Pepe saw a decline of 7.3% and Book of Meme fell 9.6%, according to CoinGecko data.\nThis comes after somewhat of a meme supercycle,... byRyan S. Gladwin·2 min read Markets Bitcoin is trading at $63,330, representing a -1.5% dip in the last 24 hours as it recovers from a dip last week. The rest of the crypto market is following suit, and meme coins are also suffering. They post big gains when markets are green, but bleed hard when bears take over.\nSolana-based Dogwifhat (WIF) is the only meme coin in the top 100 of the largest cryptocurrencies that is posting gains today, edging up from $3.20 to $3.36, marking a 2.75% spike in the last 24 hours. The coin is current... byJose Antonio Lanz·3 min read Coins A consortium of prominent crypto VCs has backed meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) to the tune of $12 million for a stake in the ecosystem’s upcoming “layer three” blockchain—a stake that will come in the form of a new TREAT token.\nInvestors include Animoca Brands, Polygon Ventures, DWF Ventures, Spirit Dao, and others.\n“Through the involvement of these venture capital firms and their strategic partners, we are expanding not only our network of trusted partners, but also exponentially increasing what Sh... byAndrew Throuvalas·3 min read Coins There’s good reason to believe the enigmatic Shiba Inu meme coin founder “Ryoshi” is sitting on 10% of the total SHIB supply, despite repeatedly claiming to own no SHIB tokens.\nIt might even be more accurate to say they own 17% of the supply, considering that 41% of the tokens had been burned by 2022. Regardless, Ryoshi may be holding a SHIB fortune worth $1.8 billion at today’s prices, according to an analysis by crypto forensics firm Bubblemaps. That means when SHIB’s market cap ballooned to $... byStacy Elliott·6 min read Coins Dogecoin's run has slowed recently, but the top memecoin is still one of the biggest winners over a seven-day period. The price of DOGE is $0.15, according to CoinGecko data. That's an increase of nearly 65% for the week.\nEarlier today, the 10th biggest digital asset had reached a high of $0.18—meaning it had doubled in price. But it has since lost those gains as the crypto market tumbled earlier this morning in the afterglow of a new all-time high price for Bitcoin.\nElsewhere, Shiba Inu (SHIB),... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Markets With a crypto market surge propelling Bitcoin to $65,000, just 6% below its all-time high, meme coins like PepeCoin, Dogecoin, and BONK are following in its wake with double-digit gains on the day.\nOf the meme coins in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, frog-themed PEPE is leading the charge, up 35.6% over the past 24 hours and a massive 421.8% over the past seven days.

Over the week that rise is much steeper, too; the cryptocurrency has soared a whopping 90% since last Thursday.\nPepecoin, as... byLiam J. Kelly·2 min read Business After a rocky start last week, Shiba Inu's Layer-2 network Shibarium is expected to relaunch with a new monitoring system and other features designed to help it cope with high levels of traffic.\nIn their latest blog post, the pseudonymous Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama stated that after two days of “testing and tweaking parameters” to achieve a \"ready\" state, “Shibarium is now enhanced and optimized.”\n“As mentioned it is still in testing, but producing blocks,” wrote Kusama. “Moreover, we h... byAndrew Asmakov·3 min read Markets From being the market’s biggest bulls this time last week, meme coins Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have now turned into the market’s biggest bears. \nOver the last seven days, both coins have plummeted in value, posting losses of over 20%, according to CoinGecko. \nPEPE leads the fall with a 22% drop, currently changing hands at $0.00000111.

Here’s what you need to know. Dogecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency based on a popular Internet meme. The token started off as a joke, but it's become a serious proposition. Markets Twitter owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk appears to have inspired multiple meme coins to run as he continues to tour the United States with Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. This includes a micro-cap Solana token launched via Pump.fun spiking by 10,000%, as well as other Musk-inspired tokens posting double-digit gains.\nMusk has joined Trump on stage multiple times over the past month, as the world's richest man has been touted to run the potential future Department of Governmental Efficiency (D... byRyan S. Gladwin·3 min read Markets Dogecoin continues its surge—and it's now the best performing cryptocurrency among the top 100 coins over the past 24 hours.\nThe original meme coin hit a peak price of nearly $0.16 on Monday afternoon, according to CoinGecko, marking a nearly five-month high after last touching that price in early June.\nDown slightly from that peak, DOGE is now up almost 12% on the day at a current price of $0.157, making it the biggest gainer in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\nThe gradual climb of t... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Markets Elon Musk said over the weekend that he’s not “actively involved” in crypto. He just likes Dogecoin.\nAt a pro-Donald Trump political rally in Pennsylvania Sunday, the world’s richest man was asked whether he would try and get the use of blockchain technology into government. \nMusk is now an outspoken Republican and is endorsing ex-President Trump for another term in the White House. Trump has said that Musk, a longtime Dogecoin (DOGE) fan, may lead a government efficiency commission—dubbed the D... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Markets Dogecoin (DOGE) shot up in value late Thursday after Telsa CEO and billionaire Elon Musk briefly mentioned the meme coin’s name during a town hall meeting in Folsom, Pennsylvania on Thursday.\nDuring the event at Ridley High School, an attendee asked Musk if he would head up a new “Department of Government Efficiency.” Musk responded with a lighthearted grin, “Yeah, Doge,” eliciting cheers and applause from the crowd. \nDogecoin’s value has since climbed to $0.13 and is up more than 6.8% in the la... byVismaya V·3 min read Markets It's 2021 all over again. Bitcoin may be up today, but the biggest winner is the original meme coin, Dogecoin. And the reason, it appears, is Elon Musk.\nOver the last 24 hours, the price of Dogecoin has increased by nearly 12%, according to CoinGecko data. Its price now stands at $0.1264.\n\nOver the past seven days, DOGE has jumped by nearly 18%, making it the best performing cryptocurrency out of the top 40 biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap.\nBillionaire entrepreneur Musk tweeted on Tuesday... byMat Di Salvo·3 min read Coins Shark Tank star Mark Cuban is a famous supporter of Dogecoin, the original crypto meme coin. However, in a recent interview, the billionaire entrepreneur and investor said that he believes that “every meme coin is a rug pull in the works”—but that is also what makes them fun. \nMeme coins are extremely volatile crypto tokens largely motivated by sensational hype as traders speculate on their price. They're often based on internet memes, public figures, or world events, though we've seen some coin... byRyan S. Gladwin·4 min read Markets It’s a good day to be a degen.\nThat's especially true if you invested in Moo Deng (MOODENG), the viral coin that's making explosive gains this week, but it isn't only baby pygmy hippo coins that are deep in the green today.\nThe top 10 meme coins are all up over the past 24 hours, with many notable projects jumping by double-figure percentages. This comes as Solana meme coin factory Pump.fun starts to regain traction following a poor month in which a Tron-based rival threatened its dominance.\nSec... byRyan S. Gladwin·3 min read Markets Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO) has broken into the top 25 meme coins by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. This comes after the token was listed on exchanges Binance, Crypto.com, HTX, and OKX over the past three days.\nEarlier this year Kabosu, the mascot of Dogecoin, sadly passed away. Two months later, Kabosu’s owner adopted a new Shiba-Inu called Neiro. This caused a meme coin war as two Solana meme coins launched in the new pup’s honor and then the Ethereum NEIRO entered the picture, v... byRyan S. Gladwin·3 min read Business On Thursday, a federal judge dismissed a class action lawsuit accusing Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, of market manipulation through public praise of Dogecoin.\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who claimed to have lost money due to Musk’s comments on social media in recent years, had sought $86 billion in damages, with a request for triple damages, bringing the total to $258 billion.\nThe lawsuit centered on Musk’s various public statements about Dogecoin, primarily made via posts on X (forme... byRyan Ozawa·3 min read Coins Tesla CEO Elon Musk has an on-again-off-again relationship with cryptocurrency.\nThis week, he seems favorably inclined towards Bitcoin, announcing that he sees \"some merit\" in it and unspecified other cryptocurrencies, and reiterating his enthusiasm for the dog-themed meme coin Dogecoin.\nSpeaking at an X Takeover event, Musk said that, \"I do think there's some merit in Bitcoin and maybe some of the other crypto,\" adding, \"I sort of have a soft spot for Dogecoin, because I just like dogs and meme... byStephen Graves·2 min read Markets Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog that inspired the original Doge meme, passed away in May—but her legacy lives on in the crypto world as the inspiration behind leading meme coin Dogecoin and a slew of spiritual successors. Now the owner of Kabosu has adopted a new dog, and the rush by crypto users to capitalize on the opportunity is causing a heap of drama.\nOn Saturday, the owner of Kabosu announced that she had adopted Neiro, a 10-year-old rescue Shiba Inu. Quickly, all hell broke loose on Crypto Twit... byRyan S. Gladwin·5 min read Technology Elon Musk’s Twitter (aka X) is making more and more changes: A special Bitcoin emoji tied to a hashtag has been removed from the social media platform just as the world’s biggest crypto conference, Bitcoin 2024, kicks off in Nashville. But it appears to be part of a broader move to get away from what Musk recently described as \"special hashtags.\"\nPreviously, users could type the hashtag “#Bitcoin” and the logo of the biggest cryptocurrency would appear alongside it. That now doesn’t work—and the... byMat Di Salvo·3 min read Coins It feels like a daily occurrence that someone gets rug pulled investing in a silly meme coin. More often than not, the investor laughs it off and moves onto the next Pump.fun token. It makes you question, though: Do crypto degens even care about being scammed?\nLogically, people don’t invest money if they think they’re going to lose money on a meme coin—no matter how degenerate you are. But, once it becomes apparent that the project is a scam, and the rug has been pulled from beneath them, the in... byRyan S. Gladwin·5 min read Business It appears that Twitter (aka X) users will not be able to use the platform to send or receive cryptocurrencies, at least not any time soon.\nCrypto enthusiasts have long speculated as to whether Elon Musk—a major proponent of the Dogecoin meme coin—would integrate digital tokens into the platform as he aims to build an “everything app.” However, new regulatory documents show that while Musk is indeed moving to launch a payments service, it does not appear to have crypto in its sights, per Bloombe... byNathan Reiff·2 min read Markets Volatility in the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin today didn’t substantially affect most traders, as each of the three cryptocurrencies ended up roughly where they started by Monday evening. But price spikes along the way appear to have triggered a wave of crypto liquidations—over $290 million worth across the market. \nEthereum led the pack, with about $58.9 million worth of liquidations triggered by ETH’s price movement in the last 24 hours, per data from CoinGlass. The majority of ET... bySander Lutz·2 min read Business Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino described payments functionality as a fast-approaching feature Monday, which she said will transform the way millions of users engage with each other on the platform also known as X.\n“We are actually redefining what users will come to rely on,” Yaccarino told The Female Quotient at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in France. “The scope of our vision, and the pace of the innovation at the company, is like nothing I can describe.”\nYaccarino was appo... byAndré Beganski·2 min read Business Elon Musk and Donald Trump are getting chummier—but they aren’t bonding over crypto just yet, according to the Tesla CEO. \nTech billionaire entrepreneur and electronic car extraordinaire Musk said Thursday that he and the former president have never talked about crypto policy, contrary to a Bloomberg report. \n“Pretty sure I’ve never discussed crypto with Trump, although I am generally in favor of things that shift power from government to the people, which crypto can do,” wrote Musk in response... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Markets Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\nIt’s been a wild week for crypto, with what many see as a complete 180-degree turn from the Securities and Exchange Commission when the regulator on Thursday approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC said yes to the likes of Grayscale, VanEck, Fidelity, and BlackRock after industry observers said for months that the products would not get approved.\nDespite the funds now making their way to the market, the price of the coin didn't move much on the ne... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Markets Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 5% on Friday following a tweet by Twitter (aka X) owner and long-time Dogecoin champion Elon Musk. The tweet honored the late Kabosu, the Shiba Inu behind the beloved Doge meme, who passed away on Friday.\nThe tweeted image also included Harambe, the lowland gorilla who was tragically killed in 2016 and became a meme icon.\nDogecoin is currently trading at $0.16, according to CoinGecko. DOGE started the day at $0.15 before surging to $0.17 following news of Kabosu’s death an... byJason Nelson·2 min read Coins The beloved Shiba Inu, Kabosu, who became a popular meme that eventually inspired the launch of Dogecoin in 2013, has passed away.\nHer owner, 62-year-old kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato, who lives in the city of Sakura in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, confirmed the news Friday in a blog post. She also wrote a poem about the dog's passing.\n\"At 7:50 a.m., I fell into a deep sleep,\" a translated copy of the poem says.\nIt was just this time last year that Own the Doge, a Doge-oriented NFT community back... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company.2024Decrypt Media, Inc.",

In “Hijacking Bitcoin: The Hidden History of BTC,” Ver asserts that the original vision of Bitcoin has been corrupted. Ver spoke with Decrypt about the current state of Bitcoin Cash and his respo... byJose Antonio Lanz·3 min read Coins Will the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash communities ever bury the hatchet?\nAdam Back, the CEO of Bitcoin company Blockstream and one of the earliest Bitcoin developers, today extended an olive branch to long-time rival Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin investor turned Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate.

Ethereum Classic is a smart contract platform and cryptocurrency. We explore its history and why it broke with Ethereum in 2016. The Landscape Over the past few years, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have become commonplace in cryptocurrency. Whether you discovered crypto through meme coins, NFTs, or DeFi, chances are you’ve interacted with a DAO somehow.\nDAOs are organizational structures for businesses or communities where control is spread via the distribution of tokens rather than hierarchy. They’re typically online communities focused on a specific goal.\nDAOs take many forms; some are light-hearted, like a group of s... byReza Jafery·6 min read Coins Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), has sold some of his Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) shares, according to a recent SEC filing.\nDCG is one of the largest crypto conglomerates on the market and counts Grayscale Investments, the trust’s issuer, as one of its subsidiaries.\nAccording to the filing, Silbert has moved to liquidate nearly 120,000 ETCG shares, worth an aggregate market value of approximately $755,295 dollars. This also appears to be the first t... byPedro Solimano·2 min read Coins As the crypto bear market continues to pull the price of digital assets lower, Ethereum Classic and Ravencoin, both potential post-merge havens for proof-of-work miners, are seeing double-digit losses.\nThe price of Ethereum Classic has fallen 23.4% in the week following the merge. The proof-of-work hardfork of the now proof-of-stake Ethereum saw the price of its coin drop from $38.93 on September 15, 2022, the day of the merge, to $29.39 today, according to data from CoinGecko.\nEthereum Classic'... byJason Nelson·2 min read Business After Ethereum’s successful merge, miners began switching their rigs to other blockchains.\nEthereum Classic (ETC), a hard fork of Ethereum executed following the 2016 DAO hack, saw its network hash jump nearly 300% from 66.54 terra hashes per second (TH/s) last night to 265.43 TH/s today, per data from 2miners.\nThe tremendous increase in hash rate can likely be attributed to the Ethereum merge earlier today. \nHash rate of ETH over the past 24 hours. Source: 2miners.\nAfter the merge, Ethereum no... bySujith Somraaj·2 min read Business As Ethereum’s long-awaited upgrade nears, miners appear to be switching their rigs over to Ethereum Classic. \nEthereum is set to end mining on its network tonight following the merge, which transitions the network to proof of stake. Meanwhile, the “original” Ethereum chain—Ethereum Classic, which forked back in 2016—has hit an all-time high hash rate of 65.49 terahashes per second (TH/s), according to 2miners.com data. \nHash rate refers to the computational power used to mine a cryptocurrency.

It could also reduce the risks of a so-called \"51% attack\" on ETC, which have been levied against the blockchain in the past.\nThe hash rate of the Ethereum Cla... byJason Nelson·4 min read Coins This week in coins. Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\nDespite the ongoing cypto bear market, many top cryptocurrencies posted double-digit percentage gains over the week. \nBitcoin had no such luck. Bitcoin only rose 5.5% over the last seven days and currently trades for $24,460 according to CoinMarketCap. \n\nEthereum rallied much harder. The No. 2 cryptocurrency and leading blockchain for high-functionality smart contracts is up 16% in the past week to $1,984 at the time of writing, a... byTim Hakki·4 min read Coins With anticipation building for the Ethereum merge next month, the price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) hit a four-month high of $42.29 per coin today, an increase of 15 percent in 24 hours, before settling slightly lower for the day, according to CoinMarketCap.\nEthereum Classic is a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain co-founded by Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood. While both Ethereum forks point to 2015 as their launch, the Ethereum blockchain was rolled back and relaunched in 2016 after the hack of... byJason Nelson·2 min read Coins As Ethereum takes its final steps toward the merge—the network’s much-hyped move to proof of stake—an influential crypto miner is looking to create a movement to resist that transition.\nChandler Guo, a well-known Chinese crypto miner, has launched a campaign to fork the Ethereum blockchain and create a spinoff, proof-of-work version, according to a Twitter post last week.\nIn Ethereum’s current proof-of-work model, so-called “miners” can generate ETH by directing huge amounts of computer power at... bySander Lutz·3 min read Coins Ethereum Classic, a non-forked version of Ethereum, is enjoying a hefty rally early Wednesday morning. \nFollowing the infamous DAO hack of 2016, Ethereum split into two blockchains: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and Ethereum Classic. The newly created chain is the currently used Ethereum network, and the hacked chain continues to operate as Ethereum Classic.\nImportantly, the latter will not be merging to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in Septem... bySujith Somraaj·2 min read The Coins Ethereum Classic is a smart contract platform and cryptocurrency. Ethereum Classic (ETC) shouldn’t be confused with Ethereum (ETH), even though they were the same until an argument led to divorce. Below we explore what led to the split.\nWhat is Ethereum Classic?\nEthereum Classic is very similar to Ethereum because it shares a common origin. It's a blockchain that allows other applications to be built atop it. These decentralized applications, or dapps, use code known as smart contracts so that p... byKi Chong Tran, Jeff Benson·5 min read Coins XRP and Ethereum Classic both blew up 10% today, despite a 0.52% drop in the global market capitalization of cryptocurrencies.\nXRP commands $59.13 billion of crypto’s $2.10 trillion global market cap, making it the seventh-largest cryptocurrency, according to data aggregator Nomics. It trades at a price of $1.27, having blown up 10.19% overnight. It peaked at $1.32 on Sunday, its highest price since May.\n\nXRP’s rally has been building momentum over the last few days. On Friday it posted a 6% inc... byTim Hakki·2 min read Markets The wider cryptocurrency market continued to rise for a second straight day, with Ethereum Classic surging and Dfinity’s Internet Computer token again posting some of the largest gains.\nEthereum Classic (ETC), the cryptocurrency that split from the larger Ethereum blockchain following the infamous The DAO hack in 2016, is up more than 31% over the last 24 hours, data from CoinGecko shows, to a current price of $57, with its seven-day price increase topping 41%.\nOn Monday, Ethereum Classic develo... byAndrew Hayward·3 min read Coins Digital Currency Group (DCG) on Monday announced it would buy $50 million worth of ETCG—a stock owned by its subsidiary, Grayscale, that is a proxy for owning Ethereum Classic.\n\"DCG plans to use cash on hand to fund the purchases and will make the purchases on the open market, at management’s discretion,\" said the company in a statement announcing the purchase.\n\nGrayscale is best known for its flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which owns a massive amount of Bitcoin that it has packa... byJeff John Roberts·3 min read Coins Barely a week after setting its former all-time high of $44.80, Ethereum Classic has more than trebled in value. At 7 pm yesterday, the coin set an ATH of $157.30.\nThough the price has since dipped to $142.18, Ethereum Classic has bulldozed its way into the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. \n\nAt the start of the year, ETC was worth between $5 and $6. The coin has since steadily grown in value, but the bulk of its explosive price movement occurred over the past week.\nToday, the co... byTim Hakki·3 min read Coins Ethereum Classic’s price surged overnight, sending the token into uncharted territory. In the last week, it has demolished its April 15 high of $38.43, ascending all the way to $97.24 today, according to data from Nomics. \nBut, depending on the exchange you use, you might be paying a lot more. On Coinbase, the price went as high as $149.75 before settling down into the $127 range—a full $35 more than on Binance and $12 more than on trading app Robinhood. \nWhile the large price discrepancy is lik... byJeff Benson·4 min read Coins While the global market capitalization of cryptocurrencies took a 0.22% hit today, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has come out on top, surging 12.23% to reach an all-time high price of $44.80.\nMeanwhile in a show of camaraderie, Ethereum (ETH) is also weathering the storm. It’s up 1.5% to trade at $2,877 a coin, no doubt hungrily chasing its own all-time high of $3,000. \nEthereum… Classic?!\nEthereum Classic is the original version of Ethereum. Ethereum, the more popular blockchain, forked from Ethereum... byTim Hakki·4 min read DeFi This isn’t a bridge to nowhere. \nEthereum Classic users will now have the option of a new bridge to the $13 billion DeFimarket with the launch of Wrapped Ethereum Classic tokens (WETC). \nETC users, who were previously unable to access the full array of non-custodial financial services available to ETH users, will now be able to stake their ETC holdings to gain entry into the world of decentralized finance, which currently exists predominantly on Ethereum.\n\nThe launch of WETC is aimed to provide... byNoah Zuss·4 min read Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company.2024Decrypt Media, Inc.",

Monero is a cryptocurrency designed to keep transactions hidden from prying eyes. It uses a number of sophisticated techniques to prevent people tracking how money is spent. As a result it has become increasingly popular with users of the dark net. Markets Privacy coin Monero is falling, dropping nearly 7% over the last 24 hours after Kraken announced its delisting in Europe.\nKraken—one of the world’s oldest crypto exchanges—informed users that it will delist Monero for clients in the European Economic Area (EEA) due to regulatory changes.\nTrading and deposits of all Monero markets will halt on Oct. 31 for EEA clients, and any open orders will be automatically closed. The deadline for withdrawing Monero is Dec. 31, and the remaining balances after... byAdrian Zmudzinski·3 min read Markets A Monero committee member has refuted recent allegations based on a leaked Chainalysis presentation to the IRS that implies the privacy-focused cryptocurrency can be traced.\nMonero (XMR) is the world’s most popular privacy coin and is specifically built to hide the addresses and transactions of those on its network.\nPrivacy coins have become popular for use cases that require a high degree of anonymity.

Gladwin·2 min read Coins Following Binance’s February announcement that it would delist Monero (XMR) and its finalization later that month, the exchange has now announced its last steps to get the privacy coin off its platform.\nIn an August 12 blog post, Binance said it will convert the balances of 15 different tokens, including XMR, to USD Coin (USDC) on Sept. 2, 2024. The conversion will be complete and the USDC will be in users’ wallets by Mar. 1, 2025.\nThe announcement explains that the conversion rate for the asset... byAdrian Zmudzinski·3 min read Coins Bitcoin is still the cryptocurrency that is ‘most abused’ by criminals, despite the introduction of privacy coins such as Monero, according to a new report from the Europol Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment.\nThe report found that Bitcoin (BTC) is the asset most demanded by ransomware groups for their payment—presumably due to the ease with which non-savvy users can procure Bitcoin over assets like Monero (XMR).\nStill, criminals tend to convert Bitcoin to stablecoins to avoid market vola... byAdrian Zmudzinski·5 min read Law and Order A British man was convicted of selling deadly weight loss pills, and £15,000 (about $19,350) worth of Monero was “seized” from him by the Cheshire Cyber Crime Unit. Later, the Food Standards Agency sold the tokens for British pounds in what's been described as the first UK Monero cryptocurrency payout.\nMonero is one of the largest privacy coins that hides the addresses and transactions of those on its network. Thus, it has become a popular token for people to use when they don’t want their activ... byRyan S. Gladwin·3 min read Law and Order A new report from the EU has singled out Bitcoin's Lightning Network and other layer 2 solutions as \"data obfuscation\" technologies that could be \"abused by criminals.\"\nThe First Report on Encryption by the EU Innovation Hub for Internal Security, a \"collaborative network of innovation labs\" from across EU member states, argues that alongside technologies including Mimblewimble, zero-knowledge (zk) proofs, coin mixers and privacy coins such as Monero and Zcash, \"layer 2 solutions such as the lig... byStephen Graves·2 min read Coins A Mexican teenager is lured into a web of cross-border crime with tragic consequences, in George Nicholas’ Monero-backed short film “Límite.”\nThe film follows 16-year-old Manuel, whose desire to assert his independence and face down neighborhood toughs draws him out of his grandfather’s orbit and into the clutches of a cartel drug-running operation.\nDirector George Nicholas was inspired by the case of Cruz Velazquez Acevedo, who died in U.S. custody after customs agents coerced him into drinking... byStephen Graves·5 min read Coins Monero-based peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange LocalMonero is shutting down, the platform announced in a blog post.\nCiting \"a combination of internal and external factors,\" LocalMonero stated that it would be \"winding down\" its exchange after almost seven years of operation.\nThe project is immediately disabling all new sign-ups and ad postings.

The exchange's former CEO, Chanpeng Zhao, faces investigation by the United States and has been subjected to travel restrictions, desp... byJose Antonio Lanz·4 min read Markets Privacy coin Monero (XMR) has shot up again after experiencing a plunge following news that crypto exchange Binance would delist the controversial coin.\nXMR is now priced at $130.54, according to CoinGecko, up more than 23% in the past day.\nIt hasn't erased its post-Binance losses, however, and over a seven-day period is still down 21%. Zooming out further, and XMR is hurting bad over the month, having shaved off nearly 15% of its value in 30 days.\nThe world's biggest crypto exchange Binance ann... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Coins Binance will delist privacy coin Monero (XMR) along with a handful of other assets on February 20, the company said in a blog post Tuesday morning.\nThe XMR price dropped 17% on the news and is currently trading for $138.00, according to CoinGecko data.

Csilla Brimer said that investigators were likely able to trace some transactions because of faulty operational security on the part of users, rathe... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Business Crypto exchange Binance has added a \"monitoring tag\" to a list of cryptocurrencies including privacy coins Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), Horizen (ZEN) and Firo (FIRO).\nIn an announcement, Binance said that tokens with the monitoring tag \"exhibit notably higher volatility and risks compared to other listed tokens,\" and are \"at risk of no longer meeting our listing criteria\" and being delisted from the exchange.\nIt added that tokens with the monitoring tag are subject to regular reviews. Criteria con... byStephen Graves·4 min read Business Cybersecurity company Kaspersky reported that ransomware negotiations and payments may soon come to rely less on Bitcoin as a means of payment.\nThe Russian-founded firm attributed this transition to improvements in the technology that detects the flow and sources of Bitcoin, as well as increased sanctions and market regulation. \nThe firm added that cybercriminals will instead look towards other digital currencies to facilitate their illicit payments. \nWith the price of crypto dropping, threat ac... byWill McCurdy·3 min read Technology Popular privacy coin Monero (XMR) completed a hard fork introducing new privacy and security features over the weekend.\nThe non-contentious hard fork, completed at block 2,688,888, was first announced by developers in April this year.

At its heart is a payment system that allows money to move across borders more cheaply and quickly than existing systems. DeFi With the launch of the Soroban smart contract platform on Stellar, developers are rushing to create decentralized apps (dapps) and platforms within the Stellar ecosystem.\nAmong the first to launch is the Phoenix DeFi Hub, which aims to be the “one-stop shop” for decentralized finance (DeFi) on Stellar, its creators told Decrypt.\n“We're going to be launching a bunch of DeFi protocols that all synergize with each other and drive value,” said Phoenix Marketing Director Griffin Williams.

In fact, the last time XLM traded above 50 cents was back around the time it reached its all-time high of 93 cents back in January 2018.\n\nStellar co-founder and CTO Jed McCaleb is surely doubly happy this morning.

The value of a single Stellar, or XLM, is now $0.08.\n\nThe price hike could perhaps be attributed to Thursday's announcement that USDC, the US dollar-pegged stablecoin led by Coinbase and Circle, will integrate with the Stellar blockchain at the start of next year.\n\nAnnouncing Circle's USDC support for Stellar across its suite of payments infrastructure APIs an... byDecrypt Staff·2 min read Coins USDC, the US dollar-pegged stablecoin managed by Circle and Coinbase, is coming to the Stellar blockchain, Circle announced today. \nCircle will add USDC support to Stellar’s vast array of products, among them payments tools, infrastructure APIs and business accounts products, by the first quarter of next year.

Here's how it works. Markets Asset manager Grayscale has launched a fund giving investors exposure to AAVE, the token behind the Ethereum-centric decentralized lending protocol Aave and the 44th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap.\nThe Grayscale Aave Trust allows investors to buy shares that track the price of the asset. It will operate like a closed-end fund, not an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that Grayscale offers Bitcoin and Ethereum investors following SEC approvals this year.\n\"Grayscale Aave Trust gives investors expos... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read DeFi The Aave community is evaluating a proposal to integrate Coinbase's upcoming Bitcoin wrapper, cbBTC, into its V3 protocol. \nThe potential connection between a centralized exchange and a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform has ignited a debate about the future of DeFi and the balance between innovation and decentralization.\nThe proposal from the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) would link cbBTC to both the Base network and Ethereum mainnet. The plan includes an incentive package of $150,000 over thre... byMurtuza Merchant·2 min read DeFi The team behind World Liberty Financial, an upcoming crypto project promoted by the Trump family, said Wednesday that the DeFi platform aims to maintain global U.S. dollar supremacy through the use of stablecoins.\nThe revelation comes after CoinDesk reported that a leaked white paper for the project details a borrowing and lending platform reminiscent of Dough Finance, a recently hacked protocol. The report suggested that World Liberty Financial hails from multiple Dough team members, and would... byRyan S. Gladwin·3 min read Markets As the crypto market looks to recover from a treacherous couple of weeks, altcoins have seen a healthy rebound.\nMost notably, layer-1 network Sui has jumped 5.3% on the day to $0.72 while crypto lending protocol Aave climbed 4.5% to $86.60.\nThis comes after significant selling pressure mounting on the market in recent weeks. The German government started to offload over $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin seized as the result of criminal cases. During this, defunct exchange Mt. Gox has been preparing... byRyan S. Gladwin·2 min read Technology Lens Protocol, a crypto-powered social media platform built by the Aave Companies, is rolling out several key features in its latest update.\nNotably, V2 will let Lens users finally block one another on-chain, much like on Web2 equivalent Twitter.

Kelly·2 min read DeFi Decrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\nLaunching a token is a delicate task.\nOn the one hand, you’ll thrill your die-hard audience of early adopters, rewarding them for sticking it out for so long.\nOn the other, you invite hungry whales to come and harvest your project for its incentives, often hogging the lion’s share of the tokens being dished out (before flipping them for a profit shortly after).\nThis latter outcome is especially bad if these tokens also ser... byLiam J. Kelly·5 min read DeFi Decrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\nThis past week we got two examples of when self-executing proposals go wrong for DAOs.\nOne proposal on Aave resulted in roughly $110 million in assets freezing after the proposal passed, and another on Tornado Cash saw a crafty proposer make off with roughly 372 ETH, worth over $670,000.\nThe Aave proposal has been fixed, and a new proposal executed the fix. As for Tornado Cash, the proposer has made a new proposal to retur... byLiam J. Kelly·4 min read DeFi First proposed in November 2021, Aave’s latest upgrade is finally here.\nLaunched earlier this month, V3 of the DeFi lending protocol has already raked in more than $143 million across the first seven assets listed.\nThough the asset list is far shorter than the previous iteration, the project’s founder and CEO Stani Kulechov says this upgrade is all about managing risk.\nWhy Aave v3's New Portal Feature Could Be a Game-Changer\n“The DeFi space itself has been growing significantly, so we’ve seen mo... byLiam J.

Genesis services the exchange's Earn product.\nThere are two likely reasons that these rates would spike above 50%.\nThe first is that speculators are attempting to short the asset. Second, liquidity may be fleeing the pool and being converted to an... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Business Despite Elon Musk's recent takeover of Twitter, Aave co-founder and CEO Stani Kulechov believes the microblogging platform won't be on the blockchain anytime soon. \nOn the latest episode of Decrypt’s gm podcast, Kulechov spoke about the greater role he expects Web3 to play in social media and outlined his vision for Lens Protocol, a blockchain-based social mediaverse where users can retain and import their social capital across various platforms. \nKulechov defined “social capital” as “followers... byTim Hakki·3 min read DeFi Following a three-day voting period, Aave community members approved Matter Labs' proposal to deploy the decentralized lending protocol Aave on its Ethereum scaling product zkSync.\nMatter Labs is the development team behind the layer-2 scaling solution.\nNearly all voters supported the proposal, while a mere 0.02% abstained. More than 561,000 Aave governance tokens (AAVE) were used in the voting process.\n\nHowever, the approved proposal is to deploy Aave to zkSync’s testnet.

It’s always been possible to do that by first depositing ETH and borrowing stETH from the Lido protocol, then going to another platform, like Aave, to loan stETH in exchange for ETH again. But Oasis will allow users with ETH to enter into the recursive strategy in a single tra... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Business Trading app RobinHood has added cryptocurrencies Tezos (XTZ) and Aave (AAVE), allowing users to buy and sell the tokens on its platform.\nThe company tweeted the announcement on Monday, linking to a web page showing crypto that has been newly listed on Robinhood.\nTezos is a proof-of-stake blockchain network, while Aave is a decentralized lending protocol.

With the price of Bitcoin breaking even for the year, the crypto market rally has also led to millions in liquidated short positions. \nAccording to data pulled from Coi... byLiam J.

Journalists who report basic facts are accused of spreading \"FUD,\" they get hammered for perceived biases, and they must work in an Internet economy that often rewards speed over accuracy.\nThey also get arrested, beat up, and even killed for trying to reveal the truth. According to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, on-the-job journalist arrests increased 1200% in the U.S. in 2020, while twenty-one journalists worldwide were murdered because of their work. \nT... byJeff Benson·3 min read Coins Filecoin (FIL) is on the rise.

Filecoin has the 21st largest market cap out of all cryptocurrencies. \n\nFilecoin’s rise today comes amid stagnancy or mild decay for other top coins.

Here’s what you need to know. Farcaster leverages blockchain technology to provide a framework on which multiple social media apps can be built. DeFi Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has unveiled Ink, an Ethereum-based layer-2 blockchain powered by Optimism's OP Stack. \nInk will offer on-chain wealth management tools for seasoned digital asset traders and crypto-curious clients, Kraken said Thursday in a joint statement with the Optimism Collective. The network, which rolls out on testnet in November, will be interoperable with Optimism's Superchain, a network of layer-2s that share security and infrastructure.\n“As part of the Superchain, Ink i... byLiz Napolitano·2 min read Technology Worldcoin, newly rebranded World—the crypto-fueled, eyeball-scanning identity platform co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman—launched the mainnet for its own Ethereum layer-2 network called World Chain on Thursday.\nWorld Chain is rolling out with the goal of bringing millions of verifiable human users onto the blockchain, in addition to promoting the development of digital identity tools and applications that promote financial freedom, its core team told Decrypt.\nMany blockchains are dominated by... byLiz Napolitano·3 min read Gaming Legendary game developer CCP Games this week lifted the lid on Eve Frontier, a space survival game set in the Eve Online universe that features blockchain integration. \nInitially referred to as Project Awakening, Eve Frontier appears to have a lot of similarities to the massive Eve Online game, but with more of a survival focus—and the ability to use crypto tokens and blockchain code to impact and reshape the game in new ways.\nDetails are still a little thin on the ground, but with such a presti... byMike Stubbs·6 min read Gaming Eve Online creator CCP Games announced Thursday that its upcoming survival-centric blockchain game, previously referred to as Project Awakening, will launch as Eve Frontier instead—and that it’s being built within the Ethereum ecosystem.\nEve Frontier, as it has been rebranded, is an on-chain space simulation game that players will be able to mold and expand as they see fit—and they must collaborate or face certain doom, CCP Games founder and CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson told Decrypt’s GG earlier... byAndrew Hayward·3 min read Technology Sony Group has finally pulled back the curtain on Soneium, an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain developed in partnership with Web3 infrastructure provider Startale.\nDriven by a joint venture between Sony and Startale—known as Sony Block Solutions Labs—Soneium marks the company's initial steps towards developing a fully realized blockchain.\nThe network, planned for launch in the coming weeks, will initially operate on a testnet in collaboration with Astar Network, a blockchain platform known for its mu... bySebastian Sinclair·4 min read Markets Rumors of a potential approval of Ethereum spot ETFs have fueled a full day of gains for the Ethereum ecosystem, with the price of ETH skyrocketing 20% intraday to just shy of $3,700—trading at $3,687 at time of writing—and sister tokens Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) both notching gains of 18% on Monday.\nThe optimistic mood had already spread to other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), which are peaking above $40 and $188 respectively, as of this writing, represent... byRyan Ozawa·3 min read Gaming Redstone, a new Ethereum scaling network designed for fully on-chain games and “autonomous worlds,” launched its mainnet today—with a number of early games already available for play.\nDeveloped by Ethereum startup Lattice, Redstone was built via Optimism’s OP Stack scaling tech. But it’s much more than a rebranded riff on the layer-2 tech that also powers networks like Base and Zora—Redstone has been significantly retooled for the needs and demands of video games, particularly those that use blo... byAndrew Hayward·6 min read DeFi The on-chain competition is always watching, but sometimes it will be compelled to help.\nOffchain Labs, the core team behind the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Arbitrum, recently uncovered several security issues in a testnet version of Optimism, a separate Ethereum layer-2 scaling network created by OP Labs.\nAfter fixes were implemented, the issues were detailed Friday in a blog post published by Offchain Labs co-founder Ed Felton. As the potential vulnerability was found in Optimism’s system... byAndré Beganski·3 min read Technology Heralded by Ethereum developers as the technical milestone they’d been “dreaming of,” last week’s Dencun upgrade was supposed to forever alter the Ethereum ecosystem—by making transactions on its layer-2 networks exponentially cheaper and thus more accessible. \nOne week later, how do things stand? \nOn the whole, Dencun has delivered exactly as promised. Across layer-2 networks that have already integrated the software update, gas fees have plummeted to unprecedented lows, in most cases by over 9... bySander Lutz·4 min read Markets Just hours to go until the Dencun upgrade goes live on Ethereum mainnet, the tokens of layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon have all seen hefty gains.\nArbitrum is the only one to have seen double-digital gains as the Ethereum community counts down the minutes to Dencun. Its ARB token has risen 11% in the past day and 7.5% compared to this time last week. ARB rose as high as $2.25 early Wednesday morning, but has since settled to $2.20 at the time of writing.\nArbitrum is... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Technology It’s been a wild 10 days for decentralized social media startup Farcaster, which catapulted from relative obscurity to crypto industry darling last week after debuting a novel feature for independent developers. \nOvernight, activity on the network increased exponentially, dramatically broadening its reach. That growth caught many in the industry by surprise—including Farcaster’s leadership. \n\n(Video by Rug Radio Creator Benjamin White.)\n“We thought it was going to be popular,” Farcaster co-found... bySander Lutz·4 min read The Projects Farcaster is a decentralized social media protocol built with a focus on interoperability, user autonomy, and privacy.\nLeveraging blockchain technology, it aims to solve the prevalent issues of censorship, privacy breaches, and centralization that plague traditional social media platforms. But what sets Farcaster apart in the crowded space of decentralized applications (dapps)?\n\n(Video by Rug Radio Creator Benjamin White.)\nTechnical underpinnings\n\nBlockchain Basis: At its core, Farcaster runs on... byIlan Hazan, Benjamin White·4 min read Technology In the last two years—particularly, since Elon Musk’s divisive purchase and overhaul of Twitter in late 2022—a number of upstart decentralized social media protocols have attempted to harness the transparent, uncensorable power of blockchain networks to improve the online social experience.\nFarcaster is the latest such project to do so. Now, it’s making waves after releasing a key update that has attracted thousands of new users in a matter of days. Here's why Crypto Twitter is so optimistic abo... bySander Lutz·5 min read Business Four months after departing Polygon Labs, Ryan Wyatt is joining the team supporting a totally different Ethereum scaling network: Optimism.\nOn Monday, the former Polygon Labs president was announced as the Chief Growth Officer for Optimism Unlimited, a newly created subsidiary of the Optimism Foundation. Wyatt will build a team to support adoption and development on Optimism across a variety of functions, including business development, marketing, partnerships, and beyond.\nAhead of the announcem... byAndrew Hayward·4 min read Markets Monday’s carnage in the crypto market on Monday caused the market cap of Arbitrum to slip below that of rival project Optimism.\nArbitrum’s governance token ARB dropped to a new all-time low of $0.745, according to data from CoinGecko, while Optimism’s OP token gained 6.8% in the past 24 hours to trade at $1.33. Currently, ARB has recovered some of its losses and is trading at $0.782, at par with yesterday’s price.\nThe flipping of the two projects’ market caps occurred due to considerable liquida... byNivesh Rustgi·2 min read DeFi Continuing the trend, another decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol bridge has been hacked, according to the project and various security firms.\nExactly, a credit market on the Optimism network, said early Friday that it was “actively investigating a security issue within our protocol.” It added that the protocol was temporarily paused, but users could still withdraw assets. \nSecurity firm PeckShield said on Twitter that it had “detected an ongoing attack.” Furthermore, blockchain security firm... byMat Di Salvo·3 min read Technology DeFi blockchain explorer platform DeBank has announced DeBank Chain, a new layer-2 blockchain built on Optimism’s OP Stack.\nBilled as an “asset later for social,” DeBank Chain is built as an optimistic rollup which claims to have reduced the “L1 data storage gas cost by 100 to 400 times.” The OP Stack is a blockchain development standard by Optimism team on which new layer-2 blockchains can be built.\nDeBank, a DeFi portfolio visualisation and blockchain explorer platform for Ethereum and other E... byNivesh Rustgi·2 min read NFTs The crypto community has, historically, adorned certain male founders with reputations so epic they verge on myth—from Zeus-like Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, to hero-turned-villain Sam Bankman-Fried, and his once-friend and now nemesis, the ever-mysterious Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.\nStill, none of them have yet been equated, in a rousing Eurodisco dance track, to the Empire-ending, mythically well-endowed Russian mystic and holy man Rasputin. That changed this week with “V Buterin,” a sing... bySander Lutz·3 min read DeFi Decrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\nA layer-2 airdrop and two mainnet launches has the market clamoring for more scaling action.\nOn March 23, Arbitrum finally distributed its highly-anticipated ARB token, decentralizing its inventory into the hands of its most dedicated users. The hype was so fierce, though, that it took down the project’s main website as well as that of Arbiscan—Arbitrum’s Etherscan equivalent—because eligible wallets could claim their aird... byLiam J. Kelly·4 min read Coins There’s a new layer-2 token in town.\nArbitrum recently announced the launch and airdrop of its native governance token called ARB. The token has yet to be distributed, with the developer team indicating ARB will hit eligible wallets on March 23.\nThat’s left plenty of time for armchair token valuations as the Crypto Twitterati mulls how much those new tokens could be worth.\nAccording to some analysts, Optimism's OP token is a good starting place for estimating ARB token valuations.

But instead of building it from scratch, it’s gone out and bought one.\nThe popular Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX) announced the acquisition of Vortex Protocol today for an undisclosed amount.\nBuilt atop Sei Network, a blockchain using Cosmos’ tooling, the on-chain trading platform will come under the SushiSwap umbrella as another product and will take a new name.\nWhy Some SushiSwap Stakers Are... byLiam J. Kelly·2 min read Coins This week in coins. Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\nDespite the ongoing cypto bear market, many top cryptocurrencies posted double-digit percentage gains over the week. \nBitcoin had no such luck. Bitcoin only rose 5.5% over the last seven days and currently trades for $24,460 according to CoinMarketCap. \n\nEthereum rallied much harder.

In the last 24 hours, it has increased by 12.5%, and in the previous week, ATOM has seen a price hike of 42.2%. \nOSMO, a fast-growing decentralized exchange (DEX), is having similar luck.

In terms of growth, though, UST has enjoyed impressive upwards momentum of late. \nIn the last thirty days, the market cap of Terra’s UST stablecoin has grown by over 90%. \nCompare that to DAI’s 3% gro... byTim Hakki·3 min read Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company.2024Decrypt Media, Inc.",

Markets Meme coins on Solana are some of the biggest losers over the past week as token launchpad Pump.fun fell out of favor, with the category as a whole dropping by 21.7% on the week, per data from CoinGecko.\nOn Saturday, Pump.fun was responsible for 5,388 new tokens created on Solana, according to Dune data. To put this into perspective, just three weeks ago the protocol peaked, deploying 20,465 tokens.\nWith Pump.fun statistics falling, so have the prices of some major tokens created by the protocol.... byRyan S. Gladwin·2 min read Markets Meme coins are soaring while Bitcoin takes a heavy hit amid selling pressure from the German government and Mt. Gox refunds.\nMost significantly, BONK has jumped 12% over the past 24 hours. That’s seen BONK edge past Dogwifhat (WIF) as it fell 3%, making it the largest Solana meme coin by market capitalization.\nSimilarly, Base chain meme coin Brett (BRETT) leaped 8.6%, Ethereum-based Mog Coin (MOG) climbed 6%, and Apu Apustaja (APU) soared 15%. Despite this the tokens are still down over the week... byRyan S. Gladwin·2 min read Markets Meme coins are performing well amid a broader market lull, with Base chain token Brett leading the pack.\nWhile industry leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum are largely unmoved over the past 24 hours, Brett (BRETT) jumped 7%, Pepe (PEPE) leaped 6%, and Bonk (BONK) climbed 4%. This puts them all in the top six gainers out of the top 100 tokens by market capitalization with Brett in first place.\nThe token on Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 network also leads the pack for gains over the past week surging a hug... byRyan S. Gladwin·2 min read Coins Bitcoin and Ethereum may have slowed down, but top meme tokens are riding high today.\nSolana-based Dogwifhat (WIF) is leading the charge, having jumped by 11%. It's now priced at $3.68. Meanwhile, Bonk is up by over 6% and is now trading hands for $0.00004148, CoinGecko shows.\nEvery Dog Coin Has Its Day: Dogecoin Hits Highest Price Since 2022 Amid Bitcoin Bull Run\nFLOKI has also made notable gains—having surged by 9%: its price now stands at $0.0002953.\nZooming out, all three assets have boomed... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read The Coins Born out of the wreckage left behind by the collapse of FTX in November 2022, BONK is a meme coin aimed at bringing together the Solana community.\nIn December 2023, a BONK boom saw the cryptocurrency's market cap surge to over $1 billion, causing Solana Saga smartphones to sell out after savvy traders realized that the BONK airdrop bundled with the phones was worth more than the devices themselves.\nBut what exactly is this dog coin all about? What makes it special? How does it work? And what eve... byRyan S. Gladwin·5 min read Markets Bitcoin is trading at $63,330, representing a -1.5% dip in the last 24 hours as it recovers from a dip last week. The rest of the crypto market is following suit, and meme coins are also suffering. They post big gains when markets are green, but bleed hard when bears take over.\nSolana-based Dogwifhat (WIF) is the only meme coin in the top 100 of the largest cryptocurrencies that is posting gains today, edging up from $3.20 to $3.36, marking a 2.75% spike in the last 24 hours. The coin is current... byJose Antonio Lanz·3 min read Markets The global crypto market cap stands at $2.29 trillion, marking a 3.50% increase over the last day, according to CoinMarketCap. Excluding stablecoins, 96% of the Top 100 tokens are registering gains, leaving only LEO, Gnosis, Axelar, and Celestia in bearish territory with less than 1.2% in losses.\nThat closes out the week with at least one bullish day, as Bitcoin is also up over 4% in the last 24 hours and above $61,800 at time of writing, CoinGecko data shows.\nThere are also 64 top coins that ar... byJose Antonio Lanz·4 min read Coins Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\nBitcoin's movements have been unremarkable this week, weakly wavering seven days after its long-anticipated halving event—but one category of crypto has come out winning: meme coins.\nOver the past week, Bonk has made the biggest gains, according to CoinGecko data. The Solana-based token is up 58%.\nThe reason for the dog coin's rise is in part due to the Bonk DAO approving a proposal to burn over 278 billion Bonk tokens—seen as a bullish move because... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Markets Bitcoin may have dipped from its new all-time high it hit yesterday—but smaller cap meme coins and tokens are up big.\nThe biggest winner is Dogwifhat (WIF), which is up nearly 34% in 24 hours and is priced at $3.21, CoinGecko data shows at time of writing.\nAnd Pepe (PEPE), which came into existence last year, is up slightly more than 13%, making it the second biggest gainer in the past day.\nSolana-based meme Bonk (BONK) has also made gains, jumping by nearly 10%.\nWhy Most Meme Coins Die Young\nBi... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Markets With a crypto market surge propelling Bitcoin to $65,000, just 6% below its all-time high, meme coins like PepeCoin, Dogecoin, and BONK are following in its wake with double-digit gains on the day.\nOf the meme coins in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, frog-themed PEPE is leading the charge, up 35.6% over the past 24 hours and a massive 421.8% over the past seven days. That's enough to have made it the 44th largest digital asset by market capitalization, according to CoinGec... byDecrypt Staff·2 min read Markets The crypto markets are sizzling, but it's the dog-themed meme coins like BONK, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu that are stealing the show, with massive gains in the last 24 hours.\nAs Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies experience a bullish surge, the meme coin phenomenon has grabbed some of the spotlight.\nIn an industry known for its volatility and unpredictability, memecoins have emerged as a unique and intriguing segment of the crypto landscape. And they can be the subject of some of the most int... byJose Antonio Lanz·4 min read Coins It's often true that digital assets go where Bitcoin leads them, but Pepecoin, BONK and Dogwifhat are overclocking for the meme coin segment.\nBut first, a very necessary disclaimer: Even the most popular meme coins can be extremely volatile. A token that's up one day can crash to zero the next. Investors should proceed with caution.\nAt the time of writing, Solana meme coin BONK has seen a 7% grain since yesterday. It's currently trading for $0.00001284—which is 27% higher than it was this time l... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Coins Hype surrounding Solana-based meme token Bonk (BONK) has died down. The meme coin is dropping in value and is worth nearly 22% less than it was seven days ago.\nThe dog-themed coin, which blew up this month, is currently priced at $0.00001492, according to CoinGecko. That's a 7.5% 24-hour drop.\nPerhaps even more indicative of waning investor interest is BONK's plunge since the all-time high it touched on December 15: it is now down by over 56%.\nAnd BONK's market cap is now sitting below the $1 bi... byMat Di Salvo·2 min read Markets Tokens for the decentralized mobile network Helium have boomed in the past day, with protocol token MOBILE leading the pack.\nMOBILE, a governance token mined by 5G-CBRS and Wi-Fi hotspots, is up over 60% on the day and a massive 821% on the week, currently trading at $0.00632984 per CoinGecko data. Helium's native cryptocurrency HNT is up 2.4%, trading at $7.39, while its IOT token, which underpins Helium's Internet of Things subnetworks, is up 11% over the past 24 hours.\nThe surge in Helium Net... byStephen Graves·2 min read Coins Solana meme coin BONK went from boom to blah, down 11% after Coinbase announced yesterday it would soon list the token on its exchange.\nBONK is currently trading for $0.00001051, according to CoinGecko. It did initially spike in price after the announcement from Coinbase, which led to the token surging 15%. But it was short-lived: The price later sank as low as 20%.\nThis comes a week after BONK set a new all-time high and flipped the Elon Musk-themed coin FLOKI.\nBest in Show? Solana's BONK Joins... byStacy Elliott·3 min read Coins To say dog-themed cryptocurrencies are popular is a bit of an understatement—in terms of just how prevalent they’ve become ever since Tesla founder Elon Musk first tweeted about Dogecoin in 2019.\nThe now-owner of Twitter famously said, “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency.” Years later, hundreds of dog-themed tokens are now vying for similar attention.\nAs one Reddit user recently pointed out, nearly all of the top 10 tokens under CoinGecko’s so-called meme section make some reference to man’... byAndré Beganski·4 min read Markets The developers behind Solana-based meme coin BONK burned their allocation of 5 trillion BONK tokens early Friday, in a bid to stem the token’s bearish momentum.\nAfter the token burn event, which saw nearly $1 million worth of BONK removed from circulation, BONK’s circulating supply shrunk 5% to 94.16 trillion, per data from Solana block explorer Solscan.\n\n$BONK represents the best of Solana.
