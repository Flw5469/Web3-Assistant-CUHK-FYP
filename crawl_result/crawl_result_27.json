    "news_content": "Learn all of the most important blockchain and cryptocurrency terms and jargon here. INTERMEDIATE Proof of stake is a method of validating cryptocurrency transactions. INTERMEDIATE If Bitcoinâs white paper is the foundational text for crypto, Web3 is the broader philosophy that has emerged from it. INTERMEDIATE NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are one-of-a-kind digital assets. BEGINNER Cryptocurrencies are often tied to ambitious blockchain projects that try to aspire to remake the worldâs financial and computer systems. But thereâs an entire class of cryptocurrencies that derive their value primarily from Internet jokes or popular culture: memecoins. ADVANCED Bitcoin isnât the only blockchainâthere are thousandsâand they arenât compatible. Enter bridges. INTERMEDIATE Solana is a popular blockchain that supports decentralized applications and tokens. ADVANCED Blockchains are composed of layers, a metaphor that helps explain how blockchains can take a load off each other. ADVANCED The most popular NFT project is called Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). INTERMEDIATE Cryptocurrencies are governed by a set of rules called \"tokenomics,\" which refers to the monetary policies baked into each token or coin. BEGINNER Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana, are digital assets that run on decentralized peer-to-peer networks called blockchains. BEGINNER Youâve heard the horror stories and many of them are true. INTERMEDIATE DeFi refers to a suite of decentralized financial applications built on blockchains. ADVANCED DEX is short for decentralized exchange, a cryptocurrency trading platform not maintained by a centralized company. BEGINNER The nuts and bolts of cryptocurrency investments are similar to those of other asset classes, like stocks or gold. INTERMEDIATE Staking refers to the locking up of cryptocurrency in order to help secure a network and earn rewards. INTERMEDIATE Smart contracts bring blockchains to life by letting users create and run on-chain programs. BEGINNER While stockbrokers trade on stock exchanges, cryptocurrency traders primarily buy and sell tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges. INTERMEDIATE Cardano is the name of the blockchain that houses ADA, a long-time, top-10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization. INTERMEDIATE XRP is a top-10 cryptocurrency that runs on the XRP Ledger, a blockchain network launched in 2012 by U.S.-incorporated payments company Ripple. BEGINNER Bitcoin is the first and largest cryptocurrency network. BEGINNER Blockchains are distributed computer networks that support cryptocurrencies. INTERMEDIATE Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency network by market capitalization after Bitcoin. INTERMEDIATE While the term âmetaverseâ once described an obscure fictional dystopia, today it refers to an all-encompassing virtual world in which users play, work, and socialize. INTERMEDIATE Proof of workâaka cryptocurrency miningâhas been around since the 1990s, but Bitcoinâs creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, popularized the concept in Bitcoinâs 2008 whitepaper as a process for securing blockchains. INTERMEDIATE While cryptocurrencies are notorious for their volatility, a cluster of them called stablecoins promises an escape from the chaos. ADVANCED Oracles are programs that feed smart contracts with real-world data. BEGINNER Cryptocurrency wallets safeguard digital assets like Bitcoin, Ether, or NFTs. INTERMEDIATE Avalanche is a newer blockchain network that competes with the likes of Ethereum and Solana. INTERMEDIATE USD Coin, also known as USDC, is a cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar.

While we have seen CD rates drop after the Fed cut rates on Sept. 18, some high-yield savings rates have held steady. In the short term, these rates should hold steady or slightly drop. However, future rate cuts may force banks to drop savings rates. It might be a good time to consider acertificate of deposit. You can lock in a rate with a CD and ensure a solid rate of return, as opposed to your savings account, which might see a steady rate decline. Major national banks generally offer minuscule APYs compared to some of the top institutions on our list. For example, Bank of America, Chase Bank, and Wells Fargo offer a measly APY of 0.01% on their savings accounts, whereas most of the options listed above are over 5%. Large banks donât rely on the money consumers deposit into their savings accounts the way smaller banks do. Huge financial institutions make their money from interest paid on loans, fees, and securities. Smaller banks and online fintechs are continuously looking for ways to draw in new customers, and offering competitive APYs on their deposit accounts is a great incentive. Additionally, online banks generally have fewer upfront costs, so they can offer better rates to their customers. That being said, a few major banks still offer decent rates on savings accounts. Here are several national banks and their savings account APYs as compared to the best on our list: Ahigh-yield savings accountworks just like atraditional savings account. Itâs a deposit account at a credit union or bank that you can use for saving and earning interest on your money. The main difference is that the high-yield savings account offers a much higher APY on the money you keep in your account. \"One trick I use is to have multiple high-yield savings accounts. Then, as rates fluctuate between them, I move my money around to the account with the best APY. This has helped me earn hundreds in interest over the years.\" The most recent rates from the FDIC put the national savings APY average at 0.46%, while there are many high-yield savings accounts that offer a 4.00% APY or higher. Some financial institutions charge a monthly fee to cover the administrative costs of providing a savings account. These fees can often be waived by meeting certain requirements, such as maintaining a minimum balance or linking a checking account. However, fees can easily wipe away your interest earnings, so choosing an account that charges minimal or no fees is important, if possible. You may be required to deposit a minimum amount of money to open a high-yield savings account. Depending on the account, the amount can range from $0 to $1,000 or more. Itâs also common for high-yield savings account rates to be tiered, meaning higher rates are available for higher balances. Always check the balance requirements of an account to find out if you need to meet a certain threshold to earn the advertised rate. When you deposit money in a high-yield savings account, your savings will grow thanks to the magic ofcompound interest. This means youâll earn interest on the principal balance in your account and any interest you earned previously. For example, if you deposited $100 in your account and earned $10 in interest over the past few months, you will earn interest on the entire $110. The APY on your account can and likely will fluctuate any time the Fed raises or decreases the federal funds rate. Thatâs the interest rate banks charge one another to borrow money, and your bank may be inclined to raise or lower rates on its financial products based on these changes. The interest youâd earn on a $10,000 deposit depends on the annual percentage yield and frequency of compounding. For example, if you deposited $10,000 into a high-yield savings account that earns 5% APYâand didnât make any other contributionsâyouâd have a total balance of $10,500 at the end of one year, assuming the interest compounds annually. If it compounds daily, youâd have a bit more: $10,512.67. The rate at which your interest compounds (daily, weekly, monthly, or annually) will depend on the financial institution. If youâre considering putting your money in a high-yield savings account, there are a few key benefits and drawbacks to be aware of.  One of the main advantages of high-yield savings accounts is that they typically offer interest rates well above the national average. Currently, the national average APY for a traditional savings account sits at 0.45%, whereas some of the high-yield accounts on our list boast rates as high as 5.00%. A high-yield savings account also provides greater security than some other investment options. Most high-yield accounts are FDIC- or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)-insured, meaning that your deposits are protected up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution in the event of abank failure. Meanwhile, you usually wonât earn as much in a savings account as you would by investing your money in the market, even with a high-yield account. Even so, high-yield savings accounts are sensitive to changes in the economy, which means that your APY can increase or decrease at the discretion of your bank. There may also be a cap on your monthly withdrawals. Your financial institution may limit the number of withdrawals you can make each month. You may be charged a fee for each additional transaction if you exceed the limit. High-yield savings accounts can be an effective savings vehicle for savers with many different types of goals. A fewcommon uses for high-yield saving accountsinclude: Choosing the right high-yield savings account will require you to think carefully about your financial habits, preferences, and goals so that you can select the account that best suits your needs. The APY is the interest you can expect to earn on the money you keep in your account for one year. While this percentage may fluctuate depending on your bank and the economy's health, youâll want to give your savings the greatest chance of growing and earning as much compound interest as possible. The FDIC regularly publishesaverage national ratesfor various accounts, including high-yield savings accounts, so this is a trustworthy resource to use when shopping around for rates. Ideally, a lucrative high-yield savings account will offer a savings rate of at least 10 times that rate. Many, but not all, high-yield savings accounts require a minimum deposit to open your account. This figure can vary widely across financial institutions, with some requiring no minimum deposit and others requiring a minimum deposit well into the thousands. If youâre a new saver, you may not be able to opt for an account requiring a higher minimum deposit. Certain accounts may chargefeesfor maintaining your account, transferring funds, and more. An excessive fee structure can eat into your balance if youâre not keeping close tabs on your account. Weigh the different fees you could become responsible for and determine if the perks that come with the account outweigh potential penalties down the line. Not all high-yield savings accounts will come with physical branch access or a large ATM network. If youâre looking for an account that will provide you with face-to-face support and easy access to your funds, double-check that the financial institution youâre considering banking with has locations and ATMs in your area. If you prefer to do your banking on your desktop or phone, explore the financial institutionâs online and mobile platforms before opening an account. Read Apple App Store and Google Play reviews to learn more about the digital platforms and tools available to you and what kinds of features and services are available on those platforms. Lastly, itâs important to know how to contact a representative if you have questions or issues related to your account. Some financial institutions take a digital-first approach and donât offer easy access to a real human. Others prefer a phone call over chat or email options. Make sure an accountâs customer service options align with how you like to communicate. Ready to open an account? Hereâs what to do: High-yield savings accounts differ from other types of deposit accounts in a few key ways: The primary difference between a high-yield savings account and a traditionalsavings accountlies in their interest rates. High-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts, which means that the money saved in a high-yield account grows faster. In some cases, high-yield accounts might come with more restrictions, such as limitations on the number of withdrawals and higher minimum balance requirements. High-yield savings accounts are similar to traditional savings accounts, with the key difference being that high-yield accounts typically offer a more generous APY. Theydiffer from CDsin that high-yield savings accounts preserve access to your funds, while CDs require that you commit to locking up your funds for a fixed term if you hope to avoid a penalty. High-yield savings accounts are similar toMMAsin that youâll earn interest on your balance and can easily access your funds. One key difference between the two account types is that you may need to deposit and maintain a certain balance to open an MMA and, in some cases, the higher the balance, the higher your rate may be. The Fortune Recommendsâ¢ team collaborated with industry leader Curinos to bring you savings accounts with the highest rates from around the country. The rates in this article only cover online and brick-and-mortar banks and do not include credit unions. For theeditors' picks, we compared more than 60 online savings accounts and specifically looked for accounts available to customers in the United States regardless of where theyâre located, subject to the terms of each account.Our methodologyranked each account in these core categories: Yes, if the account is at a bank or credit union insured by the FDIC or the NCUA, respectively. TheFDIC insures banksup to $250,000 per depositor, per bank, for each account ownership category. Credit unions are insured by the NCUA, which offers coverage up to $250,000 per share owner, per insured credit union, for each account ownership category. If you choose to use a high-yield savings account, you should be aware of the tax implications that come with it. The IRS considers interest earned on the money in your account taxable interest. Your financial institution will typically send you a 1099-INT statement for any interest earned over $10, and the amount you owe will depend on how much interest youâve earned and your tax bracket. Individual banks set savings rates loosely based on thefederal funds rateâthe interest rate that banks charge other banks when they lend one another money, usually overnight or for a few days. When theFed hikes rates, this can raise the cost of borrowing and motivate banks to raise their APYs to attract new customers. The interest rate is the percentage of your account balance that the bank pays you in interest over the course of a year, not factoring in the effects of compounding. APY, on the other hand, considers the interest compounding frequency. Therefore, APY gives you a more accurate picture of your actual earnings over a year. Perhaps the most inconvenient aspect of many high-yield savings accounts is the potential for withdrawal limits: Many banks restrict consumers to six withdrawals per month on a savings account. Other downsides include variable interest rates (they could change at any time), minimum opening deposits, fees, and limited growth compared to other savings options, like investments. Whatâs considered a âgoodâ rate is somewhat subjective. The national average savings account rate is 0.47%, so any rate above that would be considered above-average. However, some banks offer savings accounts that offer an APY that exceeds 4%. So, if youâre looking for a high-yield savings account, it pays to shop around to find the highest rates available. It's very unlikely that you'll lose money in a high-yield savings account. Make sure the financial institution you choose is insured through the FDIC (or the NCUA for a credit union)âthis way, in the rare case of a bank failure, your money is insured, up to $250,000 per person.

A customer can create up to 20 vaults with distinctions for specific savings goals, such as an emergency fund or vacation. This money is not technically in a separate account, itâs earmarked with whatever designation you give it, so it still earns the APY you receive based on your direct deposit amount.

SoFi members with Direct Deposit or $5,000 or more in Qualifying Deposits during the 30-Day Evaluation Period can earn 4.20% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances.

It's easy to find a savings account with over 5% interest, which might not be as high as stock market returns but, with no risk involved, you can't beat it.\" While we evaluated the above institutions based on multiple criteria, the earnings potential of a savings account is often the key factor of concern. Below are some of the highest-yield savings accounts based on APY. Each account is backed by theFDICand insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per account, giving you peace of mind that your savings are protected no matter what. Note:APYs in our list below are updated daily but are subject to change. The Federal Reserve meets regularly to decide whether to raise or lower thefederal funds rate, which was just lowered from 5.25%â5.5% down to 4.75%â5.25% at the September 18 meeting. When the Fed rate is higher, borrowing money costs more, meaning taking out a loan and carrying credit card debt will be more expensive. However, high interest rates mean that banks offer better rates on savings products, including high-yield savings accounts and CDs. Now is a good time to put money into high-yield accounts, especially if they have fixed rates, as rates are likely to continue to drop. \"On September 18, 2024, the Fed dropped its interest rate by 0.50 basis points, and further drops are expected as inflation reaches target numbers. Thatâs likely to bring down savings rates, so you can expect to see a lower return on high-yield savings accounts in the coming months and years.\" -Dana Miranda, CEPFÂ® and personal finance journalist A savings account is a type of deposit account offered by banks, credit unions, and other types of financial institutions. Savings accounts allow you to keep your money on deposit in exchange for earning interest. The exact interest rate will depend on the financial institution and can range from 0.01% to upwards of 5%. Savings accounts are also a fairly liquid type of account, which means you can access your money just about as often as you want. Some banks may limit the number of withdrawals you can make in a month (typically, itâs six transactions per month), but youâre still able to exceed any withdrawal cap in placeâyouâll just need to pay a fee on each additional transaction. Finally, savings accounts are considered one of the safest places to keep your money because unlike market investments, there is no risk to your principal deposit. Plus, your money is insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, as long as your bank is backed by the FDIC (or the NCUA for credit unions). Finally, savings accounts are considered one of the safest places to keep your money because, unlike market investments, there is no risk to your principal deposit. Plus, your money is insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution as long as your bank is backed by the FDIC or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) for credit unions.  Before you open a savings account, itâs important to consider the pros and cons of putting your money in one. Of course, one of the biggest benefits of a savings account is that you can earn interest on your balance. The exact interest rate you receive may be higher or lower than the national average of 0.47% APY, but many of the high-yield accounts on our list have rates above 5.00%. You can also rest assured that your money is safe in a savings account. Unlike some types of investments, a savings account will never allow you to lose money. Plus, most high-yield accounts are insured by the FDIC orNCUAup to $250,000 per depositor, per institution in the event of abank failure. That said, there are some downsides to keeping your money in a savings account. For one, even high-yield savings accounts donât offer the same level of earnings asÂ investing your money in the market. However, all savings accounts are sensitive to market fluctuations, and the APY can go up or down at the discretion of your bank. You may also be limited in how many monthly withdrawals you can make. Your financial institution might charge a fee for each additional transaction over the limit. If you plan to open a new savings account, itâs important to review the fees associated with the account and any requirements that need to be met to avoid fees. These may include: Financial institutions set their savings account rates loosely based on thefederal funds rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge other banks to lend money overnight. When theFed raises its rates, this can increase the cost of borrowing and push banks to raise their APYs to attract new customers. The interest rate on a savings account is typically variable, meaning it can fluctuate over time. These rate changes are influenced by several factors, including monetary policy set by the Federal Reserve, general economic conditions, and competition among banks. It's a good practice to periodically check the interest rates of your savings accounts and compare them with rates offered by other institutions to ensure youâre maximizing your earnings. The national average savings account rate is 0.47%, so a rate above that benchmark would be considered above average. However, many banks offerhigh-yield savings accountswith as much as 4% to 5% APY. It pays to shop around to find the highest rates available if youâre looking for a new account. The interest rate on a savings account is essentially the base rate. The APY provides a more comprehensive view of your earnings by factoring in the effects of compounding and calculates how much you'll earn over the course of a year. To determine how much $1,000 will make in a savings account, you need to know the APY of the account and the length of time you plan to keep the money deposited. Additionally, the frequency of interest compounding (daily, monthly, or annually) can impact your final amount. For example, if you deposited $1,000 into a high-yield savings account that earns 5% APY and compounds annually,youâd have a total balance of about $1,050 at the end of one year (assuming you donât make any more contributions). If the interest compounds daily, youâd have a bit more. If you deposited $10,000 into a savings account that earns 5% APY and compounds annually,youâd have a total balance of a little over $10,500 at the end of one year (assuming you donât make any more contributions). If the interest compounds daily, youâd have $10,512.67. Choosing the right savings account requires careful consideration of your financial needs, preferences, and goals. Here are a few considerations to keep in mind as you shop around. While the absolute best APYs can generally be found at online banks and other institutions with lower overhead costs, many consumers prefer the ease and comfort of a large bank. Here are the APYs and minimum opening deposit requirements for several popular banks and credit unions: A savings account is an important tool that just about anyone should have as part of their larger financial plan. However, it isn't always the best place to put your money. There are other types of deposit accounts to consider as well: Ahigh-yield savings accountisnât that much different from atraditional savings account. Both are deposit accounts offered by financial institutions that allow you to set aside money and earn interest on the balance. The primary difference is that a high-yield savings account offers a much higher APY on your funds than a typical savings account. Through the power ofcompound interest, youâll earn interest on the principal balance and any interest you earned previously. That means youâll essentially earn interest on your interest, allowing your savings to grow that much faster. A savings account is designed for storing money over a longer period and earning interest, which encourages saving. It may have limitations on the number of withdrawals or transfers per month. A checking account, on the other hand, is intended for managing daily transactions and offers more accessibility. It usually provides a debit card and check-writing capabilities and often has no limits on the number of transactions. However, checking accounts generally offer lower or no interest compared to savings accounts. Savings accounts and CDsare both savings vehicles that offer interest on your deposits. However, while savings accounts provide relatively easy access to funds with a variable interest rate, CDs lock in your money for a specified term (from a few months to several years) at a (usually) higher, fixed interest rate. Withdrawing funds from a CD before its maturity date typically incurs a penalty, which can reduce the earned interest. On the other hand, savings accounts may have limits on the number of monthly withdrawals, but offer more liquidity than CDs. When choosing between the two, itâs crucial to weigh the importance of access to funds against potentially higher fixed returns with CDs. Savings accounts work similarly to Â toMMAsin that youâll earn interest on your balance and can easily access your funds. While savings accounts focus primarily on providing a safe, liquid place to store cash, MMAs often combine the features of both savings and checking accounts, providing higher interest earnings and more flexible access to funds, such as through checks or debit cards. However, MMAs might require higher minimum balances to avoid fees or to earn the advertised rate. Overall, a savings account would be the best choice in situations where you prioritize earning some interest on your money while maintaining relatively easy access to the funds, without exposing the principal to market risk. When youâre ready to open an account, youâll follow these general steps: To narrow down our top picks for the best high-yield savings accounts, the Fortune RecommendsTMteam evaluated more than 60 online savings accounts from a variety of traditional brick-and-mortar banks, online banks, and credit unions. All the accounts on our list are available to customers in the U.S. no matter where youâre located, subject to the terms of each account. The savings accounts on this list offer an APY at least 10 times the national average. We ranked each account in these core categories: The rates and fee structures for the accounts mentioned are available for limited periods, and APYs are subject to fluctuation, which could impact how much interest you earn. All the bank accounts and credit unions on this list are insured by the FDIC and NCUA, respectively. To open an account, financial institutions, including banks and credit unions, require a deposit of new money, so you may not be able to transfer money you already had in an account at that bank. Dig deeper:learn more about ourbanking methodology. In general, saving accounts are highly liquid accounts, meaning it's fast and easy to access your funds when needed. Federal law used to dictate that account holders could transfer funds out of their accounts up to six times per month. However, this rule was paused in 2020 and you can now make an unlimited number of transfers and withdrawals from savings accounts in many cases. However, some financial institutions still limit the number of withdrawals allowed per month and may impose a fee for excessive transactions. Savings accounts are generally safe, especially when they are held at banks that are insured by the FDIC or at credit unions insured by the NCUA. Both entities insure deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, for each account ownership category. The interest you earn in a savings account is usually subject to income tax. If you earn $10 or more in interest from a savings account in a year, the bank or financial institution will send you a Form 1099-INT, which reports the amount of interest you earned. Even if you don't receive a Form 1099-INT (e.g., if you earned less than $10), you're still generally required to report and pay tax on any interest income. If your goal is to keep cash safe for short-term needs or emergencies, a savings account is a good option since it offers easy access and security for your money. However, it may not give you the highest return on investment (ROI). A savings account is a type of bank account that allows you to deposit money, keep it safe, and earn interest on your balance over time. It's designed for short-term savings, offering easy access to your money with lower risk compared to other investment options. Savings accounts are generally considered safe and are usually backed by the government. In the rare event of a bank failure, if the bank is not insured or if your savings exceed the insured amount, there is a risk of losing money. However, this situation can be avoided by keeping your money in an FDIC- or NCUA-insured account up to the federal maximum of $250,000 for insurance. 1:New and existing Checking and Savings members who have not previously enrolled in Direct Deposit with SoFi are eligible to earn a cash bonus when they set up Direct Deposit of at least $1,000 during the Direct Deposit Bonus Period.

It offers a few online banking products, such ascertificates of deposit (CDs), savings accounts, and MMAs. Great for:Savers who already have a nest egg built up When you opt for an MMA with First Foundation, youâll get an APY rate of 4.9%. However, to open an account, youâll need to have a nest egg already built up: the minimum opening deposit is $1000, and the money cannot come from an account youâve already got open with First Foundation Bank. Whenever youâre ready to access the money in your account, you can do so with a debit card, available by request, or checks. Unlike many major banks, First Foundation Bank doesnât run credit checks for you to open an MMA. This means if other banks have declined you, you have a good chance for approval. Once youâve been approved, you can add beneficiaries or a joint signer. You cannot, however, have the name in a trust. As soon as you make a deposit, your money begins to earn interest. This interest compounds daily and will post at the end of the month. Aside from MMAs, First Foundation offers CDs, checking, and savings accounts.

Learn more:Read ourMerchants Bank of Indiana review Redneck Bank is the online banking division of All America Bankâa bank first established in Oklahoma in 1969. Its motto is âwhere bankinâs funner,â and its website features farm animals, complete with a housefly that moves across the page as you navigate the site. Great for:Savers who have at least $500 on hand at Bankrate Thereâs a saying that you shouldnât be all things to all people, and Redneck Bank has certainly found its niche. Its brand is kitschy and more than a little redneck. On its Mega Money Market sales page, you can see an animated squirrel mowing a lawn of dollar bills as it pushes the lawnmower across the page, complete with sound effects. In a field where banking is filled with blue-and-white, early-internet-style websites, Redneck Bankâs vibrant and playful approach brings a refreshing change. Its debit card has a goat, a squirrel holding a fishing pole, and a pig, and you can use these at ATMs worldwide. Although this account requires at least $500 to open, its other features may make it worth the trade-off. The account comes with a high 4.4% APY, which is among the top on our list. In addition, you wonât pay any maintenance fees. Some of the other notable benefits of this account include a Mastercard debit card, checks, and up to six monthly withdrawals. If you need more than six monthly withdrawals, thereâs a $5 fee per withdrawal. Earn 5% APY on balances up to $15,000 and earn 0.50% APY on amounts over that. You must make 10 debit card transactions each month and receive e-statements to qualify for its top APY. Learn more:Read ourreview of Redneck Bank Northern Bank Direct is the online-only branch of Northern Bank, an institution serving the financial needs of New England since 1960. As a member of the SUM network, customers have access to thousands of fee-free ATMs. Great for:Savers who can keep $5000 in the account While the Northern Bank Direct Money Market Account requires a much higher minimum opening deposit of $5000, the 4.85% APY could make that investment worth it for anyone willing to keep at least $5,000 in the account. Thereâs also no limit to the number of withdrawals you can make and access to surcharge-free ATMs through the SUM network. With online and mobile banking, you can manage your money from anywhere. You wonât pay any monthly service charges, so your money can grow without added fees eating away at it. These great interest rates and lack of maintenance fees make up for its high minimum opening deposit requirement. Setting up an account takes a few minutes, and youâll need to provide the standard information asked by all financial institutions, such as your name, citizenship, Social Security number, and ID. Once your account is opened, aside from accessing your account via your web browser, you will also have access to an iOS and Android app for banking on the go. Northern Bank Direct offers its customers CDs, 1035 exchanges, and health savings accounts in addition to its MMAs. Learn more:Read ourNorthern Bank Direct review All America Bank is an Oklahoma-based institution with a robust number of online offerings nationwide, including personal and business banking and loans. Itâs the same bank that offers you Redneck Bank, which is its online division. Great for:Savers looking for mobile banking with the feel of a small, local bank The All America Bank Mega Money Market account offers a generous 4.4% APY with no minimums or monthly fees. The account allows for six fee-free withdrawals or transfers per billing cycle and it comes with a debit card for easy access to your funds. You can also make mobile deposits, set up direct deposit, and make transfers bank-to-bank and person-to-person. Should you overdraft, your account might be eligible for Overdraft Privilege. This will cover overdrafts of up to $500, although it will cost $25 per item, and specific conditions must be met to qualify. You can set up bill pay on your MMA, which allows 10 free online bill pays per month. It will cost you 50 cents for each additional bill pay. E-statements are free; however, if you opt for paper statements, itâs $3 per month. All America Bank offers checking, savings, CDs, IRAs, and credit cards. Learn more:Read ourAll America Bank review UFB Direct is an online bank and division of Axos Bank, offering a limited selection of products that currently include ahigh-yield savings account, MMA, and mortgages. Itâs headquartered in San Diego although customers can reach a personal banker by phone or secure message 24/7. Great for:Savers who can maintain a $5,000 balance UFBâs MMA had one of the highest interest rates, clocking in at a 4.57% APY. This account does charge a monthly maintenance fee of $0, but customers who maintain a balance of $5,000 or greater get the monthly maintenance fee waived. This account also offers a debit card and check writing privileges. With a UFB Direct account, you can enjoy the freedom of unlimited fund transfers, which is a significant advantage over traditional MMAs, which often impose restrictions on the number of transactions you can make. This flexibility makes managing your finances easier and more convenient, allowing you to move your money as needed without worrying about limitations. In addition to moving funds whenever you want, you can set up automatic funds transfers. This way, you can set it and forget it, helping you maintain consistent savings or investment habits without the need for manual intervention. UFB Direct offers few banking options to suit your needs, which only include checking, savings, and MMAs. Learn more:Read ourUFB Direct review âI opened my first MMA a few months ago and, so far, itâs been a good alternative to a traditional savings account. The APY is far higher than any Iâve ever earned, so Iâve moved most of my money into the account to take advantage.â With inflation cooling, theFederal Reservecut the interest rate by 50 basis points at its meeting on September 18th, 2024, and it has hinted at further rate drops in the near future. The Fedâs decision to begin cutting rates can indirectly lower the yields of money market accounts, as these accounts often track short-term interest rates. Monitor how these changes may affect your potential returns for MMAs. While not all financial institutions adjust their rates immediately after a Fed rate cut, itâs worth comparing offers among online and traditional banks to find the best rate available. A money market account is like a combination betweena checking accountand a savings account. These accounts typically offer higher APYs than checking accounts and, in many cases, identical featuresâcheck-writing abilities, debit card access, and the ability to make withdrawals and deposits via ATM. However, unlike checking accounts, there may be a limit on the number of withdrawalsâusually sixâmade from your money market account each month. And not all money market accounts come with all the features mentioned above. Itâs also not unusual for money market accounts to be tiered, offering higher APYs on higher balances. There may also be a minimum opening deposit or a balance you must maintain to avoid paying maintenance fees. Before opening a money market account, itâs essential to shop around and research APYs, fees, and other features to ensure you find the best account fit for your finances. With inflation at 3.3% year-over-year, the Federal Reserveâs June 11-12, 2024, decision to maintain the federal funds rate of 5.25% to 5.5% is a cautious approach. This means your MMA APY rates may remain high for the time being, but once the Fed cuts rates, you can expect these MMA rates to decline as well. Money market accounts are useful financial tools, offering higher APYs than traditional checking or savings accounts. But itâs important to understand some of thepros and consbefore opening one. One of the primary advantages of money market accounts is that they provide higher interest rates than other deposit accounts. While there may be a limit on the number of withdrawals you can make each month, your money is easily accessibleâmany money market accounts offer debit or ATM cards and check-writing access, so you can tap into your money when you need it. MMAs can be pricey, and you may need to have a certain amount of money saved up to open an account. Some financial institutions have minimum opening deposit requirements for MMAs, which can range from just a few dollars to thousands. Plus, after you open an account, there may be a minimum balance requirement you need to maintain as well. Some banks and credit unions charge a monthly maintenance fee just for having an account. However, that fee may be waived for some accounts if the customer meets a minimum balance requirement. Lastly, some money market accounts limit customers to just six withdrawals per month. If you want unlimited access to your cash, a checking account could be a better option. When deciding between money market accounts, youâll want to consider various account features such as: Think of a money market as a hybrid between a savings account and a checking account: You can earn a solid interest rate on your savings and access your cash when needed. When deciding which deposit account is best for youâa savings account, CD, or checking accountâyou should consider your financial goals, how much liquidity you need, and whether you want a fixed or variable interest rate. There are many similarities betweenmoney market accounts and savings accounts: Both offer higher APYs than checking accounts, are covered FDIC or NCUA insurance, and typically have monthly withdrawal limits However, there are some small differences between the two accounts. With a money market account, customers typically have easy access to cash via ATM, debit card, or checks. Yet with a savings account, customers are typically limited to accessing their cash via electronic transfer. While money market accounts offer variable APYs,CDsprovide a fixed interest rate when you lock up your money for a set amount of time, usually a few months or years. CDs, unlike money market accounts, offer no liquidityâif you need to access your cash before the CDâs term is up, youâll have to pay anearly withdrawal penaltywhich is worth a few months of interest. Since CDs require you to tie your money up for a fixed period, these deposit accounts are best for a financial goal in the future such as saving up for a housing down payment. On the other hand, money market accounts can be a good place to store cash you need immediately like for an emergency fund. Checking accounts are typically used for everyday expenses like your credit card bill or rent payments. These accounts offer low variable interest rates as theyâre not meant for long-term saving. You may be able to access your cash with an ATM or debit card, checks, and electronic transfer. If youâre seeking a higher APY, a money market account offers higher interest rates than checking accounts. Customers, however, may be limited in the number of withdrawals they can make from their money market account. MMAs and MMMFs both have the goal of earning you interest, but theyâre two different vehicles to do so. The former is a savings account offered by a credit union or bank while the other is an investment account offered by a financial institution. For this reason, an MMA is FDIC-insured up to $250,000, while the MMMF isnât FDIC-insured and could lose money. MMAs typically have restrictions on the number of transactions you can conduct per month, although they usually come with check writing and debit card capabilities. Meanwhile, MMMFs donât allow check writing or debit card transactions, although you can often redeem your shares at any time. Your money is safe in a money market account if your bank or credit union is insured by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation(FDIC) orNational Credit Union Administration(NCUA), respectively. These organizations insure your deposits of up to $250,000 per depositor, per account, per ownership category in the unlikely event ofbank failure. You can check if your bank or credit union is covered byFDICorNCUAinsurance through their websites.

Money market accounts offer variable interest rates tied to the federal funds rate, or the interest rate set by the Federal Reserve. This means that the APY you receive on your account varies based on Fed policy. Money market accounts are considered deposit accounts, so theyâre riskless as long as your bank or credit union has FDIC or NCUA insurance, which provides up to $250,000 of coverage. Many money market accounts offer check-writing privileges, although some financial institutions may charge an additional fee for ordering checks. Many money market accounts offer debit cards, but not all do. Check with your financial institution to confirm that your MMA has a debit card. No. Money market accounts are deposit accounts offered by your bank or credit union that are liquid and federally insured. Money market funds are a type of mutual fund that invests in debt securities and may pay a small amount of interest on a monthly basis. These funds are not federally insured. Any interest earned on your money market account balance is considered taxable income and is reported to the IRS on Form 1099-INT. Your individual bank or credit union determines money market account APYs and may fluctuate in response to macroeconomic changes, changes to the federal funds rate, and more.

Putting your money in ahigh-yield savings accountis a great way to maximize your earnings and grow your money over time. But just how much can you earn based on todayâs interest rates? Our savings calculator makes it easy to find out. Using the three sliders at the bottom of the calculator, select your initial deposit, how much you plan to contribute each month going forward, and the number of years you plan to save at this pace. As you make your selections, the calculator will automatically update to display your total estimated interest earnings based on a rate of 4.50% annual percentage yield (APY) compared to what you would earn if you stuck with the national average savings account rate (just 0.46%). A rate of 5% APY might seem highâand it is when compared to the typical savings account rate. The good news is that many banks offer competitivesavings accountrates in this rangeâyou just need to know where to find them. Here are a few banks that regularly offer rates above 4.50% APY: When you put money into a savings account, this balance earns money called interest. Your interest is usually calculated daily, but only deposited monthly, although this varies by banking institution. Your interest rate, expressed as the APY, is what determines how much youâre earning on the money in your account. Almost all savings accounts usecompound interest, which means that the interest you earn is added to your balance, and then future interest is calculated on this larger amount. Over time, this money can add up, especially with high interest rates and large deposits being added regularly. The frequency at which your account compounds can also impact how much the account grows. For example, say you deposited $10,000 in a high-yield savings account with a 3% APY that compounds annually. At the end of a year, youâd have $10,300.00 in your account. But if the interest compounded daily, youâd have $10,304.53. The amount you should save every month depends on your financial goals, income, and expenses. Most people start bybuilding an emergency fundof at least three to six monthsâ worth of living expenses, although if youâre outspending what you make, you should consider saving more. And if you have dependents or other larger financial responsibilities, consider saving six to 12 monthsâ worth of expenses. After youâve got your emergency fund, save a portion of each paycheck in a high-yield savings account so you maximize the interest you earn on your money. While it might not seem like much each paycheck, it will add up over time. Some people set up automatic transfers from their checking to savings account. This hands-off approach can set your savings on autopilot. As your earnings increase over time, you can also increase your savings rate. Check out our detailed guide onhow much money should be in your checking and savings accounts. To make the most of your high-yield savings account, itâs important to understand how they compare to regular savings accounts. Differences in interest rates and where to find the best rates are two of the key differences. A high-yield savings account is a type of savings account that typically offers a higher interest rate compared to a traditional savings account. Youâll often find the best rates at online banks, which have lower overhead costs than traditional brick-and-mortar banks and pass those savings on to customers through higher yields and lower fees. Today, the nationalaverage savings account interest rateis 0.46%, according to theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp.(FDIC). However, some of the best high-yield savings accounts offer 5% annual interest rates or higher. Before opening a high-yield savings account, shopping around and comparing accounts from several financial institutions is essential. Some of the major features you might evaluate include: FDIC or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insurance:Make sure any bank or credit union you choose is insured by the FDIC or the NCUA. If the bank or credit union fails, this insurance means your deposits are protected up to $250,000 per depositor, ownership category, and institution. Getting a great rate is just the first step. If you want to pump up your savings even more, consider these tips: One of the most common reasons someone will switch banks is if their interest rates arenât competitive and they can find better rates elsewhere. While it may be tempting to switch banks if your current bank doesnât offer competitive interest rates, there are other considerations to keep in mind. Does the other bank offer extra benefits, such as lower fees, more accessibility, better hours, or enhanced online and mobile banking features? For example, if you regularly stop into a branch to handle transactions, it might not make sense to switch to a high-yield savings account offered by an online-only bank. Weigh all factorsânot just your interest rateâbefore making a switch. While the compounding frequency will vary by bank, savings account interest is often compounded daily and credited to your account monthly. Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount that you deposited. Compound interest, on the other hand, is calculated on the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Banks use either the simple interest or compound interest formula to calculate interest on a savings account. Simple interest formula:Principal x interest rate x time period Compound interest formula:A = P(1 + r/n)nt The interest that $10,000 would earn over a year depends on the annual percentage yield and frequency of compounding. For example, a 4% APY thatâs compounded daily would result in $408.08 in annual interest earnings. You can browse thebest high-yield savings account ratesto explore your earning potential. Even though the compounding rate varies by bank and account, interest earned in a savings account is typically credited to your account monthly.

    "news_content": "Abigail Rueger is a deputy editor on the banking team at Fortune Recommends. She is passionate about personal finance and offering consumers actionable steps for making positive life changes. Prior to joining Fortune, Abigail spent four years as an editor for Choosing Therapy, a startup dedicated to providing the best mental health information on the web. Cassie is the business and banking editor at Fortune Recommends. She obtained her degree from Northern Kentucky University and is a certified SCRUM master. Prior to joining the team at Fortune Recommends, Cassie was a deputy editor at Forbes Advisor and a Central Operations Project Manager at Fit Small Business. While interest rates are taking a dip due to recent changes from the Federal Reserve, some of the best CDs still offer rates near 5%. By signing up for a certificate of deposit (CD) or share certificate,Â you can earn extra cash without extra risk. As long as your financial institution is covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insurance, your money is safe up to $250,000 per depositor. With a CD, you tie up your savings for a fixed term and, in exchange, you get a rate that beats what a traditional savings account offers. However, beware of early withdrawal penalties: If you tap your cash before the CD matures, youâll be on the hook for a penalty typically worth a few monthsâ of interest. Our editors are committed to bringing you unbiased ratings and information. Our editorial content is not influenced by advertisers. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and companies, so all are measured equally. Read more about oureditorial guidelinesand thebanking methodologyfor the ratings below. Use the widget below to find the CDs with the best rates in your area. In most cases, financial institutions will vary the APY of a CD depending on the length of time youâre willing to deposit the money. While this doesnât always mean youâll earn a higher rate over a longer term, comparing products by term length is worth it to ensure youâre getting the most bang for your buck. In collaboration with Curinos, we've gathered details on some of the highest CD rates available for common term lengths. Open the drawers below to see examples of top rates by term length. Rates are updated daily, however, you should always refer to the institution itself for the most accurate information. The highest1-month CD ratetoday is 3.67% from Merchants Bank of Indiana.

Over the last two years, CD rates marched higher as theFederal Reserve hiked interest ratesand then kept them elevated to help get inflation under control. But now that inflation has cooled, the Fed has changed its tune. The Fed cut rates in September 2024, and now the bestCD rates are falling. If you are thinking aboutjumping into a CD, you shouldnât wait too much longer. After the Fed rate decrease in September, weâre already seeing rates that were above 5.00% APY a month ago now below that threshold. And be wary of any CDs that are near maturity. If you plan to let it renew, make sure you are still getting a good rate. You may want to shop around instead of letting it automatically renew. \"We believe that the market will undergo some volatility as we get closer to the election, however, lowering interest rates nowâand telegraphing another 50 bps in cuts by the end of this year and a total of 150 bps more by the end of next yearâshould allow the market to hit all-time highs again by the end of this year, and more gains for next year.\"â Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance According to theFDIC, the average 12-month CD rate today is 1.88%. However, many banks currently offer rates of 4%â5%, especially for terms under two years. This allows them to attract new customers with high rates, without allowing them to lock in that rate for an extended period of time. Our reserch shows that CD rates for terms of three years or more have been steadily falling over the past six months, and short-term CDs are now dropping quickly as well. Savvy investors may be able to take advantage of the high rates on short term lengths by building aCD ladderinstead of dumping all their funds into a single long-term CD.

Learn more:Read ourPopular Direct review If you donât recognize many of the names listed above, donât be alarmedâthereâs a simple explanation. CDs are a type of deposit account that, on their own, donât provide a large source of income for major financial institutions. Well-known names, such as Chase, PNC, and US Bank, donât rely on CDs to grow their customer base and, therefore, they donât offer large incentives to sign up for them. In many cases, theyâd rather procure customers who use more profitable products, such as loans and credit cards. Therefore, CD rates at these banks are often far lower than what you can find with a small regional bank or online institution. Take a look at these 12-month CDs: While all banking institutions factorFeddecisions into their rate structures, itâs not the only criterion. Banks also evaluate their target market, consider the economic outlook of that market, and create product offerings accordingly. You certainly can pick up a CD at most major banks in the U.S. but, in many cases, the only reason to do so would be if your priority is keeping all of your banking in one spot. With a bit of research, you can often score higher rates as long as youâre not opposed to holding accounts at multiple institutions. It is currently possible to find a certificate of deposit (CD) rate over 5%. Interest rates generally fluctuate depending on changes in thefederal funds rate. Over the past several months, rates have remained high as the Federal Reserve has kept the interest rate between 5.25%â5.5%. Banks are willing to offer higher CD rates when the federal rate is high because CDs are an ideal deposit product that are not easily the way that checking and savings accounts are. CD rates tend to fall when the Fed lowers its target interest rate, which it has hinted at doing before the end of the year. If you want to lock in a CD rate above 5%, now could be an excellent time to pull the trigger. It's important to note that while there are a few exceptions, most CD rates over 5% are tied to a 12-month, 18-month, or two-year term (and the ones with shorter term lengths require high initial deposits). This means that if you withdraw your funds before the term is up, you may incur early withdrawal penalties that forfeit a large portion of the accrued interest. Before you commit to a CD, make sure you can live without access to those funds for the designated time period. \"Most CDs typically auto-renew at whatever the current rate is, which might be something you don't want. Your bank should send you a reminder but, just in case, I set up alerts on my calendar right before CD maturity to remind myself to close or renew the account.\" âKristy Snyder, personal finance expert and Fortune contributor There are several terms and strategies you should familiarize yourself with in order to develop a CD strategy that works well for you. Here are some of the basics: With CDs, orcertificates of deposit, customers receive a fixed interest rate in exchange for tying up their money for a fixed period. Interest is typically paid on a regular basis, either daily, monthly, or quarterly. After a CD reaches maturityâor the end of its termâyou can withdraw the money you deposited initially, plus any earned interest. If you tap your money before the CDâs term is up, most CDs charge anearly withdrawal penalty, which is usually worth a few days or months of interest. Typically, upon maturity, your CD is automatically renewed automatically. If you donât want to roll over your money into a new CD, youâll usually be given a grace period during which you can choose to withdraw your funds. A \"good\" CD rate can be somewhat subjective. That's because you need to strike a balance between the best rate available and the longest amount of time you can afford to keep your money tied up. For example, if you find a CD offering 5% APY, but it requires you to keep your money on deposit for five years, the interest rate may not be worth it. You might need your money sooner or rates could go higher while you're stuck earning a lower return. Generally, a CD rate that's above the national average is a solid choice. Beforedeciding if a CD is worth it, compare accounts from multiple banks and see which one offers the highest rate for the term length you want. CD rates are set by your individual bank or financial institution. Although, there are several factors that can influence these rates. This includes the length of your CD term (longer-term CDs usually offer higher rates than shorter-term ones) and type of CD, the amount of your initial deposit (some CDs offer tiered interest rates), benchmark interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, and temporary promotional offers offered by your financial institution. APY stands for \"annual percentage yield.\" It's a way to calculate the total amount of interest that you can earn on an investment such as a CD in one year, taking into account the effect of compounding interest. The APY of a CD will depend on the interest rate offered by the bank or financial institution, the frequency of compounding (daily, monthly, annually, and so on), and the length of the term of the CD. For savers who are on the fence about locking away their funds in a CD for an extended amount of time, youâre not alone. While some CDs offer terms that are just a few months long, other CDs take years to matureâusually, you earn a higher rate with these CDs, but youâll have to part with your money for longer. One way to score the benefits of both short and long-term CDs is to set up aCD ladder. This is asavings strategywhere you split your savings between several CDs of varying maturities. Hereâs how a CD ladder works: If you want to invest $3,000, you would invest $1,000 each in three CDs of staggering maturitiesâletâs sayone-year, two-year, and three-year. When each CD matures, you reinvest that money in a 3-year CD. That way you have access to cash every year. \"If you want to earn interest on your cash but also need to maintain liquidity for emergencies or opportunities, consider creating a CD ladder. Once established, this rolling savings vehicle allows you to earn competitive interest on your cash while also keeping a portion of your savings accessible at regular intervals.\" âStephanie Colestock, Fortune contributor If you opt for a CD as your primary savings vehicle, you should be aware that interest earned on the funds you deposit is consideredtaxable interestby the IRS. The interest you earn is subject to federal and state income tax. Your financial institution will typically send you a 1099-INT statement for any interest earned over $10, and the amount you owe will depend on how much interest youâve earned and your tax bracket. If you withdraw funds from your CD early, you can also expect to see those penalties on your 1099-INT form. Certificates of deposit are considered safeinvestments so long as they are helped by FDIC- or NCUA-insured financial institutions which insure your deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank, for each account ownership category or up to $250,000 per share owner, per insured credit union, for each account ownership category. There are varioustypes of CDsyou can choose from depending on how much money youâd like to deposit into your CD, whether youâd prefer to have access to your money before maturity, and more. A few of the most common types of CDs include: Brokered CDs are purchased and sold through a brokerage account rather than through a bank or credit union. These CDs are usually issued by banks and then sold to brokerages, which then offer them to customers at higher APYs than traditional CDs. Youâll also get greater flexibility with a brokered CD: Rather than pay an early withdrawal penalty, you can access your cash early by selling your brokered CD on a secondary market. However, in doing so you open yourself to interest rate risk. If you sell your brokered CD after interest rates have risen, your CD, with a lower rate, will be less valuable to investors, and you may lose money when you sell it. Some brokered CDs may have a call feature too. Callable CDshave a call feature that allows the financial institution that issued them to terminate the CD before it reaches maturity. When this happens, the investor keeps the principal and any interest they accrued up to that point. Typically, a financial institution calls a CD when interest rates drop because it can offer lower interest rates on newly issued CDs. After your CD is called, youâll have to reinvest your funds at a lower rateâthis is known as reinvestment risk. Due to this risk, callable CDs usually offer higher APYs than CDs without a call feature. With a bump-up CD, you can request an APY on your CD if interest rates rise after you've opened your account. Typically, youâll be eligible to increase the rate on your CD once or twice during the term. This type of CD does not charge a penalty for withdrawing funds before your CD reaches maturity. This type of CD is less common than other CD types and may also offer lower APYs than traditional CDs. Compare:No-penalty CDs vs. savings accounts Jumbo CDs typically require a minimum opening deposit of at least $100,000 but usually offer higher APYs than traditional CDs. With a variable-rate CD, the APY fluctuates based on the interest rate. These CDs are riskier than traditional CDs because if interest rates drop before the CD reaches maturity, you can receive a lower interest rate. Every CD is a little different, so youâll want to pay close attention to the account features and fine print before decidingwhere to put your savings. Youâll want to consider a few factors whenchoosing a CD: Tocalculate your earnings from a CD, youâll need to use the following formula: P(1+R/N)(NT) = A. Where âAâ represents the value of your CD, including interest. \"P\" is equal to your principal balance or initial deposit. \"R\" represents your yearly interest rateâin this case, it would be your APY. \"N\" represents the compound frequency of your CD in a given year, and \"T\" represents the number of years until your CDâs maturity date. Letâs illustrate this with an example: Our equation would turn out like this: 500 x ((1+(5.15/12)) x (12 x 1)) =$526.37 So, if you deposit $500 into a 12-month CD with an interest rate of 5.15% that compounds monthly, you could expect to withdraw about $526 at the end of the term. To calculate rates accurately, you may need to do a bit of extra math to determine your variables. For example, if the term length is under a year, youâll need to determine what percentage of â1â to use for the variable âT.â A three-month term would be 0.25, a six-month term would be 0.5, and so forth. Here are more examples that calculate the end value of a CD with a $500 opening deposit and 5% APY: While CDs can be attractive for their high interest rates, they arenât a perfect fit for everyone. Letâs review some of thepros and cons.  CDs differ from othersavings accountsin a few key ways. This type of account not only functions differently, but it may be better suited for a certain type of consumer who is saving for a goal with a specific timeline. High-yield savings accountswork in the same way as traditional savings accounts. Itâs a deposit account at a credit union or bank that you can use for saving and earning interest on your moneyâusually at a higher rate. This type of savings account differs from CDs in that they offer greater access to your funds, rather than requiring you to lock away your funds for a set amount of time. As such, there's no penalty for making withdrawals. Learn more:CompareCDs vs. savings accounts \"CDs are some of my favorite savings tools, especially as someone whoâs easily tempted to overspend. Being able to 'hide' my savings somewhere that I canât touch allows me to meet my financial goals better and earn interest in the process.\"âStephanie Colestock, Certified Financial Education Instructor (CFEI) Money market accountsfunction as a hybrid between savings accounts and checking accounts. Similar to CDs, these accounts typically offer much higher APYs than checking accounts, but may still offer some of the same features including check writing, debit card access, and the ability to make withdrawals and deposits via ATM. Like a CD, this type of account may also be of interest to savers who have the ability to make a larger opening deposit.

Right now, Quontic, Bask Bank, and Citibank are offering the highest APYs on their 3-month CDs. For savers looking for longer term lengths, Colorado Federal Savings Bank and First National Bank of America are offering high APYs on their 1-year term lengths, at 4.50% and 4.71%, respectively. A CD may be the best banking choice for you if you are saving for a long-term goal with a specific timeline in mind. To avoid early withdrawal penalties or potentially forfeiting any interest earned on the funds in your CD, you want to be sure that you won't need access to your money before your CD's maturity date. The minimum balance for a CD depends on your financial institution. The minimum may range from zero to thousands of dollars. As long as you meet the membership requirements needed to join a credit union and verify that the financial institutions you're considering are FDIC or NCUA members, bothbanks and credit unionsoffer similar products, including CDs. Rates will vary across the board. When you invest in a CD, you typically deposit one lump sum and then leave it alone until the account reaches maturity. However, some financial institutions offer special types of \"add-on\" CDs that allow you to deposit additional funds after the initial deposit. The amount and frequency of deposits you're allowed to make depend on the particular account. Banks and credit unions update current CD rates based on market conditions. These rates typically receive an update no more frequently than weekly, although some don't do so for months. While multi-year term lengths mean your money has more time to incubate, leading to more interest earned, a six-month CD lets you make gains on your principal without locking up your funds long-term. CD rates are the highest they've been in years, but they're starting to fall with the Fed's rate change. So, yes, it's a good time to put your money in a CD, but hurry if you want to lock in your money at a top rate. Yes, certificates of deposit are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). The FDIC insures all its membersâ bank accounts, including savings, money market accounts, and CDs, up to $250,000 per customer per bank. Therefore, in the rare case of a bank failure, your money stays safe. If you take out a CD with a credit union, make sure itâs insured through the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)âa similar institution to the FDIC that insures credit unions.

    "news_title": "The 100 Most Powerful Women in Business of 2024 | Fortune",
    "news_content": "The Fortune Most Powerful Women (MPW) list is the definitive ranking of female business leadersâand in its 27th year, itâs more competitive than ever. The 2024 MPW list ranks the 100 Most Powerful Women globally, reflecting corporationsâ global scope and the nature of executivesâ work, which spans the planet. The list features women from six continents, 19 countries and territories, and 14 different industries, proving there is no one-size-fits-all approach to reaching the pinnacle of business. These 100 executives are leading todayâs companiesâwell over half are CEOs, largely across the Fortune 500 and Global 500âand the businesses of tomorrow. Of 26 newcomers, several amassed power amid the generative AI frenzy, from unicorn founders to CFOs steering the financial health of major AI players like Nvidia and Microsoft. Twenty leaders are also included on Fortuneâs new MPW Asia listâa first-time ranking that highlights more leaders to know in the Asia-Pacific region. With a new No. 1, the 2024 MPW list shows the dynamic nature of the climate in which todayâs most influential businesses operate and the skill required of the executives leading companies through it.

    "news_title": "Exclusive: Election betting site Polymarket gives Trump a 67% chance of winning but is rife with fake âwashâ trading, researchers say | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "The prediction market Polymarket has skyrocketed into mainstream consciousness during the 2024 U.S. elections, with the platform reporting that users have placed $2.7 billion in bets over whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will be elected president in early November. But analysts at two crypto research firms have found evidence of rampant wash trading on Polymarket, even as its odds have been shared widely across social media and mainstream media outlets. Donald Trump currently has a 67% chance of winning, according to the platform. In separate investigations completed by the blockchain firmsChaos LabsandInca Digitaland shared exclusively withFortune,analysts found that Polymarket activity exhibited signs of wash trading, a form of market manipulation where shares are bought and sold, often simultaneously and repeatedly, to create a false impression of volume and activity. Chaos Labs found that wash trading constituted around one-third of trading volume on Polymarketâs presidential market, while Inca Digital found that a âsignificant portion of the volumeâ on the market could be attributed to potential wash trading, according to its report. While other prediction markets, includingKalshiandRobinhood, have launched in the U.S. since a pivotal court decision in September legalized electoral betting, Polymarket remains the largest platform by far, thanks in part to its crypto-native design and offshore operations. Polymarket remains inaccessible to U.S. investors. Still, with less than a week until Election Day, the suspicious activity on Polymarket raises questions about the accuracy of the site, which, its 26-year-old founderShayne Coplanhastouted, can âdemystify the real-world events that matter most to you.â âPolymarketâs Terms of Use expressly prohibit market manipulation,â a Polymarket spokesperson said in a statement shared withFortuneafter publication. âWe strive to provide users with the fairest analysis possible and our transparency allows the market to decide.â Founded in 2020 and backed by VCs including Peter Thielâs Founders Fund, Polymarket tried to launch electoral betting in the U.S. before beingforced offshoreby the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in early 2022. Unlike competitors such as PredictIt and Kalshi, which recently prevailed in a lawsuit against the CFTC to operate in the U.S., Polymarket runs its platform on the blockchain Ethereum. Coplan says the crypto element offers greater visibility into its trading activity. âThe beauty of Polymarket is itâs all peer-to-peer and transparent,â he recentlypostedonX. Polymarket volume exploded during the recent presidential election, with outlets from theWall Street JournaltoFortunereporting the betting odds on its platform alongside more traditional metrics such as polling data. As a sign of increased credibility around prediction markets, polling star Nate Silver joined Polymarket as an advisor in July. Polymarketâs crypto design and offshore operations have drawn scrutiny from other quarters. This includes recent reports claiming there ismanipulativetrading on the siteâmost notably by a single French trader who allegedly caused Trumpâs odds to soar. Polymarket hasinsistedthat the user has âextensive trading experienceâ and was not acting nefariously. The evidence of wash trading appears to be a serious sign of misbehavior on the platform. To conduct its analysis, Chaos Labs looked at on-chain data to isolate high-volume traders, filtering out users who were likely engaged in normal activities like market making. It then separated users who exhibited signs of wash trading, examining their ratio of buy and sell orders and taking account of their share holdings compared with their trading volume. Chaos Labs concluded that around one-third of trading volumeâand overall usersâon the presidential market alone was likely wash trading, along with across all markets. The practice is common across crypto applications, and especially ones with the potential for future token launches and airdrops, with users often earning tokens based on activity. The Informationreportedin September that Polymarket has explored launching its own proprietary token. âThe challenges of prediction markets are not unlike those of any other application with a market,â said Omer Goldberg, the founder of Chaos Labs, which is backed by Haun Ventures and develops data integrity software. âWash trading is not specific to Polymarket.â Both Chaos Labs and Inca Digital found another anomaly on Polymarket: The purported trading volume on its presidential market, reported in U.S. dollars on Polymarketâs website, does not match the on-chain data. Inca found the actual transaction volume on the presidential betting market to be around $1.75 billion, compared with Polymarketâs reported figure of $2.7 billion. Chaos Labs attributed this to Polymarket conflating traded shares with U.S. dollars. To put it more clearly, users can buy shares of candidates at different odds. A âyesâ share of Hillary Clinton for president costs just $0.01, given the vast unlikelihood that she will be elected, but Chaos Labs found that Polymarket is reporting that share as $1 of volume. This discrepancy, along with the wash trading, underscores the untested nature of a platform on which many rely for signals about the presidential election. Polymarketâs decision to operate on blockchain rails, however, also means that researchers such as Chaos Labs and Inca Digital can analyze activity. Coplan has described usersâ ability to audit Polymarket as a âfeature, not a bug.â âThese companies want to attract real users and build trust in their markets,â Goldberg said. âIdentifying and reducing wash trading is critical to ensure that prediction markets are representative of everybody, with market prices and volumes determined by an authentic, enduring user base rather than being muddled by inorganic flow.â Â© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "news_title": "Inside Dubaiâs risky bid to become the worldâs crypto hub | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "In April, the leading crypto exchange Binanceannouncedthat it had received approval to operate in Dubai, the biggest and wealthiest city in the United Arab Emirates. The license was one of the first granted by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, a regulator created in 2022 by the Dubai government to supervise the growing crypto industry. The green light was a major win for Binance, which was stillrebuildingafter the criminal conviction and imprisonment of its founder and former CEO, Changpeng âCZâ Zhao, by the U.S. government in late 2023. It also reflected a developing strategy for the nascent regulator: attracting the worldâs leading crypto companies to the Gulf emirate, even as other jurisdictions turn them away. Interviews with Dubaiâs regulators, venture investors, and entrepreneurs reveal a city that is establishing itself as a global crypto hub as the industry finds itself at a crossroads, with Dubai boasting a higher risk tolerance than its counterparts in the U.S. and Europe. As other non-Western cities, from Singapore to Hong Kong, compete to attract blockchain businesses, Dubai hopes that its combination of clear regulations, ample capital, and unique âfree zoneâ structure will set it apart from other competitors. As other governments like the Bahamasdiscovered with FTX, however, the downsides of inviting the often unruly crypto sector to set up shop can often outweigh the benefits. âSmaller companies, smaller countries, and smaller organizations are the risk takers,â said Ralf Glabischnig, the founder of Crypto Oasis, a Dubai-based blockchain ecosystem. âIâm very happy that the UAE is taking that risk, and I assume we will have a few more crashes.â The emirate has taken a novel approach to overseeing crypto by carving out a space for it within a special economic zone called the Dubai International Financial Centre, established in 2004 to attract foreign companies from banks to tech giants to set up operations in the budding economy. DIFC has its own court system and financial regulator, the Dubai Financial Services Authority, which began laying out plans to oversee crypto businesses in 2021. To date, DFSA has granted licenses to around 10 crypto firms, including Ripple. While the setup and separation of DIFC from the rest of Dubai can seem confusing from the outside, the DFSA chief executive Ian Johnston toldFortunethat the free zone can be thought of as a âfinancial Vatican City.â DIFC operates under a common law legal regimeâoverseen by judges drawn from countries like England and Australiaâthat has made it a magnet for more traditional firms like hedge funds and law firms used to operating in Western jurisdictions. Johnston says DFSA has loosened its regulatory strategy as it becomes more familiar with the sector, including creating a white list of approved tokens and welcoming in companies that do not have licenses in other jurisdictions. âAs we become more comfortable that weâre getting the right sort of applicant, then we are relaxing our conditions a bit,â Johnston toldFortune. He insisted that, where U.S. regulators often have a contentious relationship with each other, DFSA does not view itself as competing with the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which is charged with issuing licenses in the rest of Dubai. As he put it, âItâs all business thatâs going to be in Dubai anyway.â In an interview withFortune,VARA CEO Matthew White said that the agencyâs goal is to balance regulation with innovation. On occasion, it has stepped in to rein in rogue crypto actors, as it did in October when itissuedcease and desist orders and fines to seven âentitiesâ for operating without the required licenses. White declined to comment on the decision, though he noted that VARA has around 50 employees, which makes itcomparable in sizeto the New York State Department of Financial Services. âThe challenge that youâve got is youâre marrying up this industry that moves at a blistering pace with what is largely a traditional kind of regulatory system,â he said. Despite its crypto-native approach, VARA has faced criticism that it is moving too slowly to grant licenses. According to White, the regulator has already received hundreds of applications and is working to increase its staff in order to handle the influx. White pushed back at the idea that Dubai has a broader risk tolerance than other governments. âItâs not really about whether weâve got a higher or lower risk appetite,â he said. âThe mechanism by which we go through our diligence is different, and that enables us to make those decisions.â Still, the contrast of VARA granting a company like Binance a license, after it was charged orpushed outof the U.S. and European countries, is striking. Tammer Qaddumi, the cofounder and general partner of the UAE-based VC firm VentureSouq, toldFortunethat Dubaiâs goal is to expand its economic footprint, with even different emirates within the UAE jockeying for firms. âThe truth is, they are competitive and want people to come and set up, and they will use different tools,â he said. âSome are incentives like cash rebates, some are attractiveness of office locations, and some are licensing and permission.â As lawmakers in the U.S. continue to squabble over legislation, Dubai has signaled to the crypto industry that it is open for business, even if the embrace comes with growing pains.

    "news_title": "Consensys layoffs: Ethereum giant cuts 20% of workforce | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "Consensys, the maker of the popular MetaMask crypto wallet, is cutting over 160 employees across all divisions of the company. Founder and CEO Joe Lubin announced the news in a blog post that attributed the layoffs to headwinds from the macroeconomy as well as legal expenditures from the companyâs protracted battles with regulators. âMultiple cases with the SEC, including ours, represent meaningful jobs and productive investment lost due to the SECâs abuse of power and Congressâs inability to rectify the problem,â wrote Lubin. âSuch attacks from the U.S. government will end up costing many companiesâ¦many millions of dollars.â Lubinâs comments echo a widely held sentiment in the crypto industry that the Securities and Exchange Commission has operated in bad faith when it comes to setting out a clear regulatory pathway for digital asset companies. The agencyâs head, Gary Gensler, says the SECâs existing laws are clear and has filed lawsuits alleging securities laws violations against the crypto industryâs leading companiesâincluding Consensys. Lubin launched Consensys in Brooklyn in 2014 as an incubator of sorts for projects building on the then-nascent blockchain, which today is the second-biggest blockchain and a backbone of the crypto industry. Its flagship product is MetaMask, which offers a decentralized way to hold tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem and access a variety of related services. Consensys has since relocated its headquarters to Texas, where it has worked on developing various infrastructure tools to support Ethereum. In recent years, this work has been hampered by ongoing regulatory uncertainty, which led Lubin to take the bold step ofsuing the SECin April as part of a bid to confirm that Ethereum is not a securityâa view widely held by many crypto lawyers. A federal court dismissed the preemptive this summer but a related case, brought by the SEC, is ongoing. Consensys has appeared towin at least onelegal battle, though, forcing the agency to step back from an investigation into many firms and developers who rely on Ethereum in their operations. Lubin toldFortunethat the layoffs, which he describes as a âtough but prudent decision to streamline our operations,â would affect around 162 of the 828 employees who work at Consensys. He added that layoffs would extend to every unit, including business development and product. The company says it is supplying generous severance, including career support and extended health care benefits. Going forward, Lubin wrote that Consensys will seek to its accelerate its transition from a conventional company into a decentralized ânetwork stateâ in accordance with the ideals of blockchain.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin teases all-time high days from presidential election | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "Bitcoin has surged over 8% this week, coming within a few dollars of its record high on Tuesday. The original cryptocurrency pushed past $73,000 before paring gains on Wednesday as the crypto industry prices in a win for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Crypto bulls predict Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high, previously set in March, within the days leading up the election. After rising over $2,000 within a few hours, the price of Bitcoin fell slightly and continues to oscillate between $71,000 and $73,000. The currency has grown 12% throughout âUptoberââa nickname coined for Bitcoinâs historically lucrative month. The broader crypto market is following a similar trend this week with Ethereum and Solana growing 4% and 5%, respectively. Dogecoinâthe memecoin typically associated with Elon Muskâhas advanced 23%, lifted by the billionaireâsmentionof the coin at multiple Trump rallies. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw strong inflows coinciding with Bitcoinâs bump on Tuesday. The ETFs pulled in $870 million amid pre-election market volatility, the third-largest inflows since their approval in January. Bitcoin reached its all-time high of over $73,000 in March following the introduction of these Bitcoin ETFs to the market. The run comes as Trump widens his lead against Vice President Harris on Polymarket, a crypto prediction market. With the election less than a week away, Polymarket bettors give Trump a 67% chance of winning the election, while traditional polls have the two in a dead heatâthough new evidence shows a good portion of the trading on the siteis fake. Both candidates are in the final stretch of their campaigns, making a final push to court undecided voters and encourage supporters to head to the polls. On Sunday, Trump held a rally at Madison Square Garden at which Elon Musk talked about his involvement in Trumpâs proposed Department of Government Efficiency, or D.O.G.E.âa nod to to Dogecoin. Trump has made a substantial effort to appeal to the crypto industry this election cycle, promising to make America âthe crypto capital of the planet.â He has launched his own crypto venture, spoke at this yearâs Bitcoin conference in Nashville, and vowed tofire SEC chairGary Gensler on day one, among other things. While Harris has taken a more tempered pro-crypto stance than President Biden, some analysts predict that the price of Bitcoin could crash with a Harris victory. CEO of Transform Ventures and crypto millionaire Michael Terpin, says the currency will continue to grow either way. âThereâs just too much momentum right now,â Terpin toldFortune.âWeâre at the point of the cycle where it usually does go up quite a bit. I just think that Trump winning would make it quicker and faster and higher.â Â© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

    "news_title": "Solana soars 19% thanks to an AI memecoin frenzy | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "Solana, the third most popular blockchain, has been on a tear the past few weeks thanks to AI memecoins, a new niche in crypto that blends artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies derived from internet jokes. The run has sent Sol, the native-token of the Solana blockchain which many memecoins are built on, above $175 for the first time in two months. While the broader crypto market continues to consolidate this week following early October lows, Solanaâs gains have outpaced those of the largest cryptocurrencies. Sol is outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and others included in theCoinDesk 20 Index. Solana is up 19% over the last seven days while, in contrast, Bitcoin is up 0.8%, and Ethereum and XRP are down 3%. This monthâs price action from Solana, which touts itself as an alternative to Ethereumâs high fees and slow transaction rates, has brought SOL to a new all-time high against Ethereum, with 1 Sol equivalent to 0.07 Ethereum, and the highest price against Bitcoin since August. AI memecoins have captivated the crypto community since GoatseusMaximus, a new memecoin, sparked conversation about the intersection of the two technologies. The frenzy has sent daily active users on the Solana blockchain to a record high of almost 9 million and caused transaction fees on Wednesday to reach a high of $4.5 million, according to DeFiLlama data. Goatseus Maximus, or GOAT, was created on October 10 by an anonymous developer known as Pump.fun and gained massive attention when Marc Andreessen-backed AI bot Truth Terminalendorsedit on X. The token, founded on the AI botâs fixation with goat memes, has reached a market cap of $722 million since its creation two weeks ago and triggered a flurry of new AI-created memecoins. The sector has reached a market cap of over $2 billion, up 24% in the last day, according to CoinGecko. Other Solana-based memecoins are up in the frenzy as well. âPopcatâ and âcat in a dogs worldâ are both up over 20% this week. Another factor in Solanaâs recent run may be the ongoing rapidexpansionof decentralized finance, or DeFi. Solana is up more than 450% this year. Since January, the total value locked on Solanaâthe U.S. dollar value of digital assets staked on a blockchain through DeFiâ has almost quadrupled to $6.9 billion.

    "news_title": "Trump's crypto project plans to launch its own U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin â report | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "World Liberty Financial, former president Donald Trumpâs crypto venture,launchedits native token earlier this month, and now is reportedly planning something more ambitious: its own stablecoin, which can serve as a stand-in for the U.S. dollar, according to Decrypt. Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged 1 to 1 to the value of a fiat currency like the dollar or euro, have become wildly popular over the last three years. If thereportabout World Liberty, published on Monday by crypto publication Decrypt, is accurate, the World Liberty team would be joining the likes ofPayPal,Coinbase, and Robinhood, all of which have or are developing their own version of stablecoins. The World Liberty stablecoin is still in development and will take time to launch as the team works to determine âhow to make the financial product safe before bringing it to market,â an anonymous source told Decrypt. Those keeping close tabs on the platform might have seen this development coming. Earlier this month, the World Liberty teamannouncedthat Rich Teo, cofounder of Paxosâa stablecoin issuer that manages the U.S. dollar-backed Paxos Standard Token, or PAXâwould be joining the platform to serve as its stablecoin and payments lead. However, building a stablecoin is not as easy as hiring one person. It requires a large amount of capital and the navigation of ambiguous regulatory and legal boundaries, not to mention the stamina to compete with giants like Tether and USDC. To secure a stablecoinâs value to one steady price, it must be collateralized, or backed by a fiat currency. Some projects have attempted to circumvent this requirement with crypto gimmicks, but these have mostly collapsed spectacularly, as was the case in 2022 when stablecoin issuer Terra failed, wiping out billions. Despite lingering questions about how the World Liberty team plans to develop a reliable stablecoin, the Trump family could make a significant profit if the project does get off the ground. Tether, the worldâs largest stablecoin, reported a record $5.2 billion profit in just the first half of 2024. World Liberty Financial, which was announced in early September, a month and a half prior to the election, has beendescribedas a âdecentralized finance money market.â WLFI is a so-calledgovernance token, a token that allows holders to make decisions, vote on proposals and govern a crypto project on-chain. The token is nontransferable and does not earn yield. Ahead of its launch, the company white-listed over 100,000 accredited investors and hoped to raise $300 million from the initial sale. It has fallen short of that target, with $14 million raised and only 4.7% of tokens offloaded. Â© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

    "news_title": "Exclusive: Prediction market Kalshi launches crypto deposits as Trump maintains big lead on betting sites | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "As traders pour hundreds of millions of dollars into presidential betting markets, the leading U.S. prediction platformKalshiis launching crypto depositsâwhere users can fund their bets in the form of the stablecoin USDC rather than cashâin a bid to compete with its top rival, the offshore companyPolymarket. Starting today, Kalshi users will be able to load their accounts with USDC, a popular cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar. This move will allow Kalshi customers to move money faster and cheaper and help Kalshi challenge Polymarketâs crypto-powered platform, which has exploded in popularity during the 2024 election cycle. Political prediction platforms, which allow users to gamble on the outcomes of electoral contests, have existed for decades, but have come into the spotlight in the 2024 election, largely owing to Polymarket. The site, which recently hired polling guru Nate Silver as an advisor, has attracted heavy tradingâand media coverageârelated to its presidential betting market. According to Polymarketâs website, users have traded $2.6 billion worth of volume on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will be elected, while Kalshi says it has brought in just under $85 million in bets on the presidential race. Part of the trading discrepancy is the result of Kalshiâs market being much newer. Founded in 2018 by Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara, Kalshi first won approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to launch nonpolitical betting markets in 2020 on contracts like the weather before suing the agency last year to launch political contracts as well. After winning its lawsuit at the district court level in early September, Kalshilaunchedpolitics-related bets in early October, including for the presidential race. In contrast, Polymarket ran afoul of the CFTC by launching political prediction markets without the agencyâs permission, earning a $1.4 million penalty in early 2022 and forcing the platform to move outside the U.S. Its lack of regulation has proved popular with users, who have also flocked to the platform because of its crypto-native designâPolymarket connects with customersâ crypto wallets and settles bets with USDC. Its blockchain design has also opened the platform up to scrutiny, including accusations of manipulation after Polymarketconfirmedthat four of the leading accounts betting on Trump are controlled by a single French trader. In an interview withFortuneearlier in October, Mansour said that he originally explored building Kalshi on top of blockchain technology, but ultimately decided against it for regulatory reasons. âWe didnât really see a viable business that way for us if you want to attract institutional participation,â he said. He argued that USDC deposits, however, would be faster for users than relying on ACH (Automated Clearing House) and bank transfers, and would also mean lower fees. Kalshi is working with the crypto firm Zero Hash to enable USDC deposits, which the company says will enable near-instant 24/7/365 funding, as opposed to bank transfers, which can take three to four days. Zero Hash is managing the conversion and compliance aspects of the new feature. While Kalshi still lags behind Polymarket in trading volume, Mansour said that its regulated approach will prove more popular among users, especially with Polymarket cut off to U.S. traders. Kalshi is backed by investors including the VC giant Sequoia, while Polymarket is backed by Founders Fund, which counts Peter Thiel as a partner. Robinhood alsolaunchedpolitical gambling markets to select U.S. customers on Monday. With Election Day fast approaching, Trump has separated from Harris to a commanding lead among Kalshi customers, rising from a near deadlock on Oct. 10 to a 62% chance of winning as of publication. Traditional pollsters are still forecasting the election as a coin flip. Â© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

    "news_title": "Lightspark founder David Marcus unveils details of his crypto-powered payments startup | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "David Marcus is used to building great things. In 1996, at age 23, he founded a successful company and went on to sell another one for $240 million toeBayin 2011. Soon after, he became president ofPayPal, helping to turn the firm into a payment giant before taking a senior role atFacebookwhere he oversaw the growth of the wildly-successful Messenger app. Marcus is not the sort of man who accepts failure. Yet, in recent years, this is what he has had to confront. In his final role at Facebook, Marcus led the ill-starred Libra projectâa wildly ambitious attempt to create a global cryptocurrency, pegged to real-world currencies, within WhatsApp and the companyâs other apps. The project triggered a ferocious blowback from politicians and was ultimately crushed. Undaunted, Marcus went on to launch a company of his own called Lightspark in 2022,raising $175 millionto promote the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. This too has been an uphill struggle. This week, Marcus took the stage in a chic Los Angeles hotel to announce a suite of new Lightspark products he believes will put Bitcoin at the center of global money transfers. Svelte and handsome with grey hair, Marcus charmed the audience with his visionâbut, in a sign of the challenge before him, he declared he will work on it for the rest of his life. Itâs not clear if that will be enough time. As anyone who has used Venmo or Zelle can attest, moving money within the U.S. is free and easy. The same is true within other countries. Itâs a different story sending money across borders, which entails sending wiresâa cumbersome process that takes days, typically costs around $40 and is not available outside banking hours. The reasons for this are partly technological, but mostly due to geopolitics. âAll [financial] networks are run by countries or by companies that are perceived as companies,â Marcus said, referring to government-run payment networks like FedNow or Indiaâs UPI, and to big corporations like MasterCard. Political leaders are wary of relying on another countryâs network for something as critical as payments, meaning there is no equivalent of Venmo across borders. The upshot is that it is expensive or impractical to send even small amounts of money between the U.S. and Mexico, or between Singapore and the Philippinesâas millions of workers abroad can attest. The solution to this, says Marcus, is to turn to a money network that is neutral and decentralized: Bitcoin. His company Lightspark is trying to bring that about, building software that can let anyone use the Bitcoin network without incurring its infamous costs and slow processing times. The task has proved a slog since Lightspark has been relying in part on an existing upgrade for Bitcoin called the Lightning Networkâa service panned even by crypto devotees as buggy and expensive. On Thursday, Lightspark touted a series of upgrades it says will overcome the Lightning Networkâs defects, and accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin in global money transfers. Those upgrades include the ability to connect any wallet to the Lighting Network around the clock and a Layer 2 (a blockchain sits atop a primary blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum) network of its own called Spark. Meanwhile, Marcus said a variety of well-known financial brandsâincludingStripe,Coinbaseand NuBankâare trying out Lightsparkâs tools. For Marcus, all of this is part of a future where people easily send money across borders using a Venmo-style interface. In the background, the transaction will occur by converting one currencyâsay the Brazilian realâinto Bitcoin and then converting it again into the transfer recipientâs local currency such as the U.S. dollar. He also anticipates that stablecoin transactions, which are rapidlygaining traction, will migrate to Bitcoinâs network from blockchains like Ethereum andTron. Lightspark is not the only company trying out cryptocurrency as a solution to cross-border payments. San Francisco-based Ripple has long been touting XRP as a âbridge currencyâ to make these transfers more efficient. Marcus says Bitcoin is the better solution since it is much bigger and more decentralized than XRP, and because banks can trust the Bitcoin network as durable enough to be here 100 years from now. Marcusâs vision of Bitcoin as a large and neutral intermediary at the center of global money transfers is an intriguing one and, in theory, it could work. The question is whether Lightspark can persuade anyone to use it. The plan for Bitcoin-based money transfers relies on users having something called a âUniversalMoney Addressâ or UMA that, in the same way as email, lets anyone send or receive with that address. On Thursday, Lightspark announced a tool that makes it easy for those who have an UMA to grant permission to third party apps to integrate the address. In practice, this means people will be able to tie their UMA addressâa gateway to the Bitcoin networkâto their existing bank and personal finance apps. So far, though, no non-crypto companies in North America appear to have done so, and Lightspark would not provide any details about when they would. The company did, though, say the giant Brazilian neo-bank NuBank is using its services and pointed out that the appetite for payment alternatives in Latin America is thriving. Lightspark declined to share any figures such as active user numbers that would reflect whether the service is getting any traction. It also offered no specifics about how much revenue it is pulling in, though Marcus toldFortunethe company is growing fast and that is charging various companies on a per-transaction basis. Meanwhile, one person familiar with Lightsparkâs ambitions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he believes the company is simply too late to the game. He pointed to the rapid adoption of existing stablecoin networks as a sign that Marcusâs Bitcoin solutionâas elegant as it may beâwill struggle to displace what people are using already. Marcus unfazed by such doubts. He says Lightspark has plenty of moneyâin part thanks to its purchase of a significant amount of Bitcoin two years ago when prices were slumping. He predicts that, now much of the technical infrastructure is in place, the world will soon be ready to make Bitcoin a backbone of global finance. Â© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "news_title": "Resy founder's new dining app uses cryptoâjust donât let its users know that | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "Ben Leventhal would rather tell you where to sit at a restaurant than what to order. âIf you go to Balthazar, sit on table 62,â he says, sipping his tequila. âItâs on the left side of the room and youâll get the best views.â Over the last two decades, the fortysomething New Yorker has been instrumental to the rise offoodie culture. First he told us where to eat, launching news site Eater in 2005âsince acquired by Vox Media. Then he helped us to reserve tables, cofounding Resy in 2014, which catalyzed âreservation cultureâ by funneling the availability of more than 16,000 restaurants into one app. Today, he is immersed in his latest restaurant tech venture: Blackbird Labs, a shared loyalty program for eateries, where diners receive points in the form of crypto tokens. For Leventhal, the new venture is about more than finding a new way to blend technology and cuisine. At a time when many small restaurants face existential threats to their business model, he hopes Blackbird can provide them with a new level of economic savvyâand in doing so, keep alive the sort of venues he describes as his âhappy place.â On a somber August afternoon in Manhattan, Leventhal knows just the place to escape the showers darkening the city: NoHoâs dark and trendy Temple Bar, where menus and faces are read by candlelight, no matter the hour or season. With mahogany walls, a checkerboard floor, and a pay phone, the 1990s decor pays homage to the decade when the restaurant first gained notorietyâan era when the art world would flock inside to drink martinis out of its signature oversize glasses. We are at Temple Bar since it is one of Blackbirdâs early patrons, but also because it reflects his fascination with the spectacle of dining. âItâs actually not really about the food,â he admits, before gesturing to Andy Warholâs disco ball in the corner, speculating on the story behind it. âSeeing restaurants do what they do wellâI get really excited,â he says. But even as iconic spots like Temple Bar maintain their mystique, Leventhal also knows a hard truth: Profit margins of restaurants have been in steady decline. Food costs keep climbing, labor shortages persist post-pandemic, and rent has soared. Despite this, the number of new restaurant listings on Yelp hit anall-time highlast year. And in June, New York legislators evenpassed a billbanning reservation markets, where Resy bookings were selling for up to $1,000. âTheyâre more popular nowâthatâs whatâs curious about it,â he says. Given all this, Leventhal believes the restaurants he loves have a fighting chance if they can figure out how to make more money from customers walking through their doorâespecially the regular ones. In tech and crypto jargon, Blackbird is a decentralized eat-to-earn app. In practical terms, this means that users who frequent restaurants that use Blackbird earn what the app calls â$FLYpoints.â Another way to think of it is as an old-school loyalty rewards program built on newfangled blockchain technology. Transactions involving FLY are stamped onto a spin-off blockchain (a âlayer 2â in crypto speak) calledBasethat was built by crypto giantCoinbasewith the goal of reducing the stiff transaction costs that can come from using the primary Ethereum blockchain. Diners care no more about the nature of Blackbirdâs blockchain than they do about the wires transmitting theirVisapayments. But most will care about the perks they can receive from accumulating FLY points such as complimentary dishes, welcome drinks, and last-minute tables. Vance Spencer, cofounder of venture capital firm Framework Ventures, toldFortunethat he uses the app every day, as his favorite breakfast spot just so happens to be on the network. The perks? He has not paid for coffee in six months. As of July, users have also been able to pay the check in-app with FLY, via the payments network,Blackbird Pay. Blackbird builds upon what Leventhal has learned about dining culture throughout his career. That is, in cities like NYC, exclusivity is for sale. For example, a customer is more inclined to book a table if they can see itâs the last one, or a spot on the waitlist opens up at the final hour. Noticing this, Resy commodified the reservation itself: It âbecomes the main event,â the company wrote in a recentblog post. In the case of Temple Bar, the historic venueâs embrace of blockchain is undetectable to the naked eye. But thereâs one item, devoid of â90s charm, that gives it away: The so-called âcheck-inâ point. Blackbirders scan what appears to be a metal hockey puck upon arrival, to open a new check. The blockchain records where they ate, how they ordered, and what they spent, to estimate their lifetime value. Businesses, which pay $89 month to use Blackbird, can then spot when itâs worth offering a free drink or the best table. âIf you do that repeatedly, then youâre on the path to economic viability,â Leventhal says. Blackbirdâs thesis is compelling, especially when laid out by the charismatic and hyper-rational Leventhal. But on the front lines of the restaurants it is designed to save, the service is a work in progress. Moments before his arrival at Temple Bar, his publicist asks the server for âthe puckââonly to receive a look of bemusement in response. âIf I see the Blackbird device at a restaurant, I try to strike up a conversation about the app with the hosts or maÃ®tre dâ,â one user toldFortune, on the condition of anonymity due to working in crypto. âBut they usually have little to say about it.â Even if restaurant staff appear perplexed or indifferent to the app, it appears to be getting traction among a more critical constituency: diners. According to a Blackbird spokesperson, adoption has increased 10-fold during the year or so itâs been live and its roster now includes about 0.6% of the cityâs restaurants. Still, if Blackbird is going to induce customers to use it, a certain threshold of businesses must join, in order to incentivize downloads. âI havenât really benefited yet as a casual user,â the customer added. When asked about the adoption curve, Leventhal acknowledged there is a threshold to spark virality. While he did not disclose where that tipping point may lie, itâs âlower than people think,â he insists. âIn the meantime, trust us to curate great restaurants.â The task of persuading restaurants and users to sign up will likely be smoother given that Leventhal appears clear-eyed about the appeal of cryptoâor lack of itâfor the average diner. He acknowledges that blockchain is unlikely to be a selling point for the suits in Le Bernardin, or the It girls at Clandestino. âThat would not be a sell that works,â he says. And for the end user, the crypto element isnât noticeable. âCrypto people are just obsessed with putting the word âcryptoâ before things,â he says. Leventhal never set out to become a crypto founder. Before Blackbird, he was merely a âcurious observerâ of the industry. Rather, during the early days of the pandemic, in a conversation with venture capitalist Fred Wilson, partner of Union Square Ventures, he articulated a nebulous idea about creating a universal currency between restaurants. Crypto was only mentioned later, as the technology that made the most sense to bring it to life. Indeed, the blockchain component is what enables restaurants to share customer data and trade a single currency. Ostensibly, Blackbird is a loyalty program, but at its core is Leventhalâs vision for a shared, growing pool of capitalâFLYâs market capâthat is kept within the hospitality industry. Theoretically, this means a user can earn FLY by eating at one restaurant, but then deploying it another, where they never spend a dime. âRestaurants should prefer that customers spend their money on other restaurants, rather than on hotels or a first-class plane ticket. That way, itâs keeping value in the industry,â he says. Indeed, FLY cannot yet be traded between users, on exchanges, or used for off-app purchases, nor has Blackbird announced plans to do so. In the bruising business of hospitality, Leventhal is daring restaurants to love thy neighbor. If he pulls it off, date nights and birthday dinners may soon be settled with FLY.

    "news_title": "HBO documentary says Peter Todd created Bitcoin | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "Satoshi Nakamoto gave Bitcoin to the world in early 2009. His creation has since sparked a global rebellion against banks and governments, while its value has soared to well over $1 trillionâor as much as the combined market caps ofTeslaand JPMorgan.Satoshialso left us a mystery. Who is this mysterious person who vanished into the mists of the internet? And what became of his massive Bitcoin fortune? The search for Satoshi has now gone on for more than a decade. It has produced spectacular misfires, includingNewsweekâs infamous 2014cover storythat claimed to find Satoshi hiding in plain sight in Los Angeles. The discovery was wildly wrongâNewsweekhad instead found a confused older man whose last name happened to be Nakamotoâbut the episode would become another piece of Bitcoin lore. It also served as a textbook example of the perils of confirmation bias. Now comes Cullen Hoback, whose newdocumentaryMoney Electric: The Bitcoin Mysterypurports to unmask Satoshi Nakamoto once and for all. The film debuts at 9 p.m. PT onHBO, the network that in 2021 released HobackâsQ: Into the Storm,a close-up look at the QAnon conspiracy that credibly pointed to the people who orchestrated it. Hoback does not lack confidence (the trailer forMoney Electricproclaims the âinternetâs greatest mysteryâ will be revealed), and, by and large, his documentary is a good one. It avoids the pitfalls of most other crypto films.Money Electricis not a fan film by groupies looking to promote a token. Nor does it disparage and ridicule the crypto industry without trying to understand itâa common approach by would-be sophisticated critics. Instead, Hoback depicts a group of longtime Bitcoin advocates the way they see themselves: as the stewards of Satoshiâs gift, which gave the planet a form of money beyond the reach of intrusive, profligate governments. In this view, the villains are JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimonâthe Bitcoin-hating banker who is shown at the beginning and end ofMoney Electricâand Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator who allied with Wall Street against crypto. Meanwhile, the central characters inMoney Electricare those tied to Blockstream, a company that promotes the adoption of Bitcoin by individuals, companies, and even countries. At the outset of the film, we meetSamson Mow, a self-proclaimed Bitcoin ambassador who helps persuade the prince of Serbia and the president of El Salvador to embrace the currency. There is also Adam Back, the founder of Blockstream, who is famous for creating Hashcash, a precursor to Bitcoin. We also meet figures like Peter Todd, a Back acolyte and core Bitcoin developer, as well as Roger âBitcoin Jesusâ Ver, another influential early crypto figure who is currently facing charges for tax evasion. There are cameos as well from high-profile figures in the business world, including Jack Dorsey, theTwittercofounder who changed the name of his other company, Square, to Block as part of his dedication to crypto. The documentaryâs interviews with this roster of longtime Bitcoiners lends it authority, as does its succinct handling of major events in cryptoâs evolution. Those include the so-called block-size wars over Bitcoinâs architecture, the rise of Ethereum and alt-coins (âshitcoinsâ to detractors), and the U.S. governmentâs recent campaign to hobble the industry. Money Electricalso stands out from other crypto films because of its hefty production budgetâHoback shoots scenes in Malta, Canada, El Salvador, and numerous other placesâand because the director pushes in all his chips in claiming to identify Satoshi Nakamoto. Unfortunately, his bet is almost certainly wrong. Hobackâs quest to identify Satoshi begins in the right direction. He identifies the most prominent figures in a network of âcypherpunksâ who shared a passion for privacy and cryptography, and corresponded via a now-famous email list of the same name. It was through this mailing list, as well as an online forum calledBitcoinTalk, in addition to his famouswhite paper, that Satoshi shared his vision for Bitcoin. Early in the documentary, Hoback shows photos of the cypherpunks most closely associated with Bitcoin and who represent the most likely candidates to be Satoshi. They are Back, the creator of Blockstream and Hashcash, as well as other names familiar to longtime Bitcoiners: Hal Finney, Nick Szabo, and Wei Dai. Hoback makes a brief half-hearted effort to assess if these candidates are Satoshi, and then moves on toCraig Wright, an Australian charlatan who arrived on the crypto scene in 2016 withfalsifiedevidence to claim he invented Bitcoin. Mercifully, the filmmaker is not taken in and moves on to other candidates. AsMoney Electricprogresses, it zeroes in first on Back as a potential Satoshi and then on Backâs Blockstream protÃ©gÃ© and friend, Peter Todd. Todd is much younger than the other figures long identified as likely candidates, and would have been 19 or 20 years old at the time Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper. To make his case that Todd is Satoshi, Hoback seizes on his 2013 email exchange with an unknown figure named John Dillon about a technical upgrade to Bitcoin. Theemailswere leaked in 2016 and caused a minor uproar in crypto circles as it appeared that Dillon was a U.S. intelligence agent paying Todd as part of a plot to infiltrate Bitcoin. Hoback, however, makes a plausible case in the film that Todd and Dillon were one and the same personâand that Todd orchestrated the whole controversy to push for the upgrade. Hoback treats this as a eureka moment and, from this, seizes on a published exchange between Satoshi and Toddâone where Todd appears to correct the Bitcoin inventorâas proof that the latter must be Satoshi. In other words, Todd was again using his trick of replying to his own pseudonymous messages. To bolster the case, Hoback notes that Satoshiâs final communication appeared three days after the exchange, and that the writings of Todd, a Canadian, have included U.K.-style spellingsâsuch as âcolourâ and âchequeââthat are also found in texts by the Bitcoin inventor. In the filmâs climax, Hoback interviews Back and Todd in a broken-down castle in the Czech Republic (why they are there is unclear) and puts his theory to them directly. Todd never cleanly denies he is Satoshi but instead equivocates and appears to engage in gently trolling the filmmaker. Based on all this, Hoback and HBO have been hypingMoney Electricas a blockbuster exposÃ© that, after all these years, unmasks Satoshi. Oops. They should have instead remembered the lesson ofNewsweekand the perils of confirmation biasâthe all-too-common practice of interpreting new information to affirm existing beliefs, and rejecting that which contradicts them. There is, for now, no smoking gun that Peter Todd isnotSatoshi (though one may emerge soon enough). But it is notable that Toddâs name has never come up among crypto insiders as a likely candidate, and it is improbable that Hoback, a newcomer to the scene, would stumble on Bitcoinâs inventor so conveniently. Itâs also unlikely that someone barely out of high school who had yet to produce any publications of note would have both penned a document as complex as the Bitcoin white paper, and possessed the sophistication to implement what it set out. Finally, it stretches the imagination to think that Satoshiâwho fiercely shunned publicityâwould choose to participate in an HBO film exploring who created Bitcoin. When Todd tells Hoback in the film that âwe are all Satoshi,â the filmmaker should have simply recognized this as a familiar refrain from Bitcoin devotees and left it there. Hobackâs biggest mistake, though, is less his decision to zero in on Todd than to ignore a far more compelling theory about Satoshiâs identityâone that also aligns with Occamâs razor, the theorem that the simplest explanation is typically the correct one. The film began on the right track by highlighting the original cypherpunks, and thatâs where the search for Satoshi should have stayedâand in particular on a man named Nick Szabo, who Hoback introduces as a potential suspect, but then dismisses without a compelling reason. He ignores not only longtime whispers within the Bitcoin community, but also a stack of compelling evidence. This evidence includes the work of Nathaniel Popper, a formerNew York Timesjournalist and author ofDigital Gold,a close-up look at the early Bitcoin scene written much closer to the cryptocurrencyâs origin story. Popperâs reportingâincludingthis 2015 articleâpoints clearly in the direction of Szabo, and is supplemented by an academic study that conducted a regression analysis comparing Satoshiâs writing with that of potential Bitcoin inventors. The study found an uncanny match between Satoshi and Szabo, who also uses U.K. spelling. If you favor circumstantial evidence, thereâs also the fact that Nick Szaboâs initials, NS, are the inverse of SN. While Hobackâs big reveal is ultimately a misfire,Money Electricis still very much worth watching. The filmmaker does an admirable job of telling the story of cryptoâa phenomenon that exists almost entirely onlineâwith sophistication and passion, while making clever use of just enough graphics to convey timelines and technical portions. For crypto novices,Money Electricoffers a compelling story that explains Bitcoin in a fair and accurate fashion. For longtime crypto devotees, the documentary supplies plenty of familiar faces and a sympathetic take on their cultureâwhile also serving up yet another piece of lore that will be the subject of memes for years to come.

    "news_title": "Tether blasts report that stablecoin giant is under investigation for money laundering, sanctions violations | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "As the U.S. government mounted its bruising legal campaign against the crypto industry over the past two years, one company has evaded charges: Tether, the firm behind the eponymous stablecoin pegged to $1 that has become the go-to currency for a wide variety of blockchain transactions. Tether may no longer be avoiding serious scrutiny, however, as theWall Street Journalreportedon Friday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Tether violated money laundering and sanctions laws through its use by global criminal networks for drug trafficking, terrorism, and hacking. The company is adamantly denying the allegations. âIt is wildly irresponsible for WSJ to write articles with reckless allegations with such certainty when no authorities have gone on the record to confirm these rumors, and no sources are named,â said Tether in a statement toFortune. âThe article also carelessly glosses over Tetherâs well-documented and extensive dealings with law enforcement to crack down on bad actors seeking to misuse tether and other cryptocurrencies.â With a market cap of $120 billion, Tetherâs dollar-pegged stablecoin serves an integral role as the settlement currency for crypto trading and a hedge against volatility in many countries whose populations do not have access to dollars. Its hazy relationship with regulation, though, has led to ongoing questions about how exactly the stablecoin isbacked, and about the the use of Tetherfor criminal activities. Tether has faced previous probes, including by the Office of the New York Attorney General, whichhitTether and its parent company, iFinex, with an $18.5 million fine in 2021 for illegally operating in the state, as well as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, whichorderedTether to pay a $41 millionpenalty in 2021 for engaging in illegal transactions. The latest probe is the reported expansion of a Department of Justice investigation into whether Tetherâs backers committed bank fraud. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Founded in 2014 by Bitcoin enthusiasts, including the Mighty Duck actor Brock Pierce, Tether was one of the earliest iterations of a stablecoinâa type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to an underlying asset, such as a fiat currency or commodities such as gold or oil. The project was soon acquired by Bitfinex, one of the leading crypto exchanges. While Tether maintained a respectable volume, its usage rose during the bull market of 2021, when the explosion of trading fueled the need for a crypto-native settlement currency on exchanges that were less volatile than Bitcoin or Ethereum. While Tether faced competition from rivals including USDC, a stablecoin project backed byCircleandCoinbase, its offshore operations also made it an appealing option for people in countries outside the scope of the U.S., including in economies without access to the dollar, such as Argentina andLebanon. Despite Tetherâs astronomic growth, the firm also faced continued questions about its management, including whether the stablecoin was actually fully backed by dollars. Aninvestigationby Bloomberg in 2021 revealed that a good portion of Tetherâs reserves were held in risky assets such as commercial paper from Chinese companies. The company has insisted it no longer engages in this practice. Still, Tether has yet to undergo a traditional audit due to what it says is difficulty in persuading major accounting firms to take it on as a client. Blockchain analytics firms have also tied Tether to global criminal networks, especially with a version of the stablecoin issued on the Tron blockchain. A reportpublishedearlier this year by TRM Labs found that Tron hosted 45% of all illicit volume in 2023, with more than half of Tetherâs current market cap hosted on Tron. Tether has touted initiatives to combat criminal usage and freeze addresses associated with illicit behavior. In September, Tether and Tronannounceda new partnership with TRM Labs called the T3 Financial Crime Unit. The open questions whirling around Tether have not hindered its growth, especially after its rival USDCbriefly lostits $1 peg on secondary markets during the banking crisis of March 2023. Even with the launch of new stablecoins from companies such asPayPal, Tether continues to dominate the sector. The company also has the support of Howard Lutnick, the CEO of the financial services giant Cantor Fitzgerald, which manages some of Tetherâs backing assets. Lutnick is a major economic advisor to former president Donald Trump. The newly reported probe into Tetherâs business, however, raises the risk of disruption for both the company and the crypto sector as a whole, similar to what occurred following the collapse of the fraudulent FTX exchange in November 2022. Tether is arguably more integral to the crypto industry than FTX as its stablecoin underpins the global crypto economy. Potential charges could echo the DOJ and Treasury Departmentâs case against Binance, which focused on money laundering and sanctions violations by the exchange thanks to the activity of terrorist and drug trafficking networks. Tether has been linked to groups including Hamas and Russian arms dealers have been linked. âThere is no indication that Tether is under investigation,â Tether CEO Paolo Ardoinopostedon X after the news broke. âWSJ is regurgitating old noise.

    "news_title": "Stripe $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin start-up Bridge | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged 1:1 to the value of fiat-currency like the dollar, have emerged as one of the most effective ways to settle international payments using blockchain, prompting large companies likeVisaandPayPalto integrate them into their services. The latest payment giant to advance stablecoin adoption isStripe, which announced the acquisition of start-up Bridge on Monday. The $1.1 billion acquisition was originallyannouncedon Sunday byTechCrunchfounder Michael Arrington onXand later confirmed by both Stripe and Bridge. The deal is the largest crypto acquisition by a major payments company. In hispostconfirming the acquisition, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison called stablecoins âroom-temperature superconductorsâ â a hypothetical material that, if discovered, could revolutionize the way we generate energyâ for financial services. âStablecoins represent an entirely new payments platform. Realizing the potential of this platform will be a decades-long journey,â Bridge said in a blogpost. âAnd as weâve gotten to know the Stripe team, itâs become clear that we both share a vision for whatâs possible with stablecoins and an excitement around the opportunity to create and build this future.â Owing to their ability to offer low fees and instant settlement, stablecoins have taken off over the past two years, reaching a market cap of $173 billion. Especially outside of the U.S, stablecoins like Tether and USDC which are backed by the U.S. dollar, have become widely popular. This growth tracks the demand for dollar-dominated stablecoins in areas of the world with currency volatility where people seek to preserve the value of their assets. Despite their surging popularity, it is still a challenge to find efficient on and off ramps for companies who want to use stablecoins to move fiat currencies into the crypto ecosystem. Bridge seeks to solve this problem. Co-founders Zach Abrams and Sean Yu are veterans of the fintech industry with experience from Square andCoinbase. Their company seeks to advance stablecoin infrastructure by aggregating a set of APIsâ a set of rules or protocols that enable different software to communicateâ to allow developers to incorporate stablecoin technology into their daily operations. The companyannouncedthey had raised a total of $58 million from prominent venture capital firms including Sequoia, Ribbit, Index and Haun Ventures, in August. At the time, Bridge had processed over $5 billion in annualized payment volume. Now, the startup will have the resources, reach and expertise of the $70 billion payments company Stripe. âWe built Bridge to solve our most vexing global financial challenges; to pull a more connected world forward; to give everyone more economic choice,â Abramssaidon X. âWeâre thrilled to be joining forces with Stripe to fully realize these ambitions.â Â© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "news_title": "Binance exec released from Nigerian prison after 8 month detention | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "After pleading for medical attention for months, Binance employee and former U.S. Special Agent Tigran Gambaryan has finally been granted freedom by the Nigerian government. On Wednesday, a court in Nigeria ordered Gambaryan to be released from prison after the government dropped money laundering charges against him. Gambaryan has been wrongfully detained in Nigeria sinceFebruarywhen the country decided to take aim at crypto giant Binance and seized the companyâs head of financial crime compliance in an apparent bid for political leverage During his eight month imprisonment, Gambaryan has developed multiple serious ailments including malaria, pneumonia and complications from a herniated disk in his back that has made it difficult to walk andrequiresâhigh-risk specialized surgery.â Nigeriaâs Economic and Financial Crimes Commission dropped the case against him on grounds of his deteriorating health, but denied a request for a formalacquittal. Earlier this month, Gambaryanâs lawyerspleadedwith the court to grant him bail to receive medical treatment for the urgent herniated disk but the request was denied. The money laundering charges were dropped to allow Gambaryan to get medical attention, an EFCC lawyer toldReuters, but âdiplomatic arrangementsâ also aided in securing his release. Throughout his detention, his wife has been a fervent advocate for his freedom and Binance has promised to cooperate with the Nigerian government. More recently, the United States has turned up the heat on Nigeria, with numerouslawmakerscalling his detention unjust, advocating for his release and visiting him in prison. In June, FBI director Chistopher Wray visited the country on an unrelated matter and Nigeria dropped some charges against Gambaryan soon after. The EFCC will continue with its criminal prosecution of Binance, the worldâs largest crypto exchange, for allegedly evading taxes and laundering $35 million. The wrongful detention of Gambaryan and charges against Binance come as Nigeria is in the midst of a debilitating economic crisis. The local currency, the naira, has experienced a free-fall that the government repeatedly blames on the rise of cryptocurrencies. The government posits that Binance facilitated the collapse by allowing users to transfer assets out of the local currency. Gambaryan was arrested during what was supposed to be a business trip to Nigeria to discuss the ongoing feud and potentially settle the dispute. Instead, the executive was detained alongside a fellow employee, who managed toescapeNigerian custody in March. Â© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

    "news_title": "Fitness app Moonwalk that pays crypto for step tracking raises $3.4 million from Hack VC | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "Do you wear yourAppleor Garmin watch to track your steps and strive to reach 10,000 everyday? Now, you can get paid for it. Moonwalk Fitness, an app that incentivizes healthy habits by rewarding users with crypto, has raised $3.4 million in seed funding from lead investor Hack VC with contributions from Binance Labs, Reciprocal Ventures and co-founder of Solana Raj Gokal. âI call it gamified accountability,â Caitlin Cook, head of growth and the face of MoonWalk Fitness, toldFortune, âJust trying to help people hold themselves to the goals they set for themselves.â The app âgamifiesâ fitness by allowing users to challenge friends, family or strangers to daily competitions. The user who sets up the challenge can specify parameters including how many days the competition lasts, the daily step goal and how much each player must deposit to enter. Players can submit a deposit in USDC, Solana or Bonkâ a Solana-based memecoin. If you fail to reach the daily step count you lose your deposit and it is pooled and evenly distributed amongst those who did achieve the goal. If you successfully complete the daily challenges, you get your deposit back and win a portion of the pooled money. The app is built on the Solana blockchain and is easily integrated into popular fitness trackers like the FitBit, Apple Watch and Garmin. While MoonWalk will eventually be available on mobile, it is currently only accessible through a web browser. Once the mobile app is live, users will be able to buy credits with Apple Pay or a credit card in addition to a crypto wallet, Cook said. Crypto fitness apps have tried to capture a sustainable user base since as far back as 2015.StepNis a similar platform that requires users to purchase in-game NFTs to participate. MoonWalk differs from these other crypto fitness apps because it pays users with mainstream tokens rather than offering rewards with a new currency native to the platform, Cook said. âI think MoonWalk is a little bit different in terms of game mechanics, where itâs very clear where any sort of winnings are coming from, and itâs directly from other players,â Cook said, ââ¦Itâs like the most liquid, highly used on-chain assets and soon itâs going to be supported by fiat as well.â MoonWalk strives to appeal to a wider audience of non-native users by stripping away the complexities that come with using crypto. âThe mission for the project and who weâre going for is very focused on the mainstream consumer and building a product that theyâll actually want to use and not be too intimidated by, having the blockchain part of it fall to the backdrop,â Cook said. The app taps into a broader trend known as âconsumer cryptoâ â the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology by everyday consumers for activities like gaming, fashion, finance, music, and art. âMoonwalk sits at the intersection of fitness and consumer crypto, unlocking an entirely new class of users. A slick mobile app will abstract crypto elements away from users, fostering simple onboarding and high retention,â Hack VC partner Roshun Patel said in a statement. Currently, the app only supports steps tracking but, Cook said, the company will use the funding raised in this seed round to expand the appâs capabilities to support all different types of fitness activities. The funding will also be used to continue developing IOS and Android versions of the application, she said. Â© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

    "news_title": "Microsoft tells shareholders to reject call to invest corporate cash in Bitcoin | Fortune Crypto",
    "news_content": "As the year comes to an end,Microsoftplans to hold its annual shareholder meeting on December 10th. On this yearâs list of âvoting itemsâ for shareholders is a proposal to diversify Microsoftâs assets and increase shareholder value by investing in Bitcoin, according to a Securities and Exchange Commissionfilingpublished on Thursday. The companyâs board of directors is urging shareholders to vote against it. The proposal titled âAssessment of Investing in Bitcoinâ posits that Microsoftâs current investment in corporate bonds barely outpaces inflation rates and suggests that the company should consider diversifying their assets with Bitcoin, an âexcellent, if not the best, hedge against inflation.â âTherefore, in inflationary times like these, corporations shouldâand perhaps have a fiduciary duty toâto diversify their balance sheets with assets that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile in the short-term,â the proposal said. Beneath the proposal is a section labeled âBoard Recommendationâ in which Microsoftâs board of directors advises shareholders to vote against the proposal. The board explains that the company does not need to assess investing in Bitcoin because âMicrosoftâs management already carefully considers this topic,â the filing said. The tech giant, whoselargestshareholders areVanguard,BlackRockandState Street, says it has a Global Treasury and Investment Services team that regularly evaluates a vast array of potential investments to effectively diversify Microsoftâs assets and protect shareholders from inflation. This team has considered Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in past evaluations, Microsoft said in the filing. âMicrosoft has strong and appropriate processes in place to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for long-term benefit of shareholders and this requested public assessment is unwarranted,â the filing said. The proposal was set forth by The National Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank. The organization serves as an advisory board member of Project 2025, a far-right policy initiative to expand presidential power and impose a traditionalist social order under the next Republican administration. The proposal notes that while the company should consider investing in Bitcoin, it should not risk shareholder value by investing too much of their assets in the cryptocurrency. The organization suggests that Microsoft âevaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 1% of its assets in Bitcoin.â This proposal comes as MicroStrategy, another large tech company, reaches anew highof $241 this year as the companyâs strategic pivot toward Bitcoin investment pays off handsomely. The company has amassed 252,220 Bitcoins since 2020, worth about $17 billion. This has led MicroStrategyâs stock to surge 250% over the past year while Microsoft is up 16%.
