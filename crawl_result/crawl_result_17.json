    "news_title": "What is Cryptocurrency? Beginner's Guide",
    "news_content": "Cryptocurrency is a virtual currency that uses cryptographic mathematics to securely send coins from one party to another. It is designed as an entirely digital alternative to fiat currency (like AUD) that is printed and controlled by an authoritative figure. Most digital currencies leverage a distributed ledger called “blockchain technology”. This allows control of cryptocurrencies to be spread among hundreds (or thousands) of participants, rather than in the hands of a select few financial institutions like with fiat currency. Cryptocurrency was born out of the 2009 Global Financial Crisis amid growing distrust of centralised banking systems and the power they held. As a response, an anonymous developer(s) known only as Satoshi Nakamoto released the world’s first cryptocurrency and associated blockchain, Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin was the first official digital currency that could be transferred between two people, the concept of a virtual, decentralised currency was first floated in 1983 by David Chaum. The industry has come a long way since then. Today, there are over 25,000 different cryptocurrencies – some with almost the exact same coding framework as Bitcoin’s blockchain, but with minor adjustments. We’ve all heard the stories of people who became teenage millionaires by purchasing Bitcoin. Some estimates suggest that there are over 88K crypto millionaires across the globe. There are several ways to make money from crypto, but only a couple apply to beginners. Those new to the industry should stick to holding assets with strong development backgrounds, excellent use cases and long-term viability. If cryptocurrencies see greater adoption, and eventually demand, their spot price will likely increase and those holding the assets will profit from their growth. Novice investors can also make money from staking cryptocurrencies on-chain, locking up digital assets in a savings account. Experienced traders can leverage the advantages of crypto’s 24/7 and highly volatile market to create all sorts of money-making opportunities. However, trading with a short-term outlook is not recommended for beginners. Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision for Bitcoin (and blockchain technology) was rather simple. They designed BTC as an anonymous means of exchange that didn’t require an intermediary like a bank. However, as the ecosystem has evolved, so too has the potential applications. Cryptocurrencies can now be used for: And much more. Bitcoin has been a household name for quite some time now, and is by far the most popular cryptocurrency. Its market cap and trading volume dwarfs that of any other non-stablecoin.

This blockchain easily has the biggest ecosystem, hosting thousands of decentralised applications and projects.Checkout more Ethereum resources below: Dogecoin is another old-school crypto project that has gained mainstream attention. Although the cryptocurrency doesn’t have a huge range of functions, the cultural impact of DOGE is undeniable.

That’s why it’s so important for new investors to research reputable exchanges – only they can determine which platform is best suited to their unique financial goals. Australians wanting to keep things simple should stick to a local-based crypto exchange. Such platforms fall under the thumb of the Australian Government and must abide by stringent financial regulations to operate in the country. Additionally, local exchanges accept AUD deposits and withdrawals, are less of a target for hackers, and often boast an Australian customer support team. Swyftx is an excellent example of a secure, trustworthy Australian exchange with competitive fees. Other factors worth considering include: We have compared thebest crypto exchanges in Australiafor more information. Once we’ve decided on a trustworthy and securecryptocurrency exchange, it’s time to learn how to buy crypto. We will useSwyftxas our platform of choice for this demonstration, but there are several other fantastic exchanges that also work. You can view our in-depthreview of Swyftxfor more details. Creating an account on most modern exchanges is usually very straightforward. Head to the website’s home page and select “Sign Up”, “Start Trading” or a similar call-to-action. New users will be presented with a standard application form that requests basic personal information, including mobile number, date of birth, email address and nationality. Ensure you can access a smartphone and email address to move forward as quickly as possible. Verify the email and mobile number through a six-digit code sent to each address and move onto the final part of this step – deciding on a password. Make sure to use a unique passcode with special characters, capitals and numbers. Now that our Swyftx (or other exchange) account is ready to rock and roll, it’s time to deposit funds. Due to the Australian Government’s Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, users must verify their identity before depositing AUD. New users can begin this process by selecting “Verification” from the settings dashboard. It’s a good idea to have government-issued documentation such as a driver’s license or passport on hand to speed up this process. New accounts must provide images of these documents to the exchange before depositing AUD (or another fiat currency). All up, the verification process should only take five to ten minutes. Once our new account is verified, we’re ready to deposit AUD. Most Australian exchanges like Swyftx support several fast and free deposit methods, giving new users plenty of flexibility for funding their accounts. Click “Deposit” from anywhere on the platform and select the asset being deposited – for most, this will be Australian Dollars (AUD). Choose a deposit method – Swyftx offers POLi, PayID, Debit/credit card or bank transfer – and input the amount of cash to be transferred. Confirm that the transaction and the exchange account should be funded within 48 hours (depending on the deposit method used). Possibly the most important decision any investor must make iswhat to actually invest in.New users should reflect on a myriad of factors that can influence the long-term viability of each potential investment (i.e., project developers, historic performance, real-world functionality). Generally, it is recommended that beginners start off with safer options like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) before branching out into more speculative projects. Navigate to the exchange’s trading hub to bring up a list of supported cryptocurrencies. Finding the coin you want to buy is easy – you can either scroll through the list or simply search for the asset’s name. Now that we’ve chosen and located the crypto we wish to buy, it’s time to complete the transaction. Select “Buy” to bring up the trading interface. Here, we can decide how much cryptocurrency we wish to buy. Once everything looks good, simply review and confirm the transaction. That’s it! The newly purchased cryptocurrency should hit your exchange account within a few minutes. Owning crypto coins directly is one of many ways for investors to expose themselves to the blockchain market. The main advantage of using an alternative is avoiding storing and managing a potentially volatile crypto portfolio. A few companies operating in the crypto space offer shares on public stock markets. Perhaps the most prominent example is Coinbase, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. The US-based company went public in 2021 and was the first-ever exchange start-up to sell shares on the stock market. Like the crypto market, Coinbase’s stock has experienced a rough time since its initial public offering (IPO) and is down 50+%. Another option is to stick to crypto-connected businesses that aren’t exclusively associated with the blockchain industry. A great example is MicroStrategy Inc., a multi-national analytics company that has invested in over 150,000 BTC. Therefore, investing in the stock (Ticker: MSTR) provides exposure to their massive BTC holdingsandother unrelated business operations. Like Coinbase and the broader crypto market, MSTR hasn’t performed super well since 2021 – but the stock is up 200+% since its inception in the early 2000s. Other crypto-connected companies that offer public stocks include: Interested investors can buy these stocks via their preferred international stockbroker. Rather than purchasing the stock of a single company connected to the crypto industry, investors should also consider exchange-traded funds. These are baskets of assets (rather than just one) that usually track the price of an underlying index, commodity or security. Australian investors aren’t spoiled for choice when it comes to crypto ETFs. The only option on the ASX comes from wealth manager BetaShares, who released the Crypto Innovators ETF (ASX : CRYP) in 2021. This fund doesn’t track the price of a specific crypto asset. Rather, it provides exposure to several blockchain-related companies (such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy). Investors can also consider a Bitcoin/Ethereum Futures ETF (like 21Shares Bitcoin ETF) through an international stockbroker. These funds intend to track the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, they do not actually expose investors to actual BTC. Instead, futures ETFs comprise futures contracts – agreements to buy and sell BTC/ETH at a specific price on a specific date. Therefore, such ETFs don’t always accurately mirror the price movements of Bitcoin and can also come with a premium attached. However, it may not be long until Australian investorscanpurchase Bitcoin ETFs that hold BTC. Several major US institutions like BlackRock and Invesco have filed applications to release their very own spot Bitcoin ETFs. These funds better reflect the day-to-day movements of the BTC market, and it appears likely that a few will be approved before the end of 2023. Let’s be honest. Most people buy cryptocurrency because they want to spin a profit. Since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, its price has increased by a ridiculous 4 million percent. And while historical performance isn’t a guarantee of future price movements, new investors are banking on the continuation of these crazy returns. Many cryptocurrencies have excellent use cases in theory but still need to achieve widespread adoption. So, crypto investors often speculate that the potentially groundbreaking technology of certain blockchain projects will break into the mainstream in the coming years. Such an event would likely result in significant price gains. Related:How to buy Bitcoin in Australia. Inflation is the reality of any government-printed fiat currency. Generally, central banks target an inflation rate of 3% per year. This means that every AUD loses 3% of its spending power yearly – typically via products like energy, groceries or fuel becoming more expensive. In the early 2020s, governments worldwide implemented record-low interest rates to help combat the difficulties of the Covid-19 pandemic. While this helped jolt the economy in the short term, it caused inflation to run rampant and fiat currencies like the AUD to become debased. Holding cash is an investment position like any other. So, when inflation is sky-high, an AUD bank account could lose 6-8% annually. This is why Bitcoin and other deflationary cryptocurrencies are often used to hedge against inflation. BTC has a limited supply of 21 million, as opposed to AUD, an inflationary currency with no maximum supply. As more and more BTC is mined, it stands to reason upward pressure on the coin’s price will follow (this assumes demand remains the same, which is impossible to predict). Cryptocurrency is so much more than coins that people invest in. It’s a trillion-dollar sector loaded with thousands of ambitious projects. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionise modern databases. It can shake up the supply chain, pressure banks to reduce their monopolies and democratise governance among big and small businesses. A lot is happening in the crypto world – and many people buy tokens just to get a taste. NFT-based gaming is a perfect example – the top games can see unique active wallets (UAW) of over 100,000. These burgeoning communities are often built around an in-game economy, for instance, AXS, the token used in the Pokemon-esque release Axie Infinity. Others may buy SAND tokens to pay for unique metaverse experiences via The Sandbox gaming platform. The blockchain and crypto space is constantly evolving, with new sectors popping up constantly. For instance, a hot topic right is the tokenisation of real world assets (RWA). CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink has stated that he sees this a huge use case of crypto and one that will still large adoption in years to come. Cryptocurrency – specifically decentralised finance – roared into the public’s eye in 2021 as inflation started taking hold of the global economy. Banks were slow to adjust their interest rates, leading investors to consider alternatives to protect their wealth. One potential alternative was DeFi, as it provided multiple ways to earn passive income on top of superior rates to your average high-interest savings account. The easiest way for investors to accrue passive income is through a basic lending protocol. These are available on major centralised exchanges and often provide annual yields of 4-10% – making it a fast and easy earning method. A common strategy is to convert fiat currency like AUD into a stablecoin. Therefore, the investor’s portfolio isn’t subject to the crypto market’s wild swings while benefiting from its better yields. More advanced users can dive into the breadth of earning options available in the DeFi ecosystem. Staking on-chain has two advantages – contributing to a blockchain’s safety while generating cash on the side. Some investors even try their luck with yield farming. This complex earning mechanism takes advantage of short-term liquidity pool imbalances. Either way, none of these unique and productive income-generation techniques are accessible without first buying cryptocurrency. Yes, but only a handful of exchanges in Australia offer support for AUD PayPal purchases. Australian residents can not yet buy, sell, or hold major cryptocurrencies with their PayPal accounts, unlike those from the UK and the US. It is likely that PayPal will introduce crypto integration for Australian customers in the coming years. Beginner investors in Australia should stick to local, trusted and low-fee exchanges. Local exchanges tend to have better customer support and must abide by all regulations handed down by the Australian government. Swyftx is an Australian-based, cost-effective trading platform that is well-respected among the crypto community. Yes, being able to buy crypto with credit card is becoming more and more common among centralised exchanges. Several major trading platforms in Australia support buying crypto with a credit or debit card, such as Swyftx and Coinspot. It’s worth noting that buying digital assets with a credit card can be quite expensive, with fees of 2.5%+. Buying from Australian-based exchanges with a reputation for excellent customer service and security is the safest way to build a crypto portfolio. Keep an eye out for platforms with ISO27001 certification, such as Swyftx, Coinspot and Independent Reserve. Yes, buying, selling and tradingcryptois legalin Australia. Although cryptocurrency is not accepted as legal tender, some merchants do accept payments in specific digital currencies like BTC or ETH.

    "news_title": "Best Crypto Exchanges in Australia in 2024",
    "news_content": "In 2024, there are many available options for Aussies looking for an easy-to-use, secure and trusted crypto exchange. Swyftx is our pick for the best crypto exchange in Australia. The platform pairs competitive trading fees with ISO27001 certification and excellent customer support renowned among the crypto community. Coinspot, Coinjar and Independent Reserve are all great Australian options, whilst international exchanges like Gateio, Binance and Bybit offer the lowest fees on trading. Swyftx is an Australian-based crypto exchange that launched in 2018. Founded by Alex Harper and Angus Goldman, the trading platform has seen massive growth over the last couple of years and has built a 600,000+ strong customer base. It’s considered a beginner-centric exchange due to its easy-to-navigate interface, great learning resources and features like demo mode. 0.1-0.6% Bank transfer: $0PayID: $0Credit card: 1.99% 0% 400+ Brisbane, Australia 3    The platform offers a flat transaction fee of just 0.6%. Swyftx is also transparent with its spreads, which range between 0.2 and 0.8%. Most competitors – especially in the Australian market – do not disclose their spreads, and investors can easily incur fees of over 2% per trade without even knowing it.   Swyftx is registered with the Australian regulatory body AUSTRAC. This means they abide by all financial frameworks, including KYC and AML policies. The company also supports advanced security measures such as 2-Factor Authentification (2FA) and breached password detection.           Swyftx review Gate.io is one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, packed to the brim with advanced trading features and earning opportunities. The platform has been operational for over a decade after being founded in China in 2013 and has helped 14M+ people build their digital currency portfolios. As a primarily crypto-to-crypto exchange, Gate.io is renowned among the community for perhaps the largest list of supported altcoins on the market. 0-0.1% Crypto: NoneThird-party fiat deposit: Varies between 1-5% Varies 2300+ Cayman Islands 15   Important:You cannot deposit AUD into Gate.io. To do this you will need to use an Australian exchange like Swyftx to onboard AUD and then purchase an asset like BTC or USDT to then send to your Gate.io wallet.  Gate.io is one of the crypto industry’s longest-running exchanges, serving millions of customers since its creation over a decade ago. The platform is a popular choice for professional traders due to its low fees and advanced features – Gate.io often boasts AUD $8B+ of 24-hour trading volume. Gate.io is flush with features, including ample earning possibilities, a new project launchpad and even social media elements. Experienced customers can take advantage of a modern trading interface with TradingView integration and order book depth, while beginners will enjoy the “Express Buy” function.    A huge appeal of Gate.io is its massive list of cryptocurrencies, with 1,700 and counting currently available for trade. While investors on competing platforms often have to wait months (sometimes years!) for obscure altcoins to be listed, Gate.io customers can often access such tokens before they’ve pumped beyond reach.         Gate.io’s fees vary depending on what asset you’re using, your trading volume and more.  Accounts with minimal trading volume and asset value can trade on the spot market for 0.1% per transaction. This fee can fall as low as 0% for high-net-worth individuals on Gate.io.  Deposit fees for all cryptocurrencies are free, while withdrawal fees vary. Withdrawing USDT and ETH incurs a cost of approximately AUD $0.75, while BTC costs $1.65 per withdrawal.  Created by Brian Armstrong in 2012, Coinbase is one of the United States’ oldest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform is renowned for its excellent user interface, wide range of useful features and superb security measures. Coinbase also manages one of the industry’s leading smartphone apps, which boasts millions of downloads and lets investors manage their crypto portfolios on the go. Coinbase is registered with AUSTRAC and complies with all relevant financial requirements. PayID: $0Bank Transfer: $0Osko: $0Credit/debit card: 3.99% 0% 150+ San Francisco 20+    Of particular note is Coinbase’s Earn hub, which allows customers to lock up their hard-earned crypto tokens in exchange for up to 10% APY. It’s worth noting that Coinbase isn’t the most cost-effective platform, with its flat trading fee of 1% made worse by anecdotes of expensive spreads. More experienced traders can work around these costs by using the Coinbase Advanced Exchange, which charges trading fees as low as 0.4%.    Coinbase supports a range of useful features, including:        Coinbase is currently in an ongoing legal battle with the SEC in the United States over the listing of several unregistered securities. Additionally, Coinbase was selected by 8 of 9 ETH ETF issuers (i.e. BlackRock, Fidelity etc.) as a trusted partner and custodian through it’s newly launched Coinbase Prime institutional focused platform.   OKX is an advanced cryptocurrency exchange with modern trading features perfect for investors on the cutting edge. The platform was founded in 2017 by Star Xu in China, but relocated amid the nation’s crackdown on crypto-related products. OKX is often used to trade derivatives, but also has an in-depth spot market for less experienced crypto traders. Users can choose from hundreds of trading pairs, including all major tokens like BTC, ETH, USDT, etc. OKX is not officially registered with AUSTRAC, but the company plans to pursue this over the coming years. 0.005-0.1% Payment gateway (Banxa/MoonPay): Varies, typically 1%+P2P Bank transfer: FreeCredit/debit card: 3.5-5% P2P marketplace: FreePayment gateway (Banxa/MoonPay): Varies, typically 1%+ 350+ Victoria, Seychelles 30+    OKX came onto the scene in the late 2010s before officially rebranding to the simpler OKX. This change in style reflects the cryptocurrency exchange’s modus operandi – offer a sleek, clean and modern trading platform. At its heart, OKX is for the more experienced crypto traders. The exchange offers impressive features, including bots, copy trading and derivatives trading.   Trading is available with a maximum transaction fee of just 0.1%, which can drop as low as 0.005%. High-volume traders can see savings in the thousands by using a low-fee platform like OKX over a local but more expensive alternative. The crypto novices can find a home at OKX, too.Buying Bitcoinor 20+ other major tokens through the platform’s Quick Buy scheme is incredibly easy and convenient. Investors can attach their credit/debit card, Apple or Google Pay accounts, and instantly add new coins to their portfolio. Such a purchase method requires third-party providers, which makes it much more expensive than trading crypto on the spot market. However, as OKX doesn’t support AUD deposits – outside of using the P2P marketplace – it is likely more cost-efficient for new investors to start building a portfolio elsewhere. Then, once more experienced, they can move across some of their assets and benefit from OKX’s range of trading features.           OKX hasn’t launched any major new features in 2024 but have offered traders a new an improved trading experience thanks to: Crypto.com emerged in 2016 as a Hong Kong-based exchange founded by Bobby Bao, Gary Or, Kris Marszalek and Rafael Melo. After a few formative months, the platform became one of the industry’s most popular trading hubs for new and experienced crypto users. Much of its newfound status came from an intensive and targeted advertising campaign, including partnerships with Matt Damon, the Australian Football League, and purchasing naming rights to Los Angeles’ top sporting stadium. 0-0.075% Bank transfer: $0Osko: $0PayID: $0Credit/debit card (instant purchase): 3.5% None (can vary) 250+ Singapore 30+    Crypto.com is an interesting exchange, as it comes with two distinct platforms. The first is the smartphone application, intended for beginners to start building their crypto portfolios. The application offers several basic services, including the ability to instantly buy/sell crypto with a card, earn passive income on certain assets, and receive rewards for holding CRO.   Australians can also benefit from the Crypto.com credit card, which allows them to spend their crypto holdings at EFTPOS machines as though it were fiat currency. The card also comes with cashback and subscription promotions, which can vary from month to month.         Binance launched in 2017 and has quickly catapulted to prominence and now sits as the world’s most popular cryptocurrency platform. Binance regularly leads the industry in terms of trading volume and liquidity. The exchange is renowned for its list of altcoins, features, and international presence. Recently, Binance was debanked by its Australian banking partner, meaning they can no longer accept AUD deposits. 0.1% Cannot deposit AUD Cannot withdraw AUD 500+ Caymen Islands 10+    Binance isn’t the oldest exchange in the crypto scene after being founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao (CZ). But what the exchange lacks in duration, it makes up for in popularity. Binance is by far the world’s most popular cryptocurrency exchange, beating out all competitors in terms of 24-hour trading volume. The website is renowned for its massive list of features – Binance is more of a decentralised ecosystem than a simple trading platform. Users can trade over 700 crypto assets, earn passive income on hundreds, support up-and-coming blockchain projects or mint their own NFTs. Binance’s low fees, industry-leading range of features and immense global liquidity make it a great choice for crypto investors of all skill levels.    Unfortunately, the Binance platform’s efficacy for Australians was harmed significantly in June 2023, when the business stopped supporting AUD deposits and withdrawals. Alongside this development, Binance ceased all trading pairs that used AUD. Major banking institutions such as Westpac had “barred clients from trading on Binance”. At the same time, payment providers PayID also ceased support for transferring AUD to Binance.  Binance is searching for new suppliers to bridge the gap between Australian customers and the popular trading platform. Until then, access for AUD users will be limited. Australian traders can still benefit from using Binance, however, they now must deposit cryptocurrency or use the rather expensive bank/credit card “instant buy” feature.   Binance is regarded as the industry’s most feature-laden exchange. And for the most part, the platform lives up to this reputation.           View our fullBinance review. CoinSpot is Australia’s biggest exchange with over 2.5 million users nationwide. Founded in 2013, CoinSpot is also one of Australia’s oldest and most established exchanges. Similar to Swyftx, the platform takes a beginner-friendly approach with its sleek interface and simple navigation. 1% for instant buy and sell orders Bank transfer, PayID: NoneBPAY: 0.9%Cash: 2.5%Card: 2.58% $0 on AUD withdrawals 460+ Melbourne, Australia 1   CoinSpot was one of the first cryptocurrency exchanges on the Australian scene. The platform was founded in 2013, and in a decade of operation has built a reputation as a trustworthy and feature-rich exchange. The smooth user interface and easy-to-use buy/sell mechanism make CoinSpot a beginner-targeted exchange, although there’s plenty for intermediate crypto investors too. The CoinSpot developers have steadily added new features to the site, including an NFT marketplace and an earning hub. As an Australian-based exchange with an eye to simplicity, CoinSpot is an excellent choice for crypto newcomers looking to build the foundations of a portfolio.   Coinspot charges relatively high “instant buy” fees (1%) and with spreads reportedly ranging between 1-4%.         Bybit was founded in 2018 by experienced trader and broker Ben Zhou. The platform aimed to bring advanced trading tools to the young and underdeveloped crypto market. For years, investing in crypto was limited to simply buying, selling and swapping digital currencies. Bybit was one of the first platforms to offer its customers a wide range of crypto derivatives, who can trade them with up to 100x leverage. Bybit is not registered with AUSTRAC, meaning Australian customers cannot directly deposit AUD.         0.1% Cryptocurrency: $0 (although standard network fees will apply) Cryptocurrency: $0 (although standard network fees will apply) 150+ Dubai 0    Bybit is one of the most popular exchanges in the industry for advanced investors. The platform comes with several in-depth trading tools, including customisable charts, a copy trading mechanism and derivatives for most major digital currencies. Investors can also add stop-loss or take-profit triggers to their orders, vital for minimising risk when trading with leverage. Bybit is also packed with useful features, security measures and a pretty well-received smartphone application. The major pitfall of the platform is two-pronged – fiat deposits aren’t directly handled by the Bybit exchange, meaning investors expose themselves to third-party fees and risks. On top of this, the massive range of features and trading options makes Bybit better suited for more experienced traders.             CoinJar is Australia’s longest-running crypto exchange, with the platform bursting onto the scene over a decade ago in 2013. The team has helped over 600,000 Australians begin building their crypto portfolios with all the basics – Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. The platform is AUSTRAC registered and adheres to all regulatory requirements. In its years operating in Australia, CoinJar has built a reputation as a trustworthy and secure exchange perfect for beginners and intermediate investors.              1% instant orders0.1% exchange orders PayID/Osko: $0Bank transfer: $0Cash deposit: 1.5%SEPA deposit: $0 $0 60+ Melbourne 4    CoinJar offers a smaller list of crypto assets than most modern-day competitors, but this is not necessarily bad. It is a simple, beginner-friendly platform that doesn’t tend to bother with speculative altcoins. Customers can choose from the basic CoinJar platform (perfect for getting started) or the dedicated CoinJar exchange (excellent for intermediate traders). The main CoinJar platform can get a little pricey – with spot trading fees a flat 1% – but is a convenient option for a no-frills trading experience. The CoinJar exchange has an excellent fee structure, with costs as low as 0.02% per trade. However, the exchange may struggle with liquidity for high-volume traders compared to international alternatives.    CoinJar prides itself on being a streamlined, easily accessiblecrypto exchange. This means it has done away with many features seen in modern trading platforms. With that said, there is still plenty for investors of all skill levels:         Independent Reserve is a long-standing exchange that has cemented itself in the Australian crypto industry. Independent Reserve was founded in 2013 by Adam Tepper and Adrian Przelozny as part of the first-wave of Australian crypto platforms. The exchange only supports a handful of digital currencies, but balances this with strong customer support and advanced trading options.              0.2-0.5% Bank transfer: Free for deposits of $100$0.99 charge for deposits under $100Debit and credit cards: $0PayPal: $0 Bank transfer: $0PayID/Osko/Instant withdrawal: $1.50 30 Sydney 4    Independent Reserve is a clean, modern crypto trading platform ideal for higher-net-worth or institutional investors. The platform caters heavily to those who trade professionally or frequently. For example, the base trading fee (0.5%) can be reduced to 0.02% for accounts that trade more than 200 million AUD monthly. The lack of cryptocurrencies available may be off-putting to more speculative investors, but the kind of customer Independent Reserve attracts likely only wants to trade a select few digital assets anyway. Advanced traders will also enjoy the multitude of deposit options, leveraged trading (up to 2x) and Independent Reserve’s integration with the KPMG tax estimator.    The Independent Reserve platform offers a modern, cutting-edge trading interface without the clutter found when using some competitors. There’s admittedly less on Independent Reserve for the casual investor. Still, businesses, institutions and high-net-worth individuals should enjoy the advantages offered by the long-running Australian exchange.          Opening a crypto exchange account for the first time can be a little intimidating. However, most modern platforms have straightforward sign-up processes that take less than ten minutes to complete. The most difficult element of registering on a crypto exchange is verifying the new account, which requires government-issued identification like a passport or driver’s license. To assist newcomers, here is a step-by-step guide to opening an exchange account using Swyftx as an example: First, head to the exchange homepage being used. Most landing sites will make it extremely easy to begin the registration process – select “Sign up”, “Create an Account” or any other prompt given by the platform. On Swyftx, we can click “Signup” or “Start Trading”. Next, we must enter relevant details to create an exchange account. This typically includes email, country of residence, full name and a mobile number. Fill in the form accurately and move on to the next step. Ensure you have access to the quoted mobile and email address, as most platforms require these contact methods to be verified. Verify the mobile number and email address entered using a unique six-digit code. Finally, create a secure password to keep the account safe. Some platforms (such as Swyftx) will require passwords to contain unique characters like numbers, capital letters and so on. Select “Create” and that’s it – the account is ready to rock and roll. Although we now have an account that can browse our exchange of choice, we must still pass KYC protocols before depositing AUD and trading. Most platforms will automatically prompt new users to complete verification. If not, the process can be started via “Account Settings” or a similar tab. To get started, new accounts need a form of government-issued identification. They may also need to take a selfie or sometimes even record a short video. Completing this process via a smartphone is much easier than a desktop browser. Follow the on-screen instructions and submit all required images and videos. Most exchanges automatically verify new users, so the account should be ready to trade within five minutes if everything checks out. In some circumstances, the new account must undergo manual verification. This can take 24-72 hours, so some patience is required. Either way, users can deposit AUD and begin trading their favourite cryptocurrencies once the account is fully verified.  Perhaps the hardest part of starting the crypto investment journey is choosing a crypto exchange that suits your needs. While the platforms noted on this list are all excellent options, what might work for one investor might be a poor choice for another. That’s why several factors are worth considering before choosing a crypto exchange.  Australians should always consider using an Australian-based exchange – at least while starting out. There are many advantages to using a local exchange. For starters, they must abide by Australian financial regulations. Australian businesses also offer more relevant deposit options (PayID/Osko, for example), operate in the same timezone and tend to have locally-based customer support.  On the other hand, more experienced traders may want to actually consider an exchange outside of Australia. This is because the nation is a relatively small market, and higher net-worth orders may suffer from poor liquidity and high spreads. Additionally, overseas platforms typically have better support for derivatives and margin trading.   A crypto exchange’s reputation is extremely important. A good resource to use is Trustpilot or Productreview, where independent customers give a rating out of five to various businesses and their associated customer support. New investors should also look at the customer service options available. Exchanges that offer 24/7 support, live chat or a mobile hotline are often preferable to those lacking these options.  These reviews give insight into the most trusted crypto exchanges in Australia.   Hacks and exchange attacks are slowly becoming a thing of the past for the crypto industry, but they are still a real threat for now. Australian exchanges are often innately more secure than international exchanges due to their lower turnover – making them less of a target. Other security metrics to consider include:       Beginner investors likely only need a few cryptocurrencies to start building their portfolios. Nearly every major exchange supports a wide enough range to get their customers started. However, experienced traders interested in more obscure altcoins should always double-check each platform’s listed coins. For example, it wouldn’t make much sense for an investor who wants to purchase ApeCoin to sign up for an exchange that doesn’t offer it.  Platforms that do not accept AUD can pose a major inconvenience to investors – especially newcomers to the crypto scene. These exchanges should be avoided by those who want to take a backseat on their investment voyage.  Additionally, certain platforms may offer unique and appealing payment options. An exchange that allows investors to buy crypto with debit/credit card, PayPal or cash could be an advantage over a competitor that only supports bank transfers.  Fees are rightfully one of an investor’s biggest considerations before selecting a crypto exchange. For some traders, a fee difference of just 0.01% can be the difference between turning a profit and making a loss. While most platforms are fairly transparent with their trading fees, investors should always investigate spreads – the difference between an asset’s buy and sell price. These “hidden fees” can easily make a seemingly cost-effective exchange rather expensive. Crypto regulation still sits in a grey area, but there are still important government protocols for exchanges to follow. Most of these rules act in the consumer’s best interest, so it’s a good idea for beginners to stick to exchanges registered with their local financial authority. For Australian operating platforms, this is AUSTRAC. There are several high-quality exchanges in Australia for crypto enthusiasts to choose from. The “best exchange” will be one that suits each investor’s personal financial goals. Swyftx, CoinSpot, Independent Reserve and CoinJar are all solid options. Very few Australian exchanges have encountered major issues with liquidity or security. However, only three have acquired ISO27001 Certification, the industry standard for information security – Swyftx, CoinSpot and Independent Reserve. Swyftx has the highest Trustpilot score of Australian exchanges, with an excellent rating of 4.7/5. Other high-scoring local trading platforms include CoinSpot (4.4), CoinJar (4.1) and Coinstash (4.5). International heavy-hitters Binance and Bybit have some of the lowest fees on the market. High-volume traders can see fees as low as 0.075%. For Australian exchanges, Swyftx reportedly has the lowest spreads, while Independent Reserve and Coinjar offer the lowest fees for institutional investors. Performing due diligence on an exchange and the development team behind the company is a great way to ensure the exchange is trustworthy. However, the only way to truly avoid counterparty risk is to eliminate it altogether. Long-term investors should consider moving at least some of their crypto assets off an exchange and into a non-custodial wallet.

    "news_title": "7 Best Crypto Debit Cards in Australia",
    "news_content": "This guide lists some crypto debit cards available in Australia that provide an avenue to spend your Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. They work just like a normal debit card at any place that accepts your card such as retail EFTPOS machines, ATMs and online shopping. Stablesis an Australian-based crypto debit card focused on everyday spending. The team partnered up with payment provider Mastercard to offer Aussies a card that works at almost every major retailer – brick & mortar or via the internet. The key concept of Stables is that the card is powered by stablecoins, so those using it don’t need to worry about volatility associated with crypto assets. Stablecoins are pegged to the price of fiat currencies like the US dollar, so their volatility is often lower. This allows the Stables card to be used internationally with no foreign exchange fees (although spending fees and some conditions apply). There are no fees for receiving, storing or spending USDC via the app. Some fees apply when spending stablecoins with their card. When buying and selling USDC, USDT, for fiat,check the conversion rate in-app. For a breakdown of the stables fees visit our dedicatedStables summary. Stables Features: Check out the Stables website for a signup offer.  Coinjaris a popularcrypto exchange in Australiathat offers customers a cryptocurrency debit card powered by Mastercard. This lets you spend your digital currencies just like cash – whether you want to withdraw cash from an ATM, go on an online shopping spree, or simply pay via card at the counter of your favourite store. The Coinjar Mastercard debit card can even be linked to Apple and Google Pay, so you don’t need the physical Coinjar product with you to take advantage of it. With conversion and withdrawal fees of 1%, the Coinjar card provides an avenue to spend your crypto just like fiat currency. The system comes with arewards accountwhere points can be redeemed for products and services like free trades. Check out what other features the exchange offers in ourCoinjar review. Features: Crypto.com Visa Card is probably the most well-known cryptocurrency debit card in the industry, thanks to its widespread brand awareness of Crypto.com. It is a prepaid, high-end metal card with no annual fees or monthly fees, up to 5% cashback on all spending among other benefits like airport lounge access and free Spotify subscriptions. The card relies on theCrypto.comnative token, CRO, which can be staked on the exchange platform for higher debit card rewards. It’s worth noting that the upper echelon of crypto rewards typically requires $400,000+ worth of CRO staked, which might be out of reach for most average investors. Features: Wirex claims to be the “first company in the world to develop…a crypto-enabled debit card” and has quickly climbed the ranks thanks to its features and versatility. The team partnered up with Novatti in March 2023 to begin offering its services to Australian customers. Aussie crypto investors can spend their digital assets with up to 8% cashback, no monthly fees and store over 130 cryptocurrencies. Features: The Bitpay card is currently unavailable to Australian customers, however, the team is working on offering the product globally in the coming years. The Bitpay Debit Card is another Mastercard-powered offering that works at essentially every shop you’d need it to – whether that’s online, offline or somewhere in-between. The company has been around for quite a while (since 2011) and has built a reputation for strong products and strong customer support in that time. A particularly unique feature of the Bitpay Debit Card is that it can be linked with a non-custodial wallet to securely spend digital currencies. Most alternatives require crypto to be stored natively inside the spending app or an associated exchange. Features: Binance has recently encountered an issue with its services to Australian residents – and its Visa Card is currently unavailable to Aussies. Binance is the world’s largestcryptocurrency exchangeand is renowned for offering a massive range of features. One such feature is its Visa debit Card, which works at 60+ million merchants worldwide. The card works simply – customers can just transfer crypto assets from their Binance spot trading wallet to their card wallet, and they’re ready to go. Spending is also rewarded with a daily cashback, paid out in BNB. Binance have even worked on their own payment gateway, Binance Pay, to help facilitate conversion of crypto to fiat currency and vice versa when spending digital assets. Related:Binance Australia Review Features: The Cryptopay Visa Debit Cardcan help investors spend their cryptocurrencies anywhere and anytime. Thanks to the card’s integration with Visa, the Cryptopay Visa card can be used at essentially any retailer, as Visa is one of the world’s largest payment providers. The pre-paid card also has high spending limits, security measures and a smartphone application.The physical card can only be accessed by residents of the United Kingdom, however, there are plans in place to expand the customer base globally. Features: Crypto debit cards allow investors to spend their crypto balance just like they would regular cash. Most card use a payment gateway like Visa or Mastercard meaning they can be used at whatever merchants accept those types of cards. That includes brick-and-mortar stores, online shops, ATMs and so on. Most crypto debit cards must be linked to a wallet containing with digital assets. Often, these wallets will be offered by the underlying card provider – for example, Binance Debit Card users must fund their Binance wallets for the card to work. However, a select few cards can be linked with multiple non-custodial wallets, giving extra flexibility to investors. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has specific rules around cryptocurrency and tax that differ from most other nations. Therefore it’s important to read any guidelines and consult a taxation expert (if necessary) to understand your crypto taxation requirements. Using a crypto debit card to buy products at a store, or to withdraw cash at an ATM, will typically result in a tax obligation. This is because investors are “selling” their crypto for fiat whenever they use the debit card – otherwise known as a disposal event. If the crypto was valued higher upon its disposal than when it was first purchased, this is a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) event and an investor must pay tax on their profits. However, there are some exceptions, which is why it’s important to discuss your unique financial situation with a financial advisor or accountant.

    "news_title": "Best Crypto Education Platform in Australia",
    "news_content": "  After analysing several platforms,we believe that Empire Crypto Trading is the best crypto educational platform for Australians. The user-friendly website provides a huge list of course-based content, perfect for beginners just getting their feet wet or experts looking to hone their trading strategies. Best of all, Empire provides personalised advice for each member – through one-on-one calls with a coach, live weekly zoom meetings and more.  Learning about cryptocurrency is the first step for all investors, no matter their background. Whether you want to understand how a blockchain works, analyse a project’s token supply or start making advanced trades based on technical analysis, there’s a crypto education platform for you. But with so many options out there, the question remains – which is the best? Empire Crypto Trading is an Australian-based business offering a range of educational content for people of all skill levels. The platform was born out of a Facebook group, which is still active and boasts over 2.4K members. The strength of Empire is its community – and the essence of these social elements has transferred over to the main website. You can view the FREE feedhere. Empire Crypto Trading users can access an array of in-depth courses, from covering the basics of blockchain tech to using advanced indicators. In particular, Premium users will find hours of content on technical analysis that can take their trading game to the next level. Empire also offers live one-on-one calls with their coaches, alongside frequent market updates and research articles. Investified is a Melbourne-based educational platform geared toward investors interested in any market – including cryptocurrency. The team, headed by experienced founders Anthony,  Zac and Richard delivers actionable investment knowledge in the form of market insights, market reports and hours of academy content. The platform is renowned for its education-meets-social media foundation and sports an attractive Activity Feed that will keep you up to date on all the latest news and investment ideas. One of the key features is the risk/reward analysis that Investified perform on a select number of digital currencies, arming prospective investors with all the info they need before spending a cent. Collective Shift is an Australian-based crypto research platform founded in 2020 by Tasmanian Ben Simpson. The educational platform is brimming with content, including daily insights from world-class analysts, monthly altcoin reports and market predictions based on hours of research. New users are welcome to a free 15-minute strategy session with an expert from Collective Shift to outline their investment goals and walk through the company’s ten-step framework. Premium members get access to a customisable research feed that populates with user-specific videos, blog posts and other information. The Collective Shift platform thrives on its massive collection of resource materials, making it a terrific option for investors who need quick but comprehensive breakdowns of digital assets, particularly more obscure altcoins. There are research reports and bullish/bearing ratings available for many tokens, with more on the way. It can be a good idea for Australian customers to stay local – as customer support times, tax guidelines and fiat currencies all line up. With that said, there are several international crypto educational platforms that have a history of successful clients and an excellent reputation in the industry. Real Vision frames itself as a community driven by the world’s brightest, most diverse economic minds put together in one place. The platform’s goal is to make everyone become smarter, more successful investors by teaching them how to understand the global economy through real-time analysis, documentaries, research reports and more. New videos are added every day, giving clients the most up-to-date knowledge available. The company provides several membership tiers, making it suitable for investors of all financial and experience levels. Beginners can stick with the basic level to unlock useful tutorials, access to community Q+As and an archive filled with hundreds of articles. Active traders or higher-volume investors may want to consider the Pro Crypto tier, which gives them access to a weekly technical analysis show, masterclasses from experienced investors and more. The driving force behind a crypto educational platform is the quality of its content. Most top-tier services offer an array of in-depth research on market trends, as well as individual digital assets. Ensuring these reports (whether videos, articles or even books) are well-edited, use up-to-date references and are easy to understand is a good way to quickly gauge the content’s quality. Investors should look for platforms that cover a broad range of content, ranging from fundamental analysis of the crypto market, how to read charting software and how to form an individualised investment strategy. Some crypto platforms are a nightmare to traverse, especially those with an overwhelming amount of resources to pick between. Sticking to an educational website with a user-friendly interface will make your life a lot easier, while keeping you motivated to keep learning and improving as an investor. Having access to experts who have “been there, done that” is one of the most valuable things an educational platform can provide. The personalised touch can be the difference between watching a couple of videos online versus receiving a comprehensive education. Not all platforms provide this access – so keep an eye out for crypto educational services with expert calls, Q+As or other forms of direct feedback. A platform’s social media presence can be a window into the strength of its community and the quality of its content without having to pay a cent. Most crypto education services will run a Facebook or Instagram page that will tease some of its articles, while engaging its community. Some will even have a members-only social media presence – think a Facebook group or Discord server – where you can participate in discussions and learn from other like-minded individuals. Presented by Empire Crypto Trading Ben Knight is a writer and editor from Melbourne with a passion for all things music and finance. He enjoys turning complex topics – especially the technical details of cryptocurrency – into digestible bites that anybody can understand. He acquired his Master’s in Writing, Editing and Publishing from RMIT in 2019 and has run his own creative writing business ever since.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Price (AUD) | Price, Chart, About & News",
    "news_content": "Options: * Price updated within the last 10 minutes Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It was the first decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it operates without a central authority like a bank or government. Bitcoin runs on a public ledger called the blockchain, which records all transactions in a peer-to-peer network. Users connect to the network with Bitcoin wallet software, and transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in the blockchain. This allows two users to transact directly without needing a third-party intermediary. Bitcoin was created to be an alternative to traditional fiat currencies and was intended to give users financial freedom and anonymity. It has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which ensures scarcity similar to precious metals. Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency today, though many others have been created using its source code and basic framework. In January 2009, Nakamoto mined the genesis block, launching the Bitcoin network and the world’s first cryptocurrency. In the early days, bitcoins were mainly obtained through mining and had very little real-world value. In 2010, some key milestones occurred that showed Bitcoin’s potential as a medium of exchange. Programmer Laszlo Hanyecz conducted the first known commercial Bitcoin transaction, trading 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas on May 22. Later that year Bitcoin started actively trading, reaching parity with the US dollar. While Nakamoto was the original inventor, he handed control of the Bitcoin code to developer Gavin Andresen. Since then, hundreds of developers have contributed to improving Bitcoin’s software and helping scale the network. Though the identity of Bitcoin’s founder remains a mystery, a community of developers stewards the project today. Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market. It has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade, and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives. The entire cryptocurrency market — now worth more than $2 trillion — is based on the idea realized by Bitcoin: money that can be sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world, without reliance on trusted intermediaries, such as banks and financial services companies. Thanks to its pioneering nature, BTC remains at the top of this energetic market after over a decade of existence. Even after Bitcoin has lost its undisputed dominance, it remains the largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization that surpassed the $1 trillion mark in 2021, after the Bitcoin price AUD hit an all-time high of over $100,000 AUD on April 14, 2021. This is owing in large part to growing institutional interest in Bitcoin and the ubiquitousness of platforms that provide use-cases for BTC price checking and trading: wallets, exchanges, payment services, online games, and more. You can view a list ofcrypto prices in AUD. The Bitcoin price AUD is always fluctuating, as Bitcoin is traded globally 24/7. From humble beginnings of less than 1 cent per BTC, the cryptocurrency has seen huge growth, gaining thousands of percent in value to reach the current Bitcoin price. Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, the BTC price can change frequently. So, the Bitcoin price AUD you see one minute could be different the next. Additionally, Bitcoin price differences can exist when looking across various exchanges and countries. So, the amount of Australian dollars (AUD) needed to buy Bitcoin can vary depending on where you are located and the exchange you use. The Bitcoin price AUD is never static but constantly adjusting based on trading activity worldwide. Every four years an event called theBitcoin halvingoccurs, which halves the rewards paid to Bitcoin miners. This is typically followed by a surge in price, leading to a crypto bull market.

    "news_title": "XRP Price (AUD) | Ripple News, Chart & About",
    "news_content": "Options: * Price updated within the last 10 minutes Launched in 2021, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is an open-source, permissionless, and decentralized technology. Benefits of the XRP Ledger include its low cost ($0.0002 to transact), speed (settling transactions in 3-5 seconds), scalability (1,500 transactions per second), and inherently green attributes (carbon-neutral and energy-efficient). The XRP Ledger also features the first decentralized exchange (DEX) and custom tokenization capabilities built into the protocol. Since 2012, the XRP Ledger has been operating reliably, having closed 70 million ledgers. Since late 2020, Ripple Labs has been engaged in a legal battle with the SEC over whether XRP is an unregistered security. The SEC argues that XRP meets the criteria of a security based on the Howey Test. However, Ripple contends that XRP is a currency, not a security, and should not require registration. The outcome of this high-profile lawsuit could have major implications on crypto regulations in the US. If Ripple wins, it may weaken the SEC’s authority over cryptocurrencies. But if the SEC prevails, it could force many crypto assets to register as securities and adhere to stricter rules. The lawsuit remains ongoing with no definite resolution yet reached. In 2012, David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto launched the XRP Ledger with its native currency, XRP, as a faster, more energy-efficient alternative to the Bitcoin blockchain. Along with Chris Larsen, they founded the company Ripple. The XRP Ledger presents a wide variety of applications and use cases related to payments, including micropayments, DeFi, and, soon, NFTs. Deployed in 2012, the XRPL supports enterprises and developers with powerful utility and flexibility. Developers can access tutorials on the XRP website to help build solutions that solve inefficiencies, including remittance and asset tokenization. Currently, the main applications of the XRP Ledger are payments, tokenization, DeFi, CBDCs, and stablecoins. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, the XRP Ledger uses a unique Federated Consensus mechanism as its method of validating transactions. This allows the network to process transactions extremely quickly without relying on energy-intensive mining. With Federated Consensus, transactions are confirmed through agreement between independent servers called validators. These validators continuously communicate with each other to determine the order and validity of XRP transactions. The Ripple price AUD fluctuates frequently based on supply and demand. As of October 2023, the XRP price AUD is around $0.77 AUD per XRP token. This can change rapidly based on market conditions. The total circulating supply of XRP is over 99 billion tokens, making it one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, unlike Bitcoin, the majority of the XRP supply is still held by the company Ripple. Crypto News Australia provides you with the most relevant Bitcoin, cryptocurrency & blockchain news.

    "news_content": "Options: * Price updated within the last 10 minutes Ethereum provides a decentralised virtual machine that enables the creation and deployment of decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs stored on the Ethereum blockchain that run automatically when predetermined conditions are met. The Ethereum blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism called proof-of-work, where miners compete to add new blocks to the chain. Ethereum is transitioning to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake system called The Merge, which went live in September 2022. Ethereum has undergone several planned network upgrades since its launch to improve functionality and prepare for the shift to proof-of-stake. In 2022, the Arrow Glacier update delayed The Merge to June 2022. Ethereum also decided to rebrand its terminology, dropping “Ethereum 2.0” for more accurate terms like the “consensus layer” and “execution layer.” The Merge went live on September 15, 2022, transitioning Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. This reduced Ethereum’s energy usage by ~99.9% while still retaining its functionality. The Shanghai Upgrade, which happened in March 2023, enabled stakers to unstake and withdraw staked ETH and rewards. This unlocked over 17.5 million ETH currently staked on the network. Hence, the Ethereum price AUD changed accordingly. The idea for Ethereum was first proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine. Buterin envisioned Ethereum as a blockchain-based computing platform that would go beyond the financial applications allowed by Bitcoin to also support more advanced applications like smart contracts. In 2014, Buterin formally announced Ethereum at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami and launched a crowd sale to help fund its development. The crowdsale attracted the interest of fellow programmers, including British developer Gavin Wood and Swiss developer Jeffrey Wilcke. Together with six other co-founders, including Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio, and Mihai Alisie, Buterin launched the Swiss non-profit Ethereum Foundation to continue research and development. Ethereum underwent a crowdsale in July and August 2014, raising over $18 million in Bitcoin. Related:Bitcoin price (AUD) Ethereum utilises blockchain technology to allow a network of computers to agree on the execution of code without the need for a central authority. This enables users to create censorship-resistant decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. The native currency of the Ethereum blockchain is called Ether (ETH). ETH is required to execute smart contracts on the Ethereum network and serves as a means to transact value between users. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum uses a proof-of-work consensus algorithm to secure the network and validate transactions. Miners compete to solve computational puzzles in order to create new blocks and are rewarded with ETH for each successful block created. Ethereum (ETH) is the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin in terms of market capitalisation. The Ethereum price AUD provides insight into how much 1 ETH is worth in Australian dollars. As it stands, ETH reached its all-time high in November 2021 at a price of $6,100. View allCrypto to AUD prices.

    "news_title": "Dogecoin Price (AUD) | Price, Chart, About & News",
    "news_content": "Options: * Price updated within the last 10 minutes Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was created in 2013 as a joke based on the “Doge” internet meme of a Shiba Inu dog. It uses a decentralized, peer-to-peer network and open-source blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin and Litecoin. However, it has some technical differences in terms of mining and transaction processing. The Dogecoin logo features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the popular meme. The name Dogecoin also references the doge meme. UnlikeBitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin has a high supply of coins and low value per coin. There is no cap on the total supply of Dogecoins. Dogecoin originally had a block time of 1 minute and transaction fees of almost zero. This allowed for faster transactions compared to other cryptocurrencies. No discussion of Dogecoin is complete without mentioning Elon Musk. The Tesla/SpaceX CEO has been a staunch supporter of Dogecoin on social media since early 2021. His tweets have catalyzed epic DOGE rallies and crashes. Though his passion has waned at times, he still holds influence over the DOGE price action. Dogecoin was created in December 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. They forked the code from Litecoin to create a new digital currency that was based on the popular Doge meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. Their goal was to make a fun cryptocurrency that would have a wider appeal beyond just tech enthusiasts like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work protocol, Dogecoin uses Scrypt technology and has a block time of 1 minute. The supply of Dogecoin is also uncapped, meaning there is no limit to how many can be mined. The quick block time and unlimited supply makes Dogecoin more accessible for miners. Another key difference is Dogecoin has been used primarily as a tipping system on social media to reward the creation and sharing of quality content. The lighthearted nature of the meme-inspired currency sets it apart from other cryptos. The DOGE price in AUD fluctuates frequently, having reached over $0.70 at its peak. As a highly volatile asset, the Dogecoin price can change significantly on any given day based on market forces and hype driven by influencers like Elon Musk. The lack of a supply cap makes it difficult to predict future price appreciation. But the enduring popularity of the Doge meme and Elon Musk’s promotion of it suggests continued demand.

    "news_title": "SOL Price (AUD) | Price, Chart, About & News",
    "news_content": "Options: * Price updated within the last 10 minutes Solana is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency that is designed to be highly scalable, secure and decentralized.  It uses a unique “proof of history” consensus mechanism that combines proof of stake and proof of elapsed time. This allows it to process transactions very quickly – theoretically up to 700,000 per second. Solana has very low fees compared to other major blockchains likeEthereum (ETH). Transactions cost a fraction of a cent on Solana. The native cryptocurrency of the platform is also called Solana (SOL). This is used to pay for transactions, staking and governance on the blockchain. Solana aims to be a high-performance blockchain that can support decentralized applications at scale, including DeFi, NFTs, Web3 apps and more. It has seen very rapid growth and adoption since launching. Hence, the Solana price AUD also fluctuates. As of October 2023, it is one of the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, Solana has faced some criticism regarding its level of decentralization due to its architecture being optimized for speed and scalability. Solana was founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former Qualcomm senior staff engineer manager. Yakovenko had also worked as a software engineer at Dropbox before starting Solana. He was joined by his Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald in founding Solana Labs to develop the Solana blockchain protocol. Additional former Qualcomm engineers also joined the Solana Labs team, bringing their experience in high-performance computing and wireless technology to help build Solana into a leading high-speed blockchain platform. Under Yakovenko’s leadership as CEO, Solana has become one of the top market-cap blockchain projects of high SOL price within just a few years of its public launch. One of Solana’s most important innovations is its proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism. This allows Solana to process transactions and execute smart contracts at lightning speeds that are significantly faster than other major blockchains. The protocol was designed to keep Solana price low despite massive scalability. Since launching in 2020, Solana has rapidly risen to become a top 10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, buoyed by developer activity, DeFi and NFT usage, and the SOL token’s 700% price gain from mid-2021 to September 2021. Solana reached an all-time high of $216 in September 2021. While praised for its speed, Solana has suffered setbacks from repeated outages that have hampered reliability. Critics also accuse its tokenomics as favouring venture investors over the community. However, with its strong technical foundations and rapid growth, Solana continues to be considered a leading contender that can potentially rival Ethereum.

    "news_content": "Bitcoin continues to press higher towards a new all-time high. It currently trades up 14% for the month of October. Fear and greedcurrently reads 77 – Greed. Last week was a big one for US Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) as demand resulted in $ 0.9 billion USD in net buying across all products, compared to a staggering$2.1 billion USD in net buyingthe week prior. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETFrecorded$875 million of inflows on Oct. 30, surpassing its previous record by around 3%. MicroStrategy hasannounceda $42 billion USD capital plan for the next three years centred around its Bitcoin strategy. Dubbed the “21/21” plan, it seeks to raise $21 billion from equity raises and the remaining $21 billion from debt offerings. Tonight, the Bank of Japan willannouncetheir latest update to their interest rates, the forecast is for <0.25%.  Back in March, Japan increased their interest rates to 0.1% and again in July to 0.25%. This resulted in volatility across broader markets as it deviated from the -.1% policy rate, which had been steady for over a decade prior. On Friday, we haveInflation and Employmentdata being released out of the US at 10:30 pm AEST. Results outside of expectations could drive volatility as they may not be priced in or expected by the market.

Below are two possible outcomes from here. I’m waiting to see if the previous lows, in the grey box, hold out as support in the coming days; if so, we could see this as a foundation for the market to push towards a new all-time high figure. If I see a deceleration from market buyers, we could start to see prices retest lower.

Below are my thoughts on what could come next, when mapping out price using Fibonnaci analysis. If the market holds nicely across the board, I’m looking at the next key Fibonacci level of $0.19723. Sluggish action from the bulls could see prices slide, and retest support around the range midpoint of $0.15493 I’ve liked the market structure ofPYTHsince September. It’s showing me signs of dips being bought and new higher highs and lows forming. This suggests to me the market is happy to start paying higher prices so far. Below are my two takeaways on what I’m waiting to see next. I am eyeing the price to continue moving towards the next Fib levels and continue to push higher towards the mid-range at $0.6899 and the ‘Golden Fibonacci’ level at $0.8009. Any signs of weakness or directional change in direction could result in new lows to still form. Keep up to date. Stay informed and connected!

    "news_title": "Ethereum Sci-Fi Game Serves as Blueprint for Roland Emmerich’s ‘Space Nation’ TV Show",
    "news_content": "A new sci-fi TV series based on anEthereummassively multiplayer online (MMO) game is under development, potentially taking the blockchain community to places no degen has gone before! According toDecrypt, the series will be based on the recently launched Ethereum game Space Nation Online. Roland Emmerich (also known as ‘The Master of Disaster’) will act as executive producer — he’s the director of such classic sci-fi works asIndependence DayandThe Day After Tomorrow. hey@rolandemmerich, what you working on apart from the Space Nation TV series? The series will essentially be a prequel to the game, with the plot of the series ending where the game takes off, potentially increasing interest in the game and blockchain tech generally. Related:Vitalik Buterin Reveals Next Stages for Ethereum in Effort to Streamline and Simplify the Protocol Emmerich said the series would be eight episodes long and focus on the story of a girl who wants to stay on Earth to help wage a futile resistance against an invading alien species: It tells the story of a girl who wants to actually stay on Earth and defend Earth from these invaders. Now, the invaders—you don’t know much about them; you only know they’re coming. When they come, they’re a much bigger force than you ever can imagine. According to Emmerich’s co-executive producer Marco Weber, a lot of the tension in the series will revolve around the decision of when to give up the fight and flee Earth: It’s a little bit of a Noah’s Ark concept with a ticking clock. They know there is an attack coming from the aliens, and when they need to basically decide to stay on Earth and defend or all board Noah’s Ark. That’s the conflict. In the end, the Earth and in fact the entire solar system are destroyed, leaving the characters in the situation we find them in the game, roaming space in spaceships — reminiscent ofBattlestar Galactica. Development is still in the very early stages, Emmerich says the team hopes to have scripts developed by the end of next year with production taking another year or so, with an air date of some time in 2027. The game Space Nation Online soft-launched in September, with a broader release expected by the end of the year — it’s built on the Ethereum layer 2 network,ImmutablezKEVM. In the game the player must re-establish human civilization after the entire solar system has been destroyed by the invading aliens. Emmerich says he’d consider doing multiple seasons of the show if it proves popular and is considering ending the first season on a cliffhanger, allowing for the possibility of a second season set before the events in the game. It wouldn’t feel right if the first big crypto-adjacent TV series was made by a crypto-sceptic, so it’s nice to know that Emmerich is himself a big HODLer ofBitcoin: I kind of own a lot ofBitcoin. I watch it grow, I’m more the‘HODL’guy. I never get nervous when it crashes, at the same point, because I know this is a long-term thing. Both Emmerich and Weber will also receive large amounts of the token associated with the Space Nation Online game, OIK token. However, Weber says they’ve got long lock-up periods, with no plans to pump and dump on other holders: As founders, and all the team members, we’ve given ourselves very long and conservative cliffs, so there’s no pump-and-dump scheme. Related:Star Trek Fans Push Back Against ‘Tone Deaf’ NFT Launch There’s also plans for NFT collections associated with the game, the first of which was designed by Emmerich and is set to drop November 10. If successful, there may be new NFT collections released annually. Jody is a Brisbane-based freelance writer who specialises in writing about business, technology, and the future of work.

    "news_title": "Fortune Report Alleges Widespread Wash Trading on Polymarket",
    "news_content": "Polymarket was mostly unknown in the crypto mainstream until a few months ago, but has become popular due to the US presidential election. The online betting site, which claims to be the world’s largest prediction market, lets the user bet on all sorts of peculiar things, like whether a category 5 hurricane will hit the US before the election (currently a 1% chance) or whether the US will confirm the existence of aliens before the year 2024 ends (3% chance). Related:Bitcoin Could Hit $200K by Tapping Into Gold’s Market, Says Bitwise’s Hougan But the race betweenDonald TrumpandKamala Harristo win the White House is probably the most talked-about bet on the platform. Polymarket reports the election has attracted around US$2.7 billion (AU$4.1 billion) in bets. However, it seems that not all the betting is just fun and games; some of these bets, or rather the money flows behind them, seem more nefarious. According to areportbyFortune, two blockchain firms have investigated activities at Polymarket and allege widespread wash trading on the platform. One of the firms cited by Fortune, Chaos Labs, claims “wash trading constituted around one-third of trading volume on Polymarket’s presidential market”. The second one, Inca Digital, alleges a “significant portion of the volume” might be due to wash trading. Wash trading involves the simultaneous and repeated buying and/or selling of financial assets such as shares or cryptocurrencies to artificially inflate trade volume and manipulate the market by creating a misleading appearance of increased market activity. The practice is considered illegal and unethical because it misleads investors about the true supply and demand characteristics of the asset or a market. The report comes after claims by some media outlets that thehigh odds of Trump were a sign of market manipulation. However, theFortunearticle suggested that it may actually not be the election that’s driving this but rather the fact that Polymarket might want to launch its own token. The article claims that wash trading is “common across crypto applications, and especially ones with the potential for future token launches and airdrops”.

Interestingly, Harris is in a large lead when it comes to thepopular vote. The Vice President is currently 22% ahead of the former president in the popular vote. Of course, it’s not the popular vote that gets the next president into the White House but rather the Electoral College. So, in the end, it comes down to what matters most in every US election: the swing states. Aaron Feuerstein is a freelance writer based in Melbourne.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Nears $74k Mark, Analysts Predict New All-Time High Amid ‘Rising Bullish Momentum’",
    "news_content": "Bitcoin continues to tease a new all-time high, flying past US$73K several times in the past few days, with its eyes firmly on the US$74K mark. At the time of writingBitcoinis trading for US$72,209 (AU$109,905) as per data from CoinMarketCap. That’s an increase of 7.54% in the past week and 14% in the past month. In an emailed statement, Josh Gilbert, Market Analyst at eToro, toldCNA: Compared to other cycles, retail investor interest doesn’t seem to have reached its peak, despite bitcoin closing in on those record highs. This could be a catalyst to keep driving the price of the crypto asset higher from here. Historically, when bitcoin gains momentum, the upward trend often remains unbroken for weeks or even months. Related:Arthur Hayes Reveals How China Could Help Bitcoin Surge Gilbert believes BTC is moving toward new highs as it appears “within touching distance of the $74,000 record high set back in March”. The analyst is among many who believe the market is now factoring in aDonald Trump winin the US election. Trump is seen as the better alternative for Bitcoin, driving “bullish momentum”. A quiet but steady bullish momentum has been brewing over the past few weeks following months of consolidation, as the asset looks to be pricing in a Donald Trump election win, the clear bitcoin advocate of the two competing candidates. In case you’re wondering whether it’s too late to buy Bitcoin – as it approaches new all-time highs – here’s the founder of SkyBridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci, who believes it’s “still very early”. If you’re watching#Bitcoinmake new highs and thinking you missed the boat – you didn’t. It’s still VERY early, in my opinion. Read the whitepaper, listen and read people like@saylor@real_vijay@ErikVoorhees. This could be due to a real lack of interest from retail investors, who haven’t really come back into the market yet. Additionally, in an interview in August,Scaramucci saidBitcoin hasn’t even reached its status as a store of value yet. The former White House Director of Communications said Bitcoin is still “an early adopting technology”. Related:Bitcoin Could Hit $200K by Tapping Into Gold’s Market, Says Bitwise’s Hougan In his view, the real drive forward for BTC will happen once it has many more applications built on and around it, and importantly, once the “Wall Street Selling Machine” starts to ramp up its efforts. Just imagine tens of thousands of financial advisers explaining to people out there that they need a position of this in their portfolio. Aaron Feuerstein is a freelance writer based in Melbourne.

    "news_title": "MicroStrategy Vows to Secure $42 Billion for Bitcoin Investments, Despite Loss on Impairment",
    "news_content": "Michael Saylor is at it again… This man is either obsessed or has an enviable conviction, as his company,MicroStrategy, announced an ambitious plan to raise US$42B (AU$63.8B) in capital over the next three years to increase its Bitcoin holdings. Related:Bitcoin Could Hit $200K by Tapping Into Gold’s Market, Says Bitwise’s Hougan Known as the “21/21 plan”, this initiative will involve raising US$21B (AU$31.9B) in equity and US$21B through fixed-income securities, according to a statementreleasedby the company on October 30. MicroStrategy announces $42 billion capital plan including $21 billion ATM equity offering and a target of raising $21 billion in fixed-income securities. Join us at 5pm ET as we discuss our quarterly results and#BitcoinTreasury Company plans.$MSTRhttps://t.co/eXYELbN1Dm As a Bitcoin Treasury Company, we plan to use the additional capital to buy more bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset in a manner that will allow us to achieve higher BTC Yield. If fully realised, this capital could translate to the purchase of approximately 578,586 BTC, which represents around 2.7% of Bitcoin’s total supply. This comes despite MicroStrategy posting a third consecutive quarterly loss, largely driven by a US$412M (AU$612M) impairment charge on its US$18B (AU$27B) BTC portfolio. The company reported third-quarter revenue of US$116.1M (AU$176.4M) from its software operations, down 10% from last year and missing analyst expectations of US$122.5M (AU$186.3M). The quarter’s net loss reached US$340M (AU$517M), compared to US$143M (AU$217M) in the same period last year. Despite these financial challenges, MicroStrategy has managed impressive stock performance, outperforming even tech leader Nvidia over the past two years. As Bitcoin’s price approaches its all-time high, MicroStrategy’s shares have surged nearly 300% this year—outpacingBitcoin’sown 70% gain. Related:Arthur Hayes Reveals How China Could Help Bitcoin Surge Since 2020, the company has relied on methods like convertible notes to finance additional Bitcoin purchases, positioning itself as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, MicroStrategy took steps to support its acquisition strategy, completing a US$1.01B (AU$1.54B) offering of convertible senior notes in September. Due in 2028 and carrying a 0.625% interest rate, these notes were aimed at institutional investors and allow for conversion to cash or MicroStrategy stock. Funds from this offering are also being directed toward Bitcoin purchases. José is a journalist and translator with a keen interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

    "news_content": "The rapid growth of stablecoins has raised concerns within the US Treasury Department, which now suggests moving away from private stablecoins to a state-controlled digital currency, or central bank digital currency (CBDC), something I’m sure they would absolutely love for the sake of transparency, am I right? In areportfrom the Treasury’s Office of Debt Management, the department draws parallels between today’s stablecoins and the privately issued “wildcat” currencies of the 19th century, hinting at the potential for government-issued digital currencies to take their place. The US Treasury breadcrumbs of Stablecoin regulation\"Growth in stablecoins has resulted in a modest increase in demand for short-dated Treasuries\"\"Tokenization might create additional access to Treasuries from both domestic and global pools of savings, particularly from…https://t.co/pX6nqGGka5pic.twitter.com/3XOfcIcQNk Related:Bitcoin Could Hit $200K by Tapping Into Gold’s Market, Says Bitwise’s Hougan Stablecoins, pegged to assets like the US dollar, are critical tools in the cryptocurrency market as they allow seamless and efficient transactions and a way of readjusting portfolios when things go south in the crypto market. However, stablecoin issuers likeTetherand Circle have increasingly integrated with traditional finance, buying an estimated US$120B (AU$182.5B) in US Treasury bills to back their digital assets. Tether alone holds about US$81B (AU$123B) of these Treasury securities, making stablecoins significant players in a traditionally government-centred market. What would happen if crypto’s leading stablecoin fails? A collapse of a major stablecoin like Tether could result in a ‘fire-sale’ of their U.S. Treasuries holdings. While stablecoins currently represent a marginal segment of the T-bills market, growth over time may expose the T-bills market to increased risk of fire sales due to runs in the stablecoin market. Related:Consumer Watchdog Flags Tether for Lack of Transparency in US Dollar Reserves Audit Similarly, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has alsowarnedabout the risks associated with the growing trend oftokenisation in traditional finance. They argue tokenisation might offer benefits such as reduced costs and efficient transactions but represents a significant investment and coordination effort by companies, let alone the fact that the industry might face heavy regulatory challenges. One of the most popular types of tokenised debt, T-bills, could bring “operational improvements and innovation” to the Treasury market. According to the minutes from the US Treasury, one committee member noted that as stablecoins increasingly use T-bills or Treasury-backed repurchase agreements as collateral, their growth has spurred a moderate rise in demand for short-term Treasury securities. However, the use of t-bills would also require careful management to prevent financial instability. One committee member proposed developing a controlled, permissioned blockchain overseen by a trusted government authority to address these concerns.

    "news_title": "Arthur Hayes Reveals How China Could Help Bitcoin Surge",
    "news_content": "Chinese government stimulus spending could be the catalyst to seeBitcoinpump to new heights according to crypto influencer and founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, Arthur Hayes. In his latestblog postHayes argues that the Chinese government’s rumoured plans to launch a AU$2.13 trillion ( US$1.4 trillion) stimulus package could encourage wealthy Chinese investors to flock to Bitcoin as a hedge against monetary debasement — despite official bans on Bitcoin trading in mainlandChina. All the stars are aligned for Beijing to print an insane amount of yuan. What is the antidote for the plebes who will witness a rise in credit creation that isn’t necessarily predicated on a strengthening real economy? Bitcoin加油! Related:China Opens Stimulus Flood Gates Amid Record Demand for Crypto OTC Trades Hayes says that despite the bans, trading of Bitcoin is thriving in mainland China with investors taking advantage of peer-to-peer trading methods offered by major exchanges such as Binance and OKX to work around the restrictions. The BitMEX founder also suggests that the ban on BTC/CNY trading pairs is largely just an attempt by the government to reduce the usefulness of Bitcoin trading as an indicator of Chinese currency devaluation, noting that owning crypto is still legal. Given that the Chinese government knows it cannot ban Bitcoin, and Bitcoin and crypto ownership is not banned in China (contrary to what some misinformed financial media say), Beijing would rather it be out of sight and out of mind. Hayes points to historical data to support his theory that Chinese currency devaluation will boost Bitcoin’s price, highlighting Bitcoin’s almost 5x pump from US$135 to US$600 in 2015 following the devaluation of the yuan. He believes that if the Chinese government goes ahead with its huge stimulus plans, it’s likely the yuan’s value will drop and wealthy Chinese investors will once again flock to Bitcoin as a hedge. No major risky asset class outperforms the debasement of the currency like Bitcoin does. Despite his belief that Chinese investors will pour into Bitcoin, Hayes concedes it could take some time for them to pull the trigger, perhaps waiting until the impact of stimulus spending on the value of the yuan becomes clear. In the meantime, Hayes says investors may initially opt for other investments, such as real estate. Reuters isreportingthat China is considering approving a plan to raise 10 trillion yuan (AU$2.13 trillion) in new debt as early as next week at a meeting of China’s top legislative body, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC). The debt would mostly come in the form of special government bonds, which will be issued over a period of three years. The debt raising amounts to more than 8% of the output of the Chinese economy, which has become increasingly fragile in recent years following a huge, drawn-out property sector crisis and skyrocketing local government debt. Related:Dogecoin Pumps Following Elon Musk’s Appearance at Trump Rally The decision has apparently been planned to coincide with theUSpresidential election, allowing the government some flexibility depending on who wins the election. The stimulus package could potentially be even larger if Trump wins, with fears inside China that his promised tariff plan will harm China’s economy.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin Could Hit $200K by Tapping Into Gold's Market, Says Bitwise's Hougan",
    "news_content": "Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise, believes people commonly get it wrong when they talk about the future of theBitcoinprice. In a recentmemohe wrote about a question he sometimes gets asked: “Does the U.S. dollar need to collapse for bitcoin to hit $200,000?” The simple answer is no, it doesn’t. Most holding Bitcoin would agree that it is a store of value. And in the short few years BTC has been around, it’s come a long way. Hougan says Bitcoin is now being “held by 60% of the world’s largest hedge funds, many of the world’s largest asset managers, and even some countries”. It has survived bulls and bears, scandals and regulatory scrutiny, but most accept it’s “here to stay”. But the CIO says it hasn’t reached maturity yet, citing a lack of media trust and understanding by many people as well as relatively low institutional adoption – although this is slowly changing with the ongoing adoption of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Related:Bitcoin Bracing for ‘Potential Turbulence’ as US Election Day Nears and USDT Depegs So, Hougan argues there is still a lot of room for Bitcoin to grow. Bitcoin could, if it reaches gold’s market cap, be worth around US$900k (AU$1,370k) per coin; but it doesn’t even have to go that high. At $1.3 trillion, bitcoin is 7% of gold’s $18 trillion market cap. I don’t know if a ‘mature bitcoin’ is half gold’s size, equal to gold, or twice as large as it brings in a new demographic. But I’m confident it’s not 7%. Another well-known argument pro Bitcoin, of course, is the relentless money printing by the United States. Itistrue that US debt is out of control, with roughly US$1 trillion (AU$1.52 trillion) being added every 100 days, pushing the total to nearly US$36 trillion (AU$54.8 trillion) and making debt servicing costs unsustainable for the US. According to the US Treasury, this amount has increased over the past 100 years “from $394 B in 1924 to $35.46 T in 2024”. While debt is expected to continue to grow for the time being, Hougan believes this cycle of debt and money printing will lead to a substantial expansion of “the size of the store-of-value market, as investors seek a haven from this insanity”. He added that while it’s hard to predict the size of the store-of-value market, if it triples in the next decade, and Bitcoin just retains its current market share of 7%, well guess what – Bitcoin would also triple. Related:Coinbase Launches ‘Based Agent’ Allowing Users to Build AI-Driven Crypto Agents in Three Minutes But even if the store-of-value market doesn’t grow because debt is under control (gasp!), assuming Bitcoin can increase its market share, it’s still a win. Imagine bitcoin grows to 25% of the current gold market and nothing else happens. No market expansion, no new use cases, no fears of spiraling debt. Great! In that scenario bitcoin would hit $214,000, roughly four times current levels. And if both happen, the market share of BTC goes up and the store-of-value market grows? Well, that’s a win-win for sure, and according to the CIO, “the most likely scenario”. Bitcoin does not need the dollar to collapse to hit $200k. It can get there just by capturing a sliver of gold’s existing market. But as governments continue to abuse their currencies and bitcoin continues to mature, it might just get to that level—and well beyond. At the time of writing Bitcoin is trading for US$72,299 (AU$110,069), trying hard to reach a new all-time high. But if we take anything away from Hougan’s analysis, it’s that the new high will come no matter what – it’s just a question of when… Aaron Feuerstein is a freelance writer based in Melbourne.

    "news_title": "Taking Profits? Bhutan Gov Moves $66 Million BTC to Exchange, Arkham Reports",
    "news_content": "Whale watching has long been one of society’s favourite pastimes. Whether it’s observing a mammal soak up large volumes of krill or cash, onlookers are always left fascinated. But that interest is taken to the next level when the whale isn’t in fact a whale, but a government. The South Asian country, Bhutan, hadbecome one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the worldthroughout 2024. And the government didn’t just stumble across the coins aspart of law enforcement seizures– their ownership was entirely deliberate. At their peak, the Bhutanese Government reportedly held 13,011 BTC – worth approximately AU $1.4b. However, the nation may be gearing up to sell some of its crypto assets, possibly taking profits following Bitcoin’s dream run over the past week. Related:Bitcoin Bracing for ‘Potential Turbulence’ as US Election Day Nears and USDT Depegs According to crypto analytics company Arkham Intelligence, the Royal Government of Bhutan transferred 929 Bitcoins – valued at AU $100m – to Binance earlier today. The motives for Bhutan’s deposit are unclear, however, it’s typically a sign that the government intends to sell a portion of its holdings. The timing is a little strange, considering Bitcoin’s run to a potential new ATH – although perhaps minor profit-taking is the exact reason for Bhutan’s decision. Despite the transfer sending a little shudder down the spine of Bitcoin enthusiasts (remember Germany’s dump earlier this year?), the Royal Government of Bhutan still holds over AU $1b worth of Bitcoin, according to Lookonchain.

But thanks to the nation’s significant source of renewable energy,Bhutan has mined the Bitcoin themselves, instead of relying on busting crooks to fund their reserves.

    "news_title": "Dogecoin Pumps Following Elon Musk’s Appearance at Trump Rally",
    "news_content": "Dogecoin owners might just be barking up the right tree after a week to remember for the world’s biggestmeme coin. DOGE had already been on a tear through the past fortnight – but things were kicked up a notch last night. The affectionately labelled Dogefather,Elon Musk, wasonce again responsible for the coin’s outburst, causing a 12% spike in price over the past 24 hours. Why, you ask? Because, if Trump wins, Musk is going to head his own department – and they’re gonna call it DOGE. Related:SOL Hits Record High Against ETH, Can Memecoin Hype Drive Solana Higher? Elon Musk is one of Dogecoin’s biggest fans. The owner of Tesla and SpaceX has regularly made tweets complimentary of the meme coin, becoming an unofficial ambassador for the project. You caneven buy a luxury Tesla with DOGE. The relationship between Musk and Dogecoin was not lost on the Republican presidential candidateDonald Trump, who introduced Elon at one of his rallies and even promised him a position in government. In what may be a joke but also may not be a joke, Trump publicly announced that Musk would run a department coincidentally called the Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE. Okay, sure. Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. pic.twitter.com/y0UCd5NvMj Regardless of how serious Trump was about his offer to Musk, the crypto market took it seriously. Dogecoin went flying on the news, with investors piling onto the meme coin and bucking the broader altcoin trend. Naturally, ameme coin titled the Department of Governmental Efficiencywas almost immediately minted and has jumped 20% since creation on over US $300k volume (AU $450k). The potential department – if it comes to fruition – will provide constant, governmental exposure to the project, giving it a sense of legitimacy…even if Dogecoin is mostly an homage to a cute, fluffy puppy. With a Trump win a growing possibility (he is edging ahead in certain betting markets), it appears Bitcoin won’t be the only coin set to benefit from a new US president. The addition of Musk to the political fray likely means that Dogecoin could enjoy short-term gains from a Republican victory. Related:Bitcoin ETF Adoption Speeds Ahead: All Major Institutional Types, Including Emory University, Now Invested That said, price boosts based on hype, popularity and let’s be real – memes – aren’t really a sustainable formula. However, proper regulatory reform and providing clarity to Web3 innovatorsisa recipe for success – and this is somethingboth US political parties have promised the crypto community.

Interestingly, Sui has experienced substantial outflows fromEthereumand Solana. In the last 30 days, around US$257M (AU$392M) worth of Ethereum assets have migrated to Sui, while around US$32.2M (AU$49.1M) are from Solana. Meanwhile, SUI, the coin powering the Sui blockchain, is today’s largest gainer. As per data from CoinMarketCap, SUI is up 11.2% in the last 24 hours, currently priced at US$2.10 (AU$3.20). If we zoom out, we see an increase of 22% in the past 30 days and over 350% in one year, making it one of the best-performing assets in the market. The surge comes as the developers behind MemeFi, a popular Telegram-based game, have announced a strategic change in their token launch plans, choosing to migrate from Ethereum’s layer-2 network, Linea, to the Sui blockchain.

    "news_title": "Study Finds 1.5 million Australian Crypto Owners Confused Over Tax Time",
    "news_content": "They say only two things in life are certain: death and taxes, or at least that’s what Benjamin Franklin wrote in a letter to Jean-Baptiste Leroy in 1790. Related:SEC Filing Reveals Microsoft Shareholders to Vote on Investment in Bitcoin Well, as we’re not here to talk about death, we need to talk about another much-disliked topic: taxes. Arecent studyby the University of Queensland (UQ) found that many crypto owners are unsure about how to treat their crypto holdings and many altogether avoid declaring them when it’s tax time. As per the study, 66% of the 745 holders surveyed were aware they had to pay taxes, leaving almost 1.5 million Aussies unclear about their tax obligations, which may lead them to omit crypto from their tax returns altogether. If investors are not aware, they may omit this on their annual tax return and be contacted by the Australian Taxation Office later when discovered. The team of researchers around Associate Professor Levron Blue also found that $171 million was lost tocrypto scamsin 2023 and that education around crypto is crucial – especially about how to avoid scams, store crypto safely and understand tax obligations. Our findings suggest that online financial education from trusted independent sources is urgently needed to help combat scams and to keep Australians and their crypto assets safe. In case you’re interested, Crypto News Australia has some great resources here, including a Crypto Tax Calculator. There’s alsoa guide on the best crypto software in Australiaas well as a guide on9 crypto tax accountants in Australiawho specialise in cryptocurrency tax matters. These resources not only will help reduce stress around tax time but they’re also absolutely free. Apart from taxes, the UQ study also touched on the topic of storing crypto. According to the study, almost 60% of survey respondents reported holding their crypto in a software wallet, with only 16.9% using a hardware wallet. Data from leading Australian-owned tax software providerCrypto Tax Calculatorindicates that the majority of Australian crypto investors have more than one wallet or exchange account, making tax time exponentially more complicated as they try to calculate gains and losses in several places. Interestingly, almost half used centralised exchanges to store their digital assets. Of course, one way to avoid holdingBitcoindirectly is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Although Australians have several options to hold Bitcoin and Ethereum through ETFs, suitable local ETFs for other altcoins are currently limited. Related:Blockchain Breakthroughs: Chainlink Joins Bitcoin as Cardano Integrates $1.3T in BTC Liquidity Which means that aself-managed super fund (SMSF)could be an interesting option for Australians. A SMSF can be a great way to engage with any cryptocurrency, while gaining some interesting tax advantages, and they’re generally not limited to Bitcoin orEthereum. The ATO says thatcurrently $1 billion of crypto is being held in SMSFs. You can read more about that in ourguide here.

    "news_title": "Global X Report: Crypto Pushed Australian ETF Market to New Highs",
    "news_content": "2024 marks the year when the Australian exchange-traded fund (ETF) market reached the $200 billion mark for the first time. Traditionally bond ETFs have dominated the market, but a report by Global X highlights investors’ increased appetite for so-calledrisk oninvestments. The local ETF market now features 394 products and grew by over 48.6% in the past year, reaching $226.6 billion. Related:Trump’s World Liberty Financial Fails to Take Off, Labelled ‘Uninteresting Money Grab’ GlobalX revealed that Australian investors are still favouring low-cost, diversified ETFs, with significant inflows into BetaShares Australia 200 ETF and Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF, each receiving about $2 billion. Interestingly, the report also reveals that –much like their counterparts in the US– crypto funds take the top spot, performance-wise. Global X’s EBTC fund, the 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, grew by 118.1%, making it the top Australian ETF. Betashares’ Crypto Innovators fund made the third spot, growing by 76.7%, just 0.1% shy of the Betashares Geared US Equity Fund. The report attributes the outperformance of crypto ETFs to a higher risk appetite by investors amid a globally favourable interest environment – although Australia has yet to see any interest rate easing. As share markets across the globe continue to reach all-time highs, funds that had magnified exposure to these markets, such as leverage ETFs, also made it into the top-performing funds over the past year. And the market for crypto funds in Australia gets only more competitive, which is a good thing for consumers. Locals have access to Bitcoin ETFs on the ASX via the DigitalX Bitcoin fund BTXX and VanEck’s VBTC fund. The Cboe lists Monochrome’s IBTC Bitcoin fund, the IETH Ethereum fund, and – as mentioned – Global X’s 21 Shares EBTC for Bitcoin and EETH for Ethereum. Related:SEC Files Appeal in Ripple Case Amid Controversy Over Allegedly Missed Deadline These funds provide access to Bitcoin and Ethereum in a well-regulated way and investors do not need to worry about losing their keys. Given their popularity, it’s likely that more asset managers will consider launching similar products, increasing consumer choice. Aaron Feuerstein is a freelance writer based in Melbourne.

    "news_title": "Chainalysis Report Reveals Asia and Oceania Lead in Global Crypto Adoption",
    "news_content": "Chainalysis has just revealed itslatest reporton the state of crypto called “The 2024 Geography of Crypto Report – Everything you need to know about regional trends in crypto adoption.” And, of course, the North American market is a key player in the crypto industry. North America (here the US and Canada, as the report excluded Mexico) accounts for 22.5% of crypto activity worldwide, with a whopping US$1.3 trillion (AU$1.93 trillion) in on-chain value. Related:Analysts Think Uptober Top in for Bitcoin, Memecoin Supercycle Next? This is of course no surprise, given the 2024 arrival of institutional investors and theUS Spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Eric Jardine, cyber-crimes research lead at Chainalysis, toldFortune: It’s just fundamentally changed the scene in the North American setting, but with global ramifications. While the US remains an important player in the global crypto market, it’s not the region with the fastest adoption. Despite US funds helping to legitimise crypto as an investment, other regions have not been idle. The Index evaluates countries based on cryptocurrency transaction volumes in varied scenarios, adjusted for each country’s GDP per capita using PPP (purchasing power parity), making comparisons fairer by considering economic differences. Related:SEC Files Appeal in Ripple Case Amid Controversy Over Allegedly Missed Deadline The index analyses four areas: total crypto value and retail transactions both through centralised services and decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols. Each category weights the data to favour countries where crypto transactions are significant relative to personal incomes, emphasising regions where cryptocurrency adoption is notably impactful compared to the local economy. This helps to identify where digital currencies are most integrated into economic activities, factoring in both overall and retail-specific engagements. According to Chainalysis the Central & Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO) region is one of the most influential, with seven of the top 20 countries in the CSAO area. According to the report, India ranks first overall, as well as in centralised services and retail, second in retail DeFi, and third in DeFi value. Nigeria, Indonesia, and the US occupy the next four spots. Others, like the United Kingdom, landed on the 12th spot, while Canada, South Korea and China took spots 18 to 20. Related:Trump’s World Liberty Financial Fails to Take Off, Labelled ‘Uninteresting Money Grab’ The report also noted that between late 2023 and early 2024, global cryptocurrency activity surged, surpassing the high levels seen during the 2021 bull market, reflecting significant growth in worldwide crypto adoption. Australia meanwhile is a little further down on the Global Crypto Adoption Index, taking spot 39. However, in the CSAO region, Australia ranks fourth for crypto value received.

    "news_title": "Binance APAC Exec Urges Cyber Security Awareness, Reveals Four Simple Steps for Investors",
    "news_content": "Coinciding with Australia’sCybersecurity Awareness Month, the head of Binance’s law enforcement training, Jarek Jakubcek, has urged Aussies to be aware of cybersecurity risks in anarticleappearing inThe Australiantoday. Jakubcek said the incidence ofcyber scamsin Australia continues to skyrocket withover 600,000cases being reported in 2023, but at the same time financial losses from these scams have actually fallen,down 13.1%from 2022 and now sitting at $2.74 billion. Despite the increase in the incidence of cyber scams, Jakubcek says crypto-specific scams havedeclined globallyin recent years, a trend he attributes to blockchain’s inherent transparency and traceability. Jakubcek also says taking simple steps to strengthen your security, such as enabling multi-factor authentication and using strong passwords, can significantly reduce the risk of losing money to scams. Related:ABC Report: Aussies Targeted for Crypto Scams as “Easy Prey” Jakubcek citesdatafrom Chainalysis showing that the amount of crypto flowing to known illicit addresses globally has been falling steadily over the past few years — in 2023 it sat at US$24.2 billion, down from US$39.6 billion in 2022. While US$24.2 billion is a huge amount of money, Jakubcek says it should be understood in context: We need to put this into perspective, as the overall size of illicit finance is in the trillions: at US$3.1 trillion in 2023 according to NASDAQ, while the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that between 2-5% of global GDP is laundered each year, the current equivalent of up to US$2 trillion. Jakubcek also highlights the discrepancy in the accuracy of estimates of the size of the blockchain illicit finance market compared to the total market — saying that this difference is largely due to the much improved transparency and traceability of blockchain technology over traditional fiat payment methods. “Globally, governments, regulators, and law enforcement authorities are recognising the benefits of this transparency and the power of crypto and the blockchain in protecting citizens from cybercriminals. Working with global law enforcement, Binance recovered or froze US$73 million in illicit funds in 2024,” he said. He described the battle between scammers and those looking to thwart them as a “cat-and-mouse game” saying that while crypto tech is an important tool “to help identify and investigate rising cybercrime”, joint effort from “government, industry and individuals” is required to stay ahead of cybercriminals. He reiterated the four simple steps to significantly buff your cybersecurity being promoted during Cyber Security Awareness Month by the Australian Cyber Security Centre, which are: Related:ASIC Clamps Down on 615 Crypto Scam Websites as Fraudulent Activities Surge to $1.3 Billion Jakubcek also noted that understanding crypto tech and market dynamics is important for investors in order to avoid falling victim to scams. ..it is important for individuals to do their own research, understand the technology behind cryptocurrencies, take proper security measures, and avoid guaranteed offers of high returns.

    "news_content": "As the crypto market makes its way up higher, with Bitcoin,Solanaand Ethereum all up around 11% week-on-week, there seems to be renewed interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The past few trading days have added over US$600 million (AU$900 million) to the fund’s AUM (assets under management). Related:Real-World Asset Tokenisation Set for Explosive Growth, Predicts Report As per CryptoQuant, these funds now hold a combined US$60 billion (AU$90 billion) in AUM – that’s over 900,000 BTC. Over $600 million worth of#Bitcoinhas been added to the Spot$BTCETF holdings in the last two trading days.The total Assets Under Management (AUM), including Grayscale, now stands at ~$60.0 billion.pic.twitter.com/ERdUhu9stv Out of all the funds,BlackRock’sIBIT has added the mostBitcoinby far. IBIT added US$288.8 million (AU$433.1 million) in the most recent trading day, bringing the monthly total to US$572 million (AU$857.7 million). Fidelity’s FBTC had the second largest inflows, with several funds having zero net inflows. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the recent inflows ‘monster flows’, hinting that the funds may achieve the 1 million Bitcoin milestone by the end of the year. Monster flow day for the bitcoin ETFs, over half a billion, total net flows (most imp number) hair away from $20b. They now 94% of way to holding 1mil btc and 85% away from passing Satoshi as largest holder in world- legit shot to hit milestone by Xmas. Ht@EdmondsonShaunhttps://t.co/XfhPuJ7Fqlpic.twitter.com/0Rxy3Yn7WJ While Bitcoin funds are doing obviously quite well,the same can’t be said for Ethereum funds. The US funds which launched in July 2024 have not had an easy start, trailing Bitcoin funds in popularity. This hasn’t stopped asset managers from launching new funds though,with Monochrome recently bringing an Ether fund to Australia’s Cboe. In an emailed statement to Crypto News Australia, Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, commented on the launch’s significance. Kan noted that Monochrome’s spot Ether ETF mirrors Hong Kong’s crypto ETFs by offering dual trading options in both cash and physical ETH, enhancing liquidity and investment flexibility. Related:Swyftx Reveals OTC Insights: PEPE a Top Traded Asset Among High Volume Investors He highlighted the supportive regulatory frameworks in Australia and Hong Kong that facilitate crypto investments through regulated markets, as well as the increasing acceptance of both crypto in general andETHin particular: The launch of Monochrome’s spot Ether ETF in Australia is a sign of growing institutional acceptance of crypto assets, adding credibility to Ether as an investment vehicle and giving investors more regulated options to gain exposure. This move also reflects a broader trend of increasing demand for spot crypto ETFs across the globe.  Aaron Feuerstein is a freelance writer based in Melbourne.

    "news_title": "Crypto Analyst Miles Deutscher Reveals Bullish RWA Altcoin Play",
    "news_content": "Aussie analyst Miles Deutscher’slatest video dives into all thingsaltcoins, as the market slowly starts to kick into gear.Bitcoinhas been a clear leader in the crypto sphere over the past month, heck, past year, with its dominance rising and most altcoins lagging in performance. However,meme coins have risen in the last weekor two, withDogecoinand PEPE in particular starting a new bullish trend. This is typically a sign of improving investor sentiment and can be a leading indicator for anoverall altcoin push. Deutscher notes that meme coins have demonstrated remarkable strength over the past six months, being the “number one leading narrative in the market” (besides Bitcoin). Additionally, the Aussie host touches onartificial intelligenceas another strong performer of late, with the convergence of the two leading crypto sub-sectorsactualising upon the release of Goatseus Maximus. Despite all the bullishness around meme coins and AI, Deutscher believes there’s another sector that investors should begin turning their attention to as we look toward 2025. Related:Lionel Messi to Star in ‘MLS Quest’ Collectibles Series on Sui Blockchain Real-world assettokenisationis one of themost important topics in the crypto world. It represents one of the greatest intersections between TradFi and DeFi, something institutions like BlackRock andFranklin Templeton are already leveraging. However, according to Deutscher, this could be just the beginning. His latest video notes that yields – both on-chain and off-chain – are dropping as a result ofinterest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve. In particular, Deutscher notes that “ponzi-like” projects are becoming few and far between, with investors becoming more capable of navigating a complex DeFi ecosystem. Due to this, Deutscher believes on-chain Treasury yields as a potential game-changer that provides a stable alternative to falling DeFi yields. The success of projects like BlackRock’s BUIDLhas opened the door for further RWA innovation – with Deutscher suggesting that tokenisation is likely coming to assets such as stocks and real estate – although this may be a while away. It’s one thing to say that a particular sector is going to perform well, but how do investors take advantage of it? Deutscher predicts that one RWA project in particular presents a profit opportunity head and shoulders above the rest – so much so that he sold several other bullish positions to make a sizable investment. In his latest video, Deutscher reveals Chintai as one of his top picks for the tokenisation sector that hasn’t seen much social media exposure. He argues that Chintai has a solid regulatory backing, as it is licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore – making it a more attractive proposition for high-net-worth institutional capital. Related:Bitcoin Eyes New All-Time High as Over $172 Million in BTC Liquidated Additionally, Chintai has secured impressive partnerships with prominent market players like Stable, GreeniX and receives support from the Singapore FinTech Association. There are roadblocks before Deutscher’s prediction of a 20x run comes to fruition – particularly in the form of marketing. He believes that marketing is the key barrier separating Chintai from the exposure of other similarRWA projectssuch asMantraand ONO. Whether Deutscher is proven correct on Chintai, there’s no doubt that real-world asset tokenisation is set to play a major role in the next evolution of Web3 technology.

    "news_content": "Crypto related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gaining traction. Following the approval of severalSpot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States,Australia,Hong Kong, and others, we hadEthereum ETFsstart trading in several jurisdictions. This was followed by a frenzy of activity around crypto-related ETFs. In early October,Canary CapitalandBitwisefiled applications for a couple ofXRPETFs. Although these are seen as applications with aslim chance, as the fight betweenRipple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)rages on. Related:Arthur Hayes Reveals How China Could Help Bitcoin Surge And just two weeks agoGrayscale moved to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund. The fund which holds a basket of cryptocurrencies likeBitcoin,Ethereum,Solana, and others, has been trading since 2018 but not as an ETF but rather as an over-the-counter (OTC) product. Securities exchange NYSE Arca has recently filed to list the fund as an ETF, a fund that currently holds US$565 million (AU$860 million) in assets under management (AUM). And not to forget, the SEC has approvedoptions tradingon the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs, pending final approval by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Now, Canary Capital Group, a relatively young digital asset investment firm, is making headlines by filing for several crypto-relatedETFsin a row. The company, founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, submitted a filing on 15 October for a Litecoin ETF, just a week after it filed for an XRP ETF. And now, less than two weeks later, they filed for a Solana ETF. Update:@CanaryFundsjust filed for a Solana ETFpic.twitter.com/3OhdfaKVrw The company is so young it hasn’t even got any listed ETFs, according to Bloomberg ETF guru James Seyffart. In a statement, Canary praised Solana as a “battle-tested frontrunner for decentralized applications”. Solana’s robust DeFi ecosystem has led to strong sustained on-chain analytics as measured by transactions per day, active addresses and new addresses, while maintaining a low fee environment for all consumers. The firm believes that Solana can solidify its stronghold as one of the top crypto assets with “future growth in native on-chain stablecoin deployment”. Related:Arthur Hayes Reveals How China Could Help Bitcoin Surge The US doesn’t have any approved Solana ETFs thus far, withVanEck being the other applicantwith a pending ETF there. Another notable development for Solana exchange-traded products is the exchange-traded note (ETN) VSOL, a VanEck product,which now allows Europeans to earn staking rewards. Meanwhile,Brazil had a Spot Solana ETF approvedby the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) in August. Aaron Feuerstein is a freelance writer based in Melbourne.

    "news_title": "Monochrome Launches First Australian Spot Ethereum ETF on Cboe",
    "news_content": "Monochrome Asset Management, led by CEO Jeff Yew, has launched Australia’s first spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE —again, the Australian version), marking a significant milestone for the country’s cryptocurrency market. The company held a private event in Sydney last week to mark the upcoming launch of the IETH fund. Introducing the Monochrome Ethereum ETF (Ticker: IETH).IETH is Australia’s first ETF that provides direct access to Ethereum with an in-kind subscription and redemption facility.$IETHbegins trading today, under the ticker ‘IETH’.Full announcement 🔽https://t.co/dv0Ggiltc3pic.twitter.com/NAbZ6yoKaO Related:Monochrome Asset Management to Launch Ethereum ETF on Cboe Australia Trading of Monochrome’s Ethereum ETF (IETH) began on Tuesday at 10 AM AEDT. Monochrome’s IETH ETF will track the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate (Asia Pacific Variant) and feature a management fee of 0.50%, with a reduced rate of 0.21% for accredited advisers. This makes its fees competitive with similar productsin the US market, which typically offer rates between 0.20% and 0.25%. This launch follows the success of Monochrome’s Bitcoin ETF (IBTC), which debuted in August 2023 and has since amassed AU$15 million. And yes —this is modest compared to the large sums held in US crypto ETFs. However, Monochrome’s focus is on its unique structure. The company claims to offer the world’s first-in-kind Ethereum subscriptions and redemptions, a feature designed to provide tax advantages, as Yew told Decrypt in an exclusive interview. The overall idea is that the investment you place in the ETF is treated as if you were owning the coin. This is called a bare trust, and it essentially means that any actions taken by the trustee are treated as actions of the investors, so no capital gain taxes are triggered upon redemption or transfer. The ETF will be accessible to most Australian brokers and will support transfers from cryptocurrency platforms, decentralised wallets, and cold wallets. BitGo and Gemini will provide custody services, and State Street Australia will serve as the fund administrator. Related:ABC Report: Aussies Targeted for Crypto Scams as “Easy Prey” Monochrome hopes this launch will position the fund as a significant player in the Australian crypto market. Monochrome has not responded to CNA’s requests for comments. Updated the headline on 18 October 2024, to reflect that the Global X Ethereum ETF was launched in 2022. The Monochrome Ethereum ETF offers a dual-access bare trust structure, allowing direct transfer of Ethereum into the ETF without tax implications, aiming to provide a simpler and potentially more tax-efficient investment option. In contrast, the Global X Ethereum ETF uses a traditional trust structure that grants investors direct entitlement to Ethereum held in custody, ensuring that the ETF’s value closely tracks the spot price of Ethereum.

    "news_title": "How to Buy Ethereum in Australia in 2024",
    "news_content": "  Buying Ethereum in Australia is very simple and can be done with just a few clicks. There are several exchanges to choose from, each with their pros and cons.  Our pick as the best exchange to purchase ETH is Swyftx due to their easy-to-use app, low trading fees, helpful customer support and wide range of additional features. Simply sign up, verify your identification, deposit AUD and then purchase your desired amount of ETH.  Ethereum is a decentralised ledger that runs on blockchain technology. It was designed to host decentralised applications (dApps) and execute smart contracts, the first of its kind. Additionally, projects can easily create tokens that reside on the Ethereum blockchain. These types of tokens are known as ERC-20. Unlike Bitcoin, the Ethereum network runs on a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, which requires network participants to stake ETH instead of mining crypto. Related:Ethereum staking guide The Ethereum platform is powered by Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second largest cryptocurrency in the world based on market cap. The safest way you can buy Ethereum (ETH) in Australia is through a reputable crypto trading platform or exchange. Some exchanges offer more crypto assets than others, however, most crypto exchanges will allow trading for popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) monitors and regulates digital currency exchanges so that it complies with national standards, it is highly recommended to go through an AUSTRAC-registered exchange. Below are four key steps to purchasing Ethereum: For this example, we’ll be using the Swyftx cryptocurrency exchange to demonstrate how you can buy and store Ethereum in Australia. Swyftx is an AUSTRAC-registered exchange with offices located in Brisbane and Sydney. Their beginner-centric Ethereum exchange is very easy to sign up for, and they have Australian-based customer support to help if you need assistance along the way. Other Australian exchanges like Coinspot, Digitial Surge and Coinjar have similar sign-up processes. Creating a Swyftx account couldn’t be simpler. You will have to supply some basic information – your phone number, full name, and email address. When this is complete you will be asked to create a password. It is important to create a password that is unique and secure. Once your password is created, make sure to write it down and keep it in a secure place or use a password manager like LastPass. Click hereto create your account. All AUSTRAC registered exchanges require users to complete identification checks by uploading a photo of their identification document.  Once you are logged in, you will need to peruse the left-hand menu and select‘profile’ > ‘verification’. Your account’s verification is necessary for depositing fiat or purchasing crypto. A form of government-issued identification, such as a passport or driver’s license is required for verifying your account. To further enhance the security of your Swyftx account, it is strongly recommended that you enable two-factor authentication (2FA). This adds an extra layer of security in case your login details fall into the wrong hands. Google and Microsoft Authenticators are supported by most crypto exchanges. Once your account is verified, you can then deposit funds which can then be used to buy and sell Ethereum. Most exchanges will allow you to deposit through bank account transfers, Swyftx included. You can also deposit funds via your chosen payment method: POLi, PayID or credit or debit card. Swyftx does not charge any fees when you deposit via bank transfer. If you already have cryptocurrency in an external crypto wallet, you can deposit these assets directly into Swyftx using your new wallet address. These assets can then be swapped for ETH. Once you have a sum of Australian dollars (AUD) in your wallet, you are able to buy Ethereum instantly. To get started, clickTradeand search for Ethereum (ETH). Once you’re on the Ethereum page, selectBuy. A window will then pop up allowing you to input the details of your order. For instance, you can select how much ETH you wish to buy or input the AUD equivalent. Once you have reviewed your order details, simply clickPlace Order. Choosing the best place to purchase ETH can be overwhelming with so many options available. Selecting an Australian-based exchange is recommended as they are almost guaranteed to accept Australian dollars (AUD). This makes it easy to deposit funds to purchase crypto quickly. It is also important to consider other aspects like the exchange’s security reputation, user-friendliness, customer support, regulation, and trading fees. Read our comparison of thebest crypto exchanges in Australiafor more information. Yes, buying and selling Ethereum is legal in Australia as long as you’re doing it on an AUSTRAC-registered exchange. However, it is important to note there are tax laws that apply to crypto. As it stands, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) considers digital currencies to be assets, meaning Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applies to profit or losses on your Ethereum investment. For a comprehensive breakdown of crypto tax, read thisAustralian crypto tax guide. No investment is ever guaranteed to be safe. Whilst Ethereum is one of the more popular cryptocurrencies on the market, it is still at the mercy of market volatility. Any crypto purchase you intend to make should be thoroughly researched, so that you properly weigh the risks, and understand how your investment will operate. There is a lot to learn about your potential ETH investment; however, for a beginner, it is necessary that you understand price volatility, exchange vulnerabilities, and regulatory uncertainty. Doing so allows you to better gauge whether your investment could be considered a ‘safe’ one. If you’re not yet confident to buy Ethereum, some exchanges offer free cryptodemo accountswhere you can trade crypto with artificial money. This is a great way to learn about the market and practice your trading strategies. Vitalik Buterin created Ethereum in 2013, and it then went on to become the first network to facilitate smart contracts. The Ethereum blockchain gained a lot of its popularity by hosting a number of decentralised applications, allowing users to interact with DeFi, play-to-earn crypto games, the Metaverse, and NFTs. Possessing more than $40 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), the blockchain quickly became the world’s largest smart contract platform. If you’ve ever engaged with, or heard of, MetaMask, OpenSea, The Sandbox, Axie infinity or UniSwap, you have Ethereum to thank. Solana has emerged as a key competitor of Ethereum. You can view ourEthereum vs Solanacomparison.  As with any investment, you can make aninformeddecision about whether you think it will be worth your money. However, it’s impossible to predict the performance of your asset with complete accuracy.  If your goal is to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, you will need to own some ETH.  Most exchanges will charge a small trading fee; however, as mentioned above, Swyftx does not charge any fees when you deposit via bank transfer. There are some services in circulation that allow you to buy ETH instantly using a debit or credit card. Coinspot is one exchange that allows its users to buy crypto instantly using a debit or credit card. Most exchanges will allow crypto investors to purchase Ethereum with a debit card. This works by allowing you to transfer funds to your wallet from your debit card as a deposit. The eToro exchange permits PayPal deposits; however, this is an outlier amongst many exchanges.

    "news_title": "Top 7 Crypto Demo Accounts in Australia | Crypto News Australia",
    "news_content": "If you’re curious about crypto but slightly overwhelmed by the possibilities of the market, a crypto demo account can be the perfect starting point. Demo trading, also called paper trading, is the practice of utilising simulated funds to try your hand at cryptocurrency trading without the attached risk from a real transaction. Jumping headfirst into crypto trading, as a beginner, can significantly increase your chances of losing money. Therefore, it is imperative that every trader is aware of the risks associated with the market, and that they are prepared to make smart financial decisions. With the crypto market known for its volatility, a crypto demo account provides the perfect ‘safe space’ to learn crypto trading and experiment with different trading strategies. There are multiple demo crypto and bitcoin trading accounts on offer for those looking to experience the market. This page will cover the tips, tricks, and benefits of demo trading, alongside an introduction to some of the best crypto demo accounts in circulation. Crypto demo trading is an exercise designed to offer a trader the opportunity to gain exposure to market conditions and practice trading without risking their own money. When you begin your demo, you will receive a sum of artificial money that you can put towards buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrency. A virtual account is typically linked to real market data, meaning that not only can these accounts be useful for crypto beginners, but they also provide the perfect opportunity for more experienced traders to try various strategies. Demo accounts can be found on numerous trading platforms and crypto exchanges. Not all crypto practice accounts are available for free; however, most will be. Each platform will vary in terms of usability, available trading tools and crypto pairs, and beginner-friendliness. Checkout ourtop crypto exchangescomparison. There are several benefits associated with demo trading. Not only are these practice accounts excellent for helping beginner investors find their feet within the market, but they also provide the perfect environment for experienced traders to trial trading strategies. Put simply, the benefits of crypto demo accounts are that they can be: Important to remember:Experimenting with a free demo account does not substitute thorough investment research. These accounts serve to allow traders to put their research to the test.  Ensure you are knowledgeable about the trading you wish to partake in, and then utilise a demo account to build on this. Unfortunately, most crypto exchanges and trading platforms don’t offer a demo mode. However, there are still several options available to Aussies. The following will be a comprehensive list of all the best demo accounts, to help simplify your decision. Swyftx demo mode is beginner-friendly, prioritising ease of use and allowing traders to imitate most of the trading features Swyftx has to offer. Swyftx demo mode is quite intuitive and designed to mimic its real-world trading platform. Therefore, any potential confusion a trader might experience when switching Swyftx’s actual trading platform is removed. As the demo platform is aligned with the live platform, users can access features such as: Every Swyftx demo account is credited with $10,000 USD of virtual funds, called ‘Mock Currency’. The balance cannot be added to once the account is opened; however, the customer support team can reset your Swyftx demo trading mode upon request. These funds can be used to buy, sell and trade BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, ADA and hundreds more. It couldn’t be easier to get started with a Swyftx crypto demo, all you need to do is: It is important that you see the yellow banner if you are intending to trade crypto using the demo mode. If you’d like to trade with real-market data and zero financial risk, a Swyftx demo account might be right for you.  Trading platform and global financial brokerage, eToro, offers one of the more comprehensive demo accounts. Notably, the eToro demo mode permits its users to trade across a much broader range of markets, including stocks, commodities, currencies, indices, ETFs, and crypto. eToro’s demo crypto trading account grants traders $100,000 in artificial funds to put towards the development of a virtual portfolio. Aside from Bitcoin demo trading, eToro allows users to select from 15 other cryptocurrencies for their mock transactions. Additionally, a standout feature for the eToro demo is the ‘social trading news feed’. This is the perfect space for interaction with other traders, offering you the opportunity to share your strategies or learn from others. Whilst you should not blindly follow a strategy without conducting your own research, this can be a great way to learn from more experienced traders. This social platform can be sorted by ‘popular investors’, thereby giving you direct access to the strategies of successful traders. 1.Create an account with eToroby providing your email address and creating a secure username and password. 2. Access your ‘Virtual Portfolio’: Under your username, you will be presented with a dropdown. Click ‘Virtual portfolio’ which will take you to your demo account. 3. Begin trading: Your artificial funds will be deposited, and you are ready to begin to practise trading with real-time market data. The eToro demo account enables traders to follow each investment’s real-time trends thanks to advanced analysis tools. Traders can also experiment with applying leverage, Stop Loss, and Take Profit features. eToro also lets its customers access ready-made thematic portfolios for further ease of use. Crypto’s biggest exchange, Binance, calls its demo trading account ‘Mock Trading’; this can be found under Binance Futures trading. Futures is a more speculative trading style that involves trading derivative contracts at a set future price and date. The simulation trading platform is less accessible than other demos; however, as Futures trading is quite risky, learning without financial commitments can be very valuable. Once you open your Binance Futures testnet (demo) account, you are credited 3000 USDT which is the equivalent of $3000 USD. Your virtual portfolio will permit you to utilise up to 25x leverage, place stop-losses, and take profit orders. The testnet also allows traders to adjust the risk level, providing an opportunity for investors of all calibres to grow. This demo account can additionally be accessed on mobile. Note that the Mock Trading environment’s candlestick charts and prices may differ from the market value. Note that one negative aspect of the Binance demo account is that it does not cater to spot trading. The charting and social networking site, TradingView, was initially focused on stock scanning and charting. However, the site recently bridged into cryptocurrency and now monitors the historical prices of trading pairs across a variety of markets. Studying historical prices and conducting technical analysis can be useful for identifying patterns that may translate to the future price movements of assets. TradingView is not an exchange; therefore, users cannot deposit and trade with real currency. However, TradingView does offer demo crypto trading, permitting its users to learn from its advanced charting system. TradingView calls its demo crypto account ‘Paper Trading’ and primarily caters to more advanced traders who seek to utilise a variety of charting tools to expand on their existing knowledge. Some of the key features of a TradingView crypto demo include: Plus500 is notably one of the top-performing Contract for Difference (CFD) trading platforms. CFD means that traders are investing in financial products which track the prices of assets such as stocks, indices, Forex, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies. Due to this, any funds you invest in crypto, cannot be withdrawn to an external wallet. Plus500 is especially good for beginners, as it can teach aspiring traders the ropes. The interface is easy to use, and the ‘order entry window’ summarises useful trades for beginners using the demo crypto account. Demo users can trade their CFDs with up to 30x leverage and can use artificial funds to trade with 17 different cryptocurrencies. Thanks to its functionality, Plus500 allows seasoned traders to practice high-risk trades. Tutorials can be accessed to guide beginner traders, and customer service is available at any time. Once you feel that you have had enough practice under your belt, the process of switching back to live trading is simple. Note that if the sum of your artificial funds drops under $200, your balance will be reset. BitMart is known for its multiple interesting features, including trading futures, crypto lending, and staking. Its demo crypto account interface almost perfectly matches its live trading interface and gives users access to integrated TradingView charts, which offer a range of technical indicators to assist with trading strategies. The user interface does have some slight variations in appearance for its futures markets, as to include the leverage options. The practice account supplies a practice amount for the purchase of cryptocurrencies. And, whilst most live features can be accessed on the demo, switching to live trading offers multiple features, including: Bitsgap is a trading platform with several valuable features, such as allowing users to manage multiple portfolios, trade multiple digital assets, and access trading bots. Integrated with 25 of the biggest global cryptocurrency exchanges (such as Kraken and Coinbase Pro), Bitsgap’s demo account (https://bitsgap.com/demo-trading) has access to all the features on its live trading platform. The demo account operates by replicating its supported exchange’s order books, offering traders the opportunity to: Once your account is up and running you will receive 10 (demo) Bitcoin. This Bitcoin demo trading will help you to polish your trading skills at your own pace. The primary aim of utilising demo trading is to learn in the most realistic scenario imaginable, without the attached financial risk. Therefore, to ensure you achieve this goal, we have compiled some tips to make sure your experience is as practical as possible. If you can successfully disassociate from the notion that demo trading is fake, and instead pretend the funds you use are real, you are more likely to learn from the experience. Moving into a demo experience fully committed to the concept that you are using real money, limits the chances of you making reckless decisions you might otherwise avoid. The downside of a demo account is that, for some, removing the risk also removes the commitment to learn the basic fundamentals of crypto trading. Therefore, pretending that all the financial risk remains, will likely prompt you to make smarter decisions, and you will thereby take more from the opportunity. The difference between the value of an asset when an order is placed, and its value when the order is fulfilled, is called slippage. Slippage can result in either a loss or a gain, and it is imperative that you take this into account in both a crypto demo and live trading. You can work on accounting for slippage in your demo trading by: Consider slippage when choosing the exchange you will eventually live trade with, as some exchanges have more features to aid with this than others. Whilst you should do your best to pretend that your demo crypto account trading is real, don’t neglect the fact that you can experiment with the volume of your trades. Making higher volume trades that you might traditionally avoid in the real market is a great way to play with the concept of risk and reward. At the end of the day, demo accounts create a safe environment for you to test your ideas and develop new strategies! Just because you have experimented with the best crypto demo accounts, and the real assets that you are interested in, does not mean you won’t require further research. Any investment you make, whether crypto-related or not, should be supported by in-depth research and understanding. Once you switch to live trading the risk is real and making reckless trades without conducting thorough research can end up costing you. Key Takeaways:Simulated trading is designed to offer you the opportunity to experiment with the market without fear of financial loss. There are multiple demo accounts on offer to suit traders of all experience levels. You can utilize these accounts to learn or test strategies; however, demo experimentation will never substitute quality investment research.

    "news_content": "XRP is one of the cryptocurrency market’s most prominent coins and regularly sits in the top 10 assets based on market cap. Thanks to the coin’s popularity, many well-known crypto trading platforms offer XRP. That said, the easiest way for beginners to add XRP to their crypto portfolio is by using a centralised exchange such as Swyftx. Centralised exchanges are the best way for inexperienced investors to buy XRP. The top companies in this space typically implement excellent security measures, consumer protections in case of theft, and simple fiat-to-crypto on-ramping solutions. XRP is a commonly sought-after digital currency listed on most major centralised exchanges, like Swyftx. In general, Australians should look for a reputable investment platform that accepts AUD and suits their broader financial goals. If the business running the exchange is based in Australia – even better. Veteran crypto traders may wish to acquire XRP through other means. This can include using a peer-to-peer exchange or a platform that offers derivatives. However, not all of these businesses support depositing AUD, which can result in costly conversion fees. Another option for seasoned investors is using decentralised exchanges (DEXs) to buy XRP. Such platforms typically have minimal sign-up requirements and lower fees than their centralised counterparts. That said, only some of these exchanges accept fiat currency and they can be quite difficult and risky to use. The first step is to compare crypto exchanges and pick one best suited to your financial goals. There are several factors to consider when deciding on a platform – transaction fees, crypto and fiat currencies supported, security history and brand reputation. The majority of prominent crypto trading platforms offer a streamlined process formaking an account. Most investors only need to supply a valid email address and mobile phone number to quickly register a new exchange account. However, due to Australia’s Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, users are unable to deposit or withdraw AUD (or another fiat currency) until they verify their identity. This process used to be time-consuming, but most modern exchanges have automated account verification and it now only takes a few minutes. To verify a Swyftx account, new users must provide proof of identification. This can be done using government-issued documents such as a Driver’s License or a Passport. Performing the verification process on a supported smartphone will make taking photos of these documents a smoother experience. Before buying XRP, investors must fund their accounts with a supported fiat currency. In Australia, most prominent exchanges such as Swyftx support AUD deposits. Several deposit methods usually exist, including direct deposit via PayID and Osko or credit/debit card payments. Swyftx does not charge any deposit fees themselves, however, small costs may be passed on from the provider’s side. Now that the investor’s account is loaded with cash, it’s time to buy XRP. Executing the purchase is usually quite simple – the user must navigate to the exchange’s “Trade” hub, click “Buy” and select “XRP” from the list of supported coins. Then finally, enter the amount of AUD to be spent (or XRP to be purchased) and submit the order. Double-check all the details are correct, including the fees being charged, before confirming the transaction. Once complete, the XRP should hit the exchange’s native wallet within a few minutes. XRP is one of the crypto industry’s oldest blockchain projects, coming to life in 2012. Backed by developers David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto, XRP intends to disrupt the current financial industry by making international payments faster, cheaper and more secure. The project, once named Company New Coin and then Ripple, is built atop the XRP Ledger. The Ledger is an open-source, public blockchain that improved on previous technology’s scalability and efficiency. Renowned for its low fees, XRP can be sent across the Ledger for less than $0.0002 in gas fees with a 3-4 seconds confirmation time. DID YOU KNOW Despite what many think, Ripple and XRP are not interchangeable. Ripple refers to Ripple Labs, the company responsible for building the XRP Ledger and associated cryptocurrency. On the other hand, XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger network. Exchange wallets are the most convenient and fastest way to store XRP. Most reputable exchanges, including Swyftx, come with native wallets built into the platform. This means whenever an investor purchases XRP, it is automatically stored in a wallet linked with their exchange account. Top-tier centralised exchange wallets come with multiple layers of security, including storage in a mix of hot and cold wallets and industry-standard encryption. However, events such as FTX’s collapse in 2022 have led investors to reconsider the safety of exchange wallets. For the most part, platforms like Swyftx offer secure storage options for those wishing to hold onto XRP long-term. That said, investors should always consider non-custodial alternatives too. Hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano and Trezor T are considered the safest method of digital asset storage. These wallets come as a physical device resembling a mini hard drive or USB dongle. Hardware wallets must be connected to a computer to be used, which means they are inaccessible to hackers when disconnected. This process makes hardware wallets a little inconvenient to use for day traders, and they can be a little costly. Online wallets is an umbrella term for browser extensions, desktop applications or websites that support storing XRP. Also known as hot wallets, there are several excellent, non-custodial products that can be used to safely hold an XRP portfolio, including: On Swyftx, there are four ways for investors to deposit AUD to buy XRP. Perhaps the most popular deposit method is a direct bank transfer. Most Australian bank providers now support Osko, which means direct deposits will hit your Swyftx account within seconds. This fast and free method has a minimum deposit of $30 AUD, and a maximum daily deposit of $50,000. PayID is a common payment method in Australia that lets investors pay others based on a registered email or mobile number. The convenient payment method can be used on Swyftx for free and near-instant AUD deposits. PayID shares the same deposit limits as bank transfers. Investors can also use the payment gateway POLi to send money from their bank account to Swyftx via an online portal. Like others, this payment method is near-instant and completely free. The minimum POLi deposit is $30 AUD, while the maximum daily deposit is $20,000. Finally, investors can use their debit or credit cards to deposit AUD and purchase XRP. Swyftx is partnered with payment gateway Stripe to facilitate these transactions, which charge a 1.99% fee on all deposits. Only Visas and Mastercards can be used, and the maximum daily deposit is $15,000. Spot buying, or spot markets, are instant markets facilitated by cryptocurrency exchanges using an order book. Spot buying allows investors to purchase XRP at the current market price, or, to set up an order that executes when XRP hits a certain value. Someone that spot buys XRP is essentially buying the asset from someone else who has agreed to sell XRP at that price. This way of purchasing XRP requires the associated trading account to be funded with fiat currency like AUD, or another cryptocurrency. Instant buying XRP can have a few different connotations, but generally refers to buying cryptocurrency without any funds in the trading account. Investors enter the amount of XRP they wish to buy, or AUD they want to spend. Then, they can attach an eligible debit or credit card to immediately purchase the desired asset. This method of buying XRP generally doesn’t allow customers to designate a purchase price – they must buy XRP at its current market value, with plenty of fees sprinkled on top. Regulation should always be a major consideration for investors before investing in any crypto asset. However, this is especially true for XRP, as the blockchain project became embroiled in a legal battle with US regulators the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The project’s native token – also named XRP – came under fire from the SEC in 2023 for its unique distribution method. Whereas coins like Bitcoin (Proof-of-work) and Ethereum (Proof-of-stake) are mined or validated, XRP’s entire supply of 100B was “pre-mined” and released upon the blockchain’s launch. The outcome of the SEC tussle, as well as future regulations, will play a huge role in XRP’s long-term success in the industry. XRP has seen institutional interest as a cheap alternative to banks for international transactions. Financial giants like Invesco, BlackRock and WisdomTree have all added XRP to their portfolios. XRP is positioning itself as a global disruptor for cheap, global payments. To achieve this, the project must continue to provide its services to big businesses as well as to everyday investors. XRP is a global payments currency – making it just one of the hundreds in the cryptosphere. Bitcoin, for example, was originally created to fulfill this very same niche (although it serves a different purpose in today’s industry). XRP is currently the top dog when it comes to adoption and market cap in this space. Still, the project must deal with traditional finance competitors like PayPal, Stripe and Wise, on top of Web3 solutions like Stellar Lumens. According to the ATO, XRP is viewed as property and therefore comes under Australia’s capital gains tax (CGT). Tax obligations for XRP come about whenever an investor disposes of the asset. This includes selling or swapping XRP, using it to buy goods and services or gifting it to a family member. Under such circumstances, investors must pay CGT on whatever their profits are. CGT requirements are halved for assets held for 12+ months before their disposal.If disposing of XRP incurs a loss, this figure can then be used to subtract from other capital gains. For example, say someone profited $100 from buying and selling Bitcoin, but they lost the same amount on trading XRP, their CGT obligations would be zero. However, deliberately incurring capital losses may result in theATO denying the claim. Ben Knight is a writer and editor from Melbourne with a passion for all things music and finance.

    "news_title": "Editorial Policy | Crypto News Australia",
    "news_content": " Crypto News’s editorial policy translates our legislative responsibilities, services, standards and expectations and guide decisions that are equitable, timely and consistent. It incorporates values concerned with social responsibility, ethical considerations and a sense of fair play. The editorial policy informs and guides our professional judgements, but also reassures our audience that their trust and expectations are not misplaced. Our following values guide our decisions. Neutrality is having an open mind and the absence of decided views, expression, or strong feeling. It is about openness and straight dealing by reporting the relevant facts and significant points of view and fair, ethical and balanced treatment of issues, events, people and institutions. Our news posts must conform to reality, be in context and not in any way misleading or false. Reporters should be enterprising and questioning in perceiving, pursuing and presenting issues. This demands thorough research and a disciplined use of language and writing techniques. Our reporters are not influenced by pressures from political, commercial or other sectional interests or by their own personal views or activities. There is no external interference in the presentation or content of news reports or any improper influence brought to bear internally. Respect for the rights of others may call for careful handling of sensitive issues such as violence, sex, grief, trauma, privacy invasions. We need to avoid stereotypes and other prejudicial content. We must respect interviewees and all others we deal with in the course of our news gathering and transmission activities. Our news reports reflect the broad diversity of cultures, interests and opinions.and draw on this diversity to present relevant views across the spectrum. In the coverage of issues, we do not promote or denigrate any view, including those of minorities. Views are covered according to their news value and significance. Journalists, producers and the editorial staff will have opinions of their own, but they must not yield to bias or prejudice. To be professional is not to be without opinions, but to be aware of those opinions and make allowances for them, so that reporting is, and appears to be, judicious and fair. Audiences should not detect a correspondent’s personal views. Our correspondents offer analysis of events or opinions in which the event or opinion is placed in a wider context and the audience are given a clearer idea of the significance of the issue. However, we do not give prescriptive comments or tell the audience what opinion they should hold. It is accepted that specialist reviewers, drawing upon their expertise, are able to express their opinion but mention it as their own opinions. CN has a duty to ensure that news reporting is fair, accurate and balanced. News balance should be achieved, where appropriate, within a single programme or otherwise within the period of current interest. Where an appropriate representative of one side of the story cannot be reached, the journalist should relay the fact in a simple and direct manner. Being very much in the public eye, it is essential that the public can trust the integrity of our journalists, contributors, and editorial staff. CN’s impartiality or credibility must not be influenced by any commercial, political or personal interests. It is particularly important that employees must not use the CN platform for their own interests. Sponsored content refers to content that is created by Crypto News covering a topic area that is relevant to an advertiser published in the press release or sponsored content section. Crypto News has sole editorial control, and no advertiser has any input into the content beyond the broad topic area. Sponsored content will also be labeled in one of the following ways: “Sponsored Article”, “Press Release”, “sponsored by our partners,” “sponsored by,” “from our sponsor,” “submitted by x”, or “brought to you by.” Rel “no sponsor” linking will also be applied to all sponsored posts and rel “no follow” for any commercial related press release. To produce high quality content for you – we seek expert knowledge from our Partners to ensure all of our content is correct and informative. This content may include images, references and links to the Partner, whom is assigned the Premium Category or is closely related to the article to which the content relates to. Please note, that the co-founders and other writers at Crypto News often do have business relationships with the companies and products that we cover. For instance, some of us own other Web businesses which earn revenue from the advertising networks that we review on Crypto News. We believe these business relationships inform our perspective and ultimately increase the value of our editorial content, but note that these relationships do exist, and we will not necessarily disclose them in an individual article. We strive to be objective and fair in our reviews of products, services and companies. We do not accept compensation of any type in exchange for a favorable review. We label sponsored content, disclose when we link to a product or company with an affiliate link, or if our co-founders own equity in a private business that’s being mentioned in our editorial content. We strive to be accurate, but we make mistakes. If you think we’ve made a mistake in one of our articles, pleasecontact us.

    "news_title": "Swyftx Review 2024: Is it a Good Exchange?",
    "news_content": "Swyftx is one of the best options on the market for Australian cryptocurrency investors. The platform offers low trading fees (0.6%) and tight spreads, making it a cost-effective crypto exchange for buying, selling and trading digital currencies. The crypto exchange’s streamlined design, support for recurring buys and live chat makes it a comfortable choice for complete cryptocurrency novices. More experienced users will enjoy comprehensive Tradingview charts, an OTC desk and a huge range of supported assets. Advanced derivatives traders may want to look for an alternative exchange, as Swyftx does not offer futures, options or perpetual contracts.  Swyftx is an Australian-based crypto exchange that launched in 2018. Founded by Alex Harper and Angus Goldman, the trading platform has seen massive growth over the last couple of years and has built a 600,000+ strong customer base. It’s considered a beginner-centric exchange due to its easy-to-navigate interface, great learning resources and features like demo mode. 0.1-0.6% Bank transfer: $0PayID: $0Credit card: 1.99% 0% 400+ Brisbane, Australia 3     Swyftx is an Australian cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in Milton, Brisbane. The platform was founded in 2017 by Alex Harper and Angus Goldman and has since expanded to service customers from New Zealand. The company also has plans to support customers from the UK and Canada. Users can buy, sell and trade over 310 crypto assets using the platform’s streamlined yet customisable user interface. The huge variety of digital assets on offer makes Swyftx an excellent choice for both beginner and more experienced investors. Australian crypto exchanges can be notorious for high, undisclosed spreads, but Swyftx is renowned for its fee transparency. The trading fee is a flat 0.6%, with the possibility of discounts based on high trading volume, and spreads are easily visible. The platform supports SMSF (Self-Managed Super Fund) accounts, advanced order options and a demo trading mode. Swyftx has established itself as a reliable, cost-effective and secure exchange in its relatively short life. Beginners and intermediate investors alike will find themselves at home using the platform, although advanced users wishing to trade derivatives will want to look elsewhere.  Swyftx has built a reputation among the Australian community for being a trustworthy and safe exchange. In its 3+ years of operation, the platform has never reported a hack or other compromising event. Swyftx is registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and abides by all Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) laws. The cryptocurrency exchange prioritises the safety of its customer’s assets and utilises a multi-tiered security approach. Swyftx uses industry-standard security measures such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA),cold storage, penetration testing, data encryption and the least privilege principle. Swyftx also aims to become one of the very few Australian exchanges to receive ISO 27001 certification. This certification is regarded as the international benchmark for security management. Swyftx does not currently offer an insurance fund for crypto assets and fiat currency held on the platform. This does not necessarily make Swyftx any less safe than alternatives — particularly given its sparklingly clean track record — but it is still worth keeping in mind. Swyftx has one of the best customer support services for Australians wanting tobuy and sell crypto. The platform hosts a comprehensive Help Centre, filled with 100+ helpful articles that  walk customers through depositing AUD, placing buy/sell orders or customising the dashboard. If the Help Centre doesn’t answer the question, Swyftx offers a 24/7 live chat. The support team is Australia-based and responsive, with wait times usually ten to fifteen minutes during work hours. Swyftx has a 4.7/5 star rating onTrustPilot(from 3,822 reviews) and a 4.6/5 star rating onProductReview(from 3,686 reviews), demonstrating the team’s excellent customer service. Australian crypto exchange platforms are generally a little costlier than international alternatives, but Swyftx’s competitive trading fees stack up well against its local and overseas competitors. Overall, Digital Surge is the only Australian exchange that currently has cheaper combined transaction fees and spreads than Swyftx. Swyftx charges a flat trading fee of 0.6% on all transactions. This includes buying and selling cryptocurrencies with AUD or swapping one coin for another. Customers can expect around a 1% trading fee on average when using other Australian exchanges like Coinspot, making Swyftx quite cost-effective. Related:Swyftx vs Coinspot: exchange comparison. Swyftx does not charge any fees on AUD deposits and withdrawals from an Australian bank account. Free and near-instant fiat transactions are a great feature of the exchange. The deposit and withdrawal limit for AUD is $50,000 per transaction, per day. However, both of these limits can be extended upon request. Credit/debit card deposits will incur a 3.6% third-party processing fee from Banxa. The maximum card deposit is $60,000 per month. Swyftx does not charge any fees for sending or receiving cryptocurrencies to a wallet. However, standard network (gas) fees will apply. Spreads are the difference in an asset’s price between the time an order is placed, and the time it is executed. Spreads are hidden fees that can make trades more expensive than they appear. Those new to trading may not know what spreads are and quickly become confused at the extra costs. Swyftx hangs its hat on providing some of the tightest spreads in Australia. The platform is transparent with the spreads for each trade, with fees starting as low as 0.45%. The overall average spread of 1.7% is extremely competitive in the Australian market. Some customers have reported Swyftx’s competitors charging very high spreads of over 4%. Swyftx’s trading interface is clean and easy to navigate. Beginners can easily build their portfolio by setting up instant orders for buying or selling cryptocurrency. Finding coins to purchase is easy — users can simply type the coin’s name into the search bar and click “Buy”. Alternatively, customers can sort through the 310+ digital currencies based on recent price movements or market cap. More experienced traders can set up advanced orders that trigger when an asset hits a specific price (effectively a limit order). This can be used to potentially buy or sell cryptocurrencies at a preferred value, instead of at the current market rate. The Swyftx trading terminal also offers a customisable chart. It’s worth mentioning that Swyftx lacks several features advanced traders might desire, such as derivatives, market depth and an order book. Swyftx no longer supports supports earn wallets. Their former feature allowed users to earn interest on 20 assets, where customers can lock up their tokens and passively earn returns of up to 65+%. Generally, the earning rates on offer were competitive for a centralised exchange. Although yields typically fluctuate, the APYs for assets like Kusama, Kava and Tron are above average. On the other hand, Ethereum and Solana have lower earning rates than if investors staked them on-chain. Demo modeis a fantastic initiative by Swyftx that allows beginners to practice trading cryptocurrency without risking any capital. Swyftx is one of few exchanges that offercrypto demo trading accounts. Switching to demo mode will provide each account with $10,000 in “mock” currency, which can then be used to build a virtual portfolio. Demo mode is a great way for newcomers to get used to the Swyftx platform, and for experienced investors to test new trading strategies. Swyftx offersnine different crypto bundlesfor customers to invest in. Bundles are a bit like exchange-traded funds (ETFs), being a curated basket of multiple digital currencies. Bundles are a great way to diversify your portfolio, as they are less exposed to the price swings of a single cryptocurrency. Bundles range from the simple “Big Two”, which contains only Bitcoin and Ethereum, to the “Staking Coin”, which is filled with ten assets that can all be staked via Swyftx Earn. Swyftx allows eligible Australians to add cryptocurrency to theirself-managed super fund (SMSF). This has become increasingly popular due to its tax benefits and the overall performance of cryptocurrency since its inception. Swyftx has partnered with crypto SMSF specialists New Brighton Capital to meet growing demand and address any regulatory risks. To comply with Australian policies, users must create a separate Swyftx account specifically for trading crypto within an SMSF. To be approved for this account, customers must supply supporting documentation including financial records. For a full list of SMSF requirements,refer to the ATO. Creating an SMSF can be a convoluted and confusing process, which is why Swyftx offers consultations with their experts. High-volume traders, institutions and SMSF accounts can buy and sell over 280+ cryptocurrencies over the counter (OTC). Swyftx’sOTCdesk supports trades of over $100,000 AUD and offers global liquidity and lower fees than other Australian competitors. Related:  Swyftx offers an affiliate program that more than 70,000 crypto investors have used. Customers with a valid Australian Business Number (ABN) will receive a commission for sharing promotional material and registering new users. Affiliates will receive 30% on all fees paid by new accounts that sign up with their unique referral link. Commissions are paid on the first week of every month. Swyftx allows its customers to automate investing through recurring orders, also known as dollar-cost averaging (DCA). DCA involves buying a certain amount of one — or multiple — cryptocurrency at regular intervals. This way, investors can ignore the short-term price fluctuations of an asset and continue accumulating. Recurring orders are a powerful way for beginners to build a long-term crypto portfolio while mitigating the risks of trying to time the market. Swyftx customers can set up DCA orders for all 310+ supported assets, as well as crypto bundles. One of Swyftx’s most compelling features is the platform’s ability to integrate with useful tax software. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has cracked down on tax reporting for crypto investors, so Swyftx can help its customers ensure they’re meeting all their obligations. Swyftx offers a free tax calculator. Using it is simple — customers just enter the value of disposed cryptocurrencies at the time of purchase and sale, as well as their taxable income. The calculator will then estimate the Capital Gains Tax owing come tax time. Alternatively,Swyftx can be easily integratedwith the popular tax reporting software Koinly and Crypto tax Calculator. Users can export a CSV file of their Swyftx trades for a specific timeframe and feed it into the Koinly software. That’s all there is to it — Koinly will then generate a tax report. Koinly can also connect directly to the Swyftx platform via an API key. Swyftx supports business and trust accounts for professional traders and other crypto-related service providers. Personal, SMSF and entity accounts can all be linked to a single login, making cycling through them quite convenient. Note: Users are required to create a personal account before they can open an entity account for their business or trust. Swyftx offers a clean and responsive smartphone application for Android and iOS devices. The app supports most of the main features found on the desktop platform, including trading cryptocurrency on the go, receiving price notifications and transferring assets to an earn wallet. The Swyftx mobile app has been generally well-received, with a 4.6/5 star rating and hundreds of thousands of downloads. As one would expect from a modern, reputable exchange, signing up for a new account on Swyftx is an incredibly simple process. To get started, navigate to the Swyftx platform’shome page. From here, customers can select either the white “Signup” button in the top-right corner, or the large orange “Sign Up Now” button in the middle of the page. Even if you wish to create an entity or SMSF account, you will need to start off by registering a personal account. Continue the signup process by entering your country of residence and email address. Once done, select “Next”. Swyftx will now send a 6-digit verification code to verify the email address entered in the previous step. Input the numbers to complete email verification. Next, enter your first and last name, along with a mobile number. Swyftx will then require you to enter another 6-digit code, this time verifying the mobile number provided. Finally, new accounts must pass Know Your Customer (KYC) verification before they can start depositing AUD and trading cryptocurrency on the Swyftx platform. This is due to the Australian government’s AML and CTF policies. To pass this process, you must have access to some form of government-issued identification, such as a driver’s license, passport or identity card. Take a photo (using a smartphone to do this is advisable) and upload them to complete verification. Once verified, the account is registered and ready to begin trading cryptocurrencies! The verification process usually takes a couple of minutes. Although not a requirement, it is always recommended that new accounts enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) before doing anything else.
