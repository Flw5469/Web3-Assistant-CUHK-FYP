    "news_title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Solana? Which of These 3 Tokens Under $1 Could Be the Next SOL? - Brave New Coin",
    "news_content": "Solana's racing to $260 in 2021 attracts a lot of interest. For NFTs, DeFi, and dApps today, it is one of the best blockchains available. But given the price as of October 20, 2024—$158.54—many are wondering if investing in SOL is still smart.If Solana's best days are behind us, there are other interesting coins under $1 with enough growth potential to be the next SOL. Of these, Tron (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Rexas Finance (RXS) are particularly strong challengers. Let's investigate why RXS seems especially destined to be the next big thing. Although Cardano and Tron are strong contenders,Rexas Finance(RXS) is perhaps the most interesting of the three since it could outperform both in the next bull run. At $0.060, RXS is in its fourth presale stage and has already attracted major interest from both institutional and individual investors, having garnered over $4 million. Leading the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenizing industry, Rexas Finance could transform our investment in conventional assets, including real estate, commodities, and companies. Tokenizing these assets allows RXS to offer fractional ownership, enabling daily investors to purchase and sell bits of highly valuable assets via blockchain. This is significant as it creates new wealth-generating opportunities for institutional investors that were not possible years ago. With real estate alone valued at around $379 trillion worldwide, the real asset market is vast. Particularly as more investors want to diversify their portfolios with asset-backed tokens, Rexas Finance’s capacity to access this market offers it great potential for expansion. Rexas Finance also boasts a Token Builder that lets people and companies tokenize their assets. This makes it simple for businesses to use distributed strategies to get financing. Moreover, the Rexas Launchpad provides a stage for fresh blockchain initiatives to raise money, positioning RXS naturally within the decentralized financial network. Rexas Finance has chosen a public presale instead of relying on venture capital money. Instead of leaving the lion’s share of earnings to large institutional investors, this choice lets average investors enter early and benefit from the growth of the token. Early investors could see significant profits, as the token is predicted to grow six times in value upon its debut.  Long regarded as a slow and steady initiative with an eye toward long-term expansion rather than short-term gains is Cardano (ADA). With a large network of developers and researchers working on its proof-of-stake blockchain, Cardano is significantly more reasonably priced than Solana right now, at $0.3586.Cardano distinguishes itself with its methodical approach, whereby every improvement is thoroughly investigated and reviewed before being introduced. Although Cardano has potential, investors seeking quick profits may find its slower rate of development frustrating. Though the token is likely to rise, the speed might not approach Solana’s historical exponential increases. Still, Cardano is a safe choice for individuals willing to wait for the long-term gains its original method could yield. Another cryptocurrency gaining popularity for its emphasis on web decentralization and low-cost, high transaction speeds is Tron (TRX). For investors wishing to get in early on a product with proven value, Tron is still somewhat reasonably priced at about $0.1566.Well-known in the crypto scene, Tron emphasizes DeFi, content sharing, and gaming from a decentralizing standpoint. Still, its narrow emphasis and the controversies around Justin Sun, its founder, impede its development. Tron has shown its endurance in the market, but its possibilities of matching leading blockchains like Solana are yet unknown. The most noticeable resemblance between RXS and Solana is their shared emphasis on scalability and practical value. Rexas Finance is ready to disrupt the conventional banking sector through asset tokenization, much like Solana attracted a large following by addressing Ethereum’s scalability issues. Furthermore,Rexas Financeoffers the kind of upside potential Solana experienced in its early years, given its current price of $0.060. Analysts project a 10,000%+ increase in RXS, driving the token to $12 by 2025. Solana still has room to grow, but its large price rise has made it less appealing to those looking for exponential returns. Although both Cardano and Tron are outstanding projects, their slower rates of growth and market saturation limit their potential for 10x or 20x gains in the near term.In contrast, Rexas Finance (RXS) is a new, innovative project with a clear application case in real asset tokenization. For those who entered Solana early, the current presale price of $0.060 presents a prime opportunity for early investors to lock in potentially life-changing rewards. RXS, with its solid foundations and practical value, is well-positioned to be the next major altcoin capable of rivaling Solana’s ascent.
