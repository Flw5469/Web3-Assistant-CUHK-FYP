    "news_content": "NFTgatorsis dedicated to providing you with the most accurate, dependable, and unbiased content on a daily basis, from the weird and wonderful world of NFTs (non-fungible tokens),metaverseand Web3.We write for the NFT, metaverse and blockchain gaming communities, and people who are interested in Web3. These include investors, startup founders and employees, as well as industry players from established companies in the space. We’ll start by saying that we’re receiving dozens of story pitches a day and won’t be able to respond to all of them, so here’s a handy guide to getting yours picked up. What we typically publish and what we’re looking for: We cover funding news in the NFT, metaverse, blockchain gaming and Web3 categories with a raise of $4 million and above. For announcements below our minimum amount, your story must have a newsworthy hook, such as big name VCs, media personalities/public figures, well-known angels or entrepreneurs backing the project. It should also have an innovative and unique solution that the company is developing to solve particular problems in Web3.Examples: Partnership announcements must contain a newsworthy hook such as big name VCs, media personalities/public figures, well-known angels, entrepreneurs or companies involved. In your pitches, highlight how the partnerships could have the potential to make a big impact on the industry.Examples: As a rule of thumb, the product/game you’re announcing should be innovative with unique features or tech, reputable founders and developers, and a solid story that could potentially drive interest from mass media and lead to greater adoption to the industry. We get (literally) hundreds of “oh hey we have a new game coming up” with zero differentiation from existing games out there, or unique/newsworthy angle to the story. Don’t be another one of those. Examples: We’re not looking to interview those who sold an NFT on OpenSea and added the title “Entrepreneur” to their LinkedIn profiles.We would love to talk to people with experience, expertise and passion in what they’re building in Web3, their vision, and how they’re planning to solve a problem in the industry.Examples: We look out for pitches that answer these questions well: NFTgators aims to deliver the latest news to its readers before other media outlets do. If you can provide us with exclusive, accurate information, unique quotes or commentary that no other media outlets will have, you’ll increase the chances of having your story picked up. Do note thatthis does not mean we’ll cover every exclusive that comes our way. However, we’d like to maintain a relationship with you and collaborate on future stories.In a nutshell, we aim to: See you later, alligator.

    "news_content": "Quick take: Nitro Labs, the developers of scaling infrastructure platform Terminaannounceda $4 million seed round led by Lemniscap. The fundraising also attracted participation from Animoca Ventures, Borderless Capital, Finality Capital, Race Capital and No Limit Holdings, with undisclosed members from Solana Foundation, Jump Crypto and Spartan joining as angel investors. Nitro Labs founder Yiwen Gao toldThe Blockthe fundraising closed in the summer and was structured as a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) with a token warrant. Termina allows developers to easily deploy SVM networks (layer-2s) on the Solana blockchain. The platform can be used to deploy a variety of applications including blockchain gaming, trading, and decentralised Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs), Gao said, adding that more than 20 projects are already building on the Termina including apps native to the Solana blockchain and cross-chain apps. “Layer 2 and network extensions are essentially the same,” Gao said. “The main thing is that network extension is a Solana-specific term and is supposed to encompass a wider range of solutions and end goals than Layer 2. Our core belief is that network extensions can offer more than just increased transaction throughput. They’re powerful tools for experimentation, innovation and meeting diverse needs beyond simple scaling.” Termina is currently in the private alpha devnet phase and plans to launch its testnet later this year, with a mainnet and the Termina token scheduled to go live next year. Commenting on his company’s leading role in fundraising, Shaishav Todi, managing partner of Lemniscap, said in a statement: “Termina is scaling the SVM to enhance developer engagement, accelerate blockchain deployments and drive user growth.” Stay on top of things: Subscribe to our newsletter usingthis link– we won’t spam!

According to theannouncementon Thursday, the fund has already made preliminary investments in fiat infrastructure developer Monerium and the decentralised AI platform Naptha AI. The two companies join GnosisDAO’s portfolio of more than 60 companies including BlackRock-backed real-world asset tokenisation platform — Centrifuge, the intent-centric orchestration layer — Fabriq, the self-custodial wallet — Zeal and on-chain collaboration space — Fileverse, among others. Commenting on the announcement, Gnosis co-founder Stefan George said in a statement: “With GnosisVC, we’re not just investing; we’re architecting a future where blockchain isn’t just technology but a lifestyle.” Built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, the Gnosis Chain claims to have over 200,000 validators. Some of GnosisDAO’s early projects include building Ethereum-based applications and key infrastructure like on-chain smart account provider Safe and user CoW Protocol, an open-source and permissionless DEX aggregation protocol.

    "news_content": "Quick take: Nillion, a privacy-focused blockchain project using the concept of “blind computing” to ensure data is shared and stored securely on the blockchain has raised $25 million in a funding round led by Hack VC. The fundraising also attracted angel investors and contributors from leading Web3 companies including Arbitrum, Worldcoin and Sei, CoinDeskreported. The fundraising brings the total raised to $50 million, according to Cointelegraph. It previously reported a$20 million seed roundin December 2022, which attracted participation from SALT Fund, TPC Ventures, G1 Ventures, Truffle Ventures, Distributed Global, Everstake Capital and others. Nillion said in the announcement on Wednesday that it will use the fresh capital to expand “blind computing”, a concept that allows applications to cooperate and process data without having to reveal sensitive information. The company is targeting projects built at the intersection of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, where large amounts of data need to be shared and stored securely. Some of Nillion’s partners include leading blockchain networks NEAR, Aptos, Arbitrum, ZKPASS and Ritual. According todocumentationexplaining how Nillion secures data, the company leverages “privacy enhancing technologies” PETs, including multiparty computation (MPC) to “enable users to securely store high-value data on Nillion’s peer-to-peer network of nodes, and allow for computations to be executed on the masked data itself.” “This eliminates the traditional need to decrypt data ahead of computation, enhancing the high-value data’s security,” the document reads. The company says its network’s ability to enable data computation while still hidden unlocks new use cases like building “tooling for private predictive AI and secure storage and compute solutions for healthcare, passwords, and trading data.” “It is imperative that data has the upgraded rails to handle the growing needs of secure storage and computation in this brave new world,” Nillion said in its announcement.

    "news_content": "Quick take: Gelato, a Web3 cloud platform for building enterprise-grade rollups has secured an $11 million Series A round led by Hack VC. The fundraising also attracted participation from Animoca Brands, IOSG Ventures and Bloccelerate VC. The company plans to use the fresh capital to expand its team and service as it enhances support for more enterprise-grade rollups. Gelato allows startups to launch their own blockchains and has already onboarded Kraken’s newly unveiled blockchain Ink, which is scheduled for a mainnet launch in early 2025, The Blockreported. Ink follows an emerging trend of crypto exchange platforms that have decided to build their own blockchains, forming an interoperable superchain network powered by Optimism’s OP Stack. Coinabse was among the first to launch its own blockchain with Base and more recently, Uniswap’s UniChain and OKX’s X Layer are also part of the Superchain. Gelato aims to bring to decentralised applications what Amazon Web Services does to web2 service providers, enabling developers to build highly scalable Web3 apps and ecosystems with ease. Commenting on the fundraising, Hilmar Orth, founder of Gelato said: “The idea that a single blockchain can scale to support all future on-chain applications is outdated. Instead, we envision a future with millions of interconnected chains, each scaling their on-chain apps independently.” “Just like web2 server applications are deployed on AWS, web3 roll-up applications are deploying on Gelato,” he said. Hack VC Managing Partner Ed Roman commented: “We are excited to join this funding round. We believe rollups are essential for scaling web3, and we share Gelato’s vision of a future built on millions of rollups.” Stay on top of things: Subscribe to our newsletter usingthis link– we won’t spam!

    "news_title": "Midas Launches the mBTC Yield-Bearing Token for Bitcoin-Dominated Assets - NFTgators",
    "news_content": "Quick take: Midas, a crypto platform for real-world asset tokenisation has launched the mBTC yield-bearing token, which will pay out yield to holders in Bitcoin-dominated assets rather than fiat. According to theannouncementon Thursday, the platform will collaborate with institutional asset managers and lenders to generate a yield of 4% for investors. The Ethereum-based protocol will initially support the wBTC, the biggest wrapped Bitcoin product and Coinbase’s cbBTC. The company said its new mBTC product will be “open and permissionless” allowing integration with EVM-based DeFi products. The token will initially support yield farming on the decentralised lending protocol Morpho, before adding more DeFi products. Commenting on the announcement, the Midas team said in a statement: “This launch follows the broader trend of increasing Bitcoin utility in DeFi, as Midas seeks to expand access to institutional-quality products that empower crypto users.” Midas already offers two tokenisation products, the mTBILL and mBASIS tokens, which are not available in the U.S., and the mBTC will also only be offered to non-residents of the U.S. Midas said investor assets for the mBTC token will be held in a bankruptcy-remote Special Purpose Vehicle, with a third-party regulated administrator providing performance updates. In March, Midasraised $8.75 millionin a funding round co-led by BlockTower Capital, Framework Ventures and HV Capital, and with participation from Coinbase Ventures, GSR, Hack VC, Ledger, FJ Labs, Lattice Capital, and Theia Ventures. Earlier this month, the companyreceived approvalto expand its tokenised U.S. Treasury bills and yield-bearing trade products to retail investors in Liechtenstein, allowing it to offer the products to non-accredited investors in the EU economic zone.

    "news_content": "Quick take: Variational, a decentralised Finance Protocol built on the Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum has revealed it completed a $10.3 million seed funding round. The fundraising was led by Bain Capital Crypto and Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia India and Southeast Asia), with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, North Island Ventures and Hack VC. The fundraising closed over three years ago, with the company beginning operations initially as a market maker in January 2022. Variational has since pivoted to developing a decentralised finance platform for trading crypto derivatives. The platform is currently in the test network with the decision to announce the seed round now, deemed strategic ahead of the mainnet launch. Variational co-founder and CEO Lucas Schuermann toldThe Blockthe fundraising was structured as equity with 1:1 standard token warrants. Schuermann described Variational as a generalised peer-to-peer trading and settlement protocol, adding that it is not a decentralised exchange. “As active participants in crypto OTC trading, we saw a number of risks and inefficiencies in the manual nature of bilateral trading,” Schuermann said, reflecting the company’s early beginnings as a market maker. “We had a vision that any two people in the world should be able to seamlessly execute a customized derivatives contract using automated infrastructure.” The company already has two products built on its platform, Omni, a retail-focused platform for trading perpetual futures and Pro, a platform focused on institutional traders. The company plans to add more apps in the future, particularly those with yield-generation features and lending. Stay on top of things: Subscribe to our newsletter usingthis link– we won’t spam!

    "news_content": "Quick take: M^0, a decentralised infrastructure layer for the issuance of the $M stablecoin and Smart $M, its yield-bearing wrapped token has announced a collaboration with Wormhole to enhance its multichain presence and interoperability. M^0 will leverage the Wormhole Messaging and Native Token Transfer (NTT) infrastructure, to introduce official versions of $M and Smart $M on multiple blockchains. The integration will enable developers and DeFi users to seamlessly use $M and Smart $M across various blockchain networks. Designed to be neutral and self-custodial, the $M token is backed by real-world reserves like U.S. treasuries. According to M^0, the $M stablecoin’s interoperability and transparency make it a more programmable and less fragmented digital representation of the US dollar. “The integration with Wormhole enables us to bring $M anywhere where developers and users of digital dollar use cases are, delivering on our promise to make decentralized money more interoperable and less fragmented for users worldwide,” said Luca Prosperi, President of the M^0 Foundation. The companies plan to expand the collaboration including working on a custom validator for Wormhole’s NTT network, leveraging M^0’s internal validator network by allowing the interoperability platform to inherit the security of the M^0 protocol. Robinson Burkey at Wormhole commented: “Combining Wormhole’s cross-chain technology with M^0’s innovative stablecoin infrastructure unlocks new possibilities for scalable and interoperable stablecoin solutions that will drive the next wave of DeFi adoption.” In June, M^0raised $35 millionin a Series A round led by Bain Capital Crypto and with participation from Galaxy Ventures, Wintermute Ventures, GSR, Caladan and SCB 10X.

    "news_content": "Quick take: zkPass has closed a $12.5 million Series A round backed by dao5, Animoca Brands, Flow Traders, Amber Group, IOBC Capital, Signum Capital, MH Ventures and WAGMI Ventures. The fundraising was structured as a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) and brought the total raised to $15 million, following the company’s $2.5 million seed round announced in August 2023. zkPass is building a zero knowledge-powered data verification protocol that allows users to verify specific information without sharing actual data. Some of the applicable use cases for zk proof-based data verification protocols include verifying identity, financial records and driver information as recently reported in zkPass’s closest rivalOpacity Network’sannouncement earlier this week. The verified information can then be shared with various entities like lending platforms to issue loans or AI models for research. Commenting on the announcement, Bing Jiang co-founder and CTO of zkPass toldThe Block, “Right now, we have over two million proofs generated from 70+ web data sources. ZK-based technology is still at such an early stage that we believe the vast majority of opportunity lies ahead — not just for our firm, but for the industry as a whole.” zkPass plans to use some of the fresh capital to expand its team engineering, marketing and business development functions. Jiang said the new fundraising valued zkPass at $100 million. The company plans to launch its native token in the first quarter of 2025.

    "news_title": "Alien Base DEX on Base Expands Thanks to Record $11M TVL on V3 - NFTgators",
    "news_content": "Alien Base, a trading hub on the Base network, saw its total value locked (TVL) more than double in the past week. The value of all deposits in its pools has broken above the $24 million mark, reaching the highest level since August 2023, when it peaked at over $28 million, according to data fromDefiLlama. With this rapid growth, Alien has joined the top 20 largest dapps on Base, which now has a record TVL of $3.24 billion. Notably, the Base network’s overall TVL nearly doubled in the past month, as shown below. Alien Base has been building the Base trading hub for trading tokens, including meme coins, on-chain. The platform offers aggregated liquidity, limit orders, yield farming and more. Alien has two active dapp versions, v2 and v3. The TVL on v2 has increased to nearly $14 million, touching the highest level since September 2023. The more recent v3 has a record $10.9 million in TVL after surging by over 100% within a month, becoming the go-to Alien DEX app. Tokens with the largest deposits on v3 include USDC, WETH, EURC, USDBC, and ALB – Alien Base’s native token. USDC and WETH each account for roughly one-third of the total value deposited on v3. Their share has expanded during the last few days as Alien experienced record inflows at the end of October. Meanwhile, on October 30, trading volume on Alien Base reached its second-highest day on record, processing over $5.5 million in trades. October is also the platform’s best month on record in terms of monthly volume. Unlike Aerodrome or BaseSwap, which are dominated by Base meme coins, Alien Base focuses very much on stablecoins and its native token. The most traded pairs on the platform include EURC/USDC, ALB/WETH on both app versions, WETH/USDC, and ALB/USDbC. Stay on top of things: Subscribe to our newsletter usingthis link– we won’t spam!

    "news_title": "Magic Eden Adds Ecosystem Support for BeraChain and ApeChain - NFTgators",
    "news_content": "Quick take: Magic Eden, the leading non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, has added support for BeraChain and ApeChain blockchains. This brings the total number of blockchains supported by the NFT platform to nine, including Ethereum, Bitcoin Ordinals, Polygon, Solana and Arbitrum. Magic Eden is on a mission to expand that list to ten by the end of the year and is preparing to add support for layer-1 blockchain Monad once it launches its testnet. Theannouncementcomes just days after ApeChain, the layer-1 blockchain developed by Yuga Labs and powered by ApeCoin launched its mainnet. According to Sunday’s announcement, ApeChain went live with over 360,000 transactions and 1,204 deployed contracts, boosting the ApeCoin price to its highest level since April. The token has since retracted to $1.31 as of this writing falling more than 15% in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, BeraChain has three main tokens in its ecosystem: BEX, BGT and HONEY. The proof-of-liquidity blockchain secured $100 million in a Series B funding round announced in April. According to the Dune Analyticsdashboard by Sealaunch, Solana and Bitcoin are the leading blockchains in terms of transaction volume on the Magic Eden platform with 42.8% and 42%, respectively in October. Ethereum has dropped to third with just over 15%, while Polygon has less than 1%. Solana also continues to dominate the number of sales and the number of buyers with over 72% and nearly 68%, respectively.
