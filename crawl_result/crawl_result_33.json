    "news_title": "Nishad Singh, FTX’s ‘king of kindness,’ dodges prison for role in exchange’s $8bn fraud – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link  Nishad Singh, a soft-spoken former software engineer colleagues once called the “king of kindness,” was sentenced on Wednesday to time served for his role in the failure of FTX in November 2022. In September of that year, Singh, 29, was a top executive at the crypto exchange led by Sam Bankman-Fried when he learned it had stolen billions from its customers to plug a gaping hole at its sister company, Alameda Research, a crypto trading firm. Once valued at $32 billion, FTX’s collapse sent shock waves through an industry struggling to go mainstream and assuage the concerns of regulators worldwide. Singh, once FTX’s head of engineering, was among the key witnesses who testified at the trial of Bankman-Fried in October 2023. Singh pleaded guilty in 2023 to one count of wire fraud, three counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and one count of conspiracy to defraud the US by violating campaign finance laws. In a letter this month to US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, Singh’s lawyers highlighted their client’s “extraordinary” circumstances, which included his relatively limited role in the collapse of FTX and his “immediate and exemplary” cooperation with prosecutors. They asked that he be sentenced to time served, which means he wouldn’t spend more days behind bars. Kaplan was convinced by that argument. Reiterating his belief that the collapse of FTX was the greatest financial fraud in history, Kaplan told Singh he was “entirely persuaded ... that your involvement was much more limited than certainly Bankman-Fried and Ellison, that it came relatively late in the day.” “Your case is not the case that Ms. Ellison’s was,” Kaplan continued, referring to Caroline Ellison, CEO of FTX sister company Alameda Research and the star witness at Bankman-Fried’s trial. Ellison was sentenced in September to two years in prison. “She was involved from the beginning. She knew for years what was going on.” When Singhtook the standat Bankman-Fried’s five-week trial, the software engineer said he had long found the CEO’s lavish spending “embarrassing” and reeking of “excess and flashiness.” Companies within the FTX empire had spent hundreds of millions on venture investments, luxury real estate, celebrity endorsement deals, and political donations. Singh also detailed at the trial the moment he learned the true cost of Bankman-Fried’s shopping spree. In September 2022, Ellison and FTX Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang told Singh that Alameda had borrowed billions from FTX customers. He demanded a meeting with Bankman-Fried, according to his testimony. Standing on the balcony of their $35 million penthouse in the Bahamas, the CEO confirmed to Singh that FTX couldn’t immediately repay all its customers if they decided to withdraw their cash and crypto en masse. ‘I felt really betrayed that five years of blood, sweat, and tears ... turned out to be so evil.’ “I felt really betrayed that five years of blood, sweat, and tears from me and so many employees, driving towards something that I thought was a beautiful force for good, had turned out to be so evil,” Singh testified at Bankman-Fried’s trial. During the following two months, Singh redoubled efforts to get Bankman-Fried to trim the company’s expenses, according to his lawyers. Still, he never blew the whistle on him. Singh told the court he stayed at FTX because he was afraid his departure could precipitate the company’s demise. “It was a panicked, self-delusional, and ultimately criminal error in judgement,” his attorneys wrote in their letter to Kaplan. “Nishad knew that staying at FTX meant hiding the existence of the hole from customers, and that he would be taking otherwise routine steps that, in these circumstances, would perpetuate the fraud.” Raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, Singh was childhood friends with Bankman-Fried’s younger brother. He graduated from the University of California in Berkeley, majoring in electrical engineering and computer science. In late 2017, Singh joined Alameda, impressed by its employees’ commitment to “effective altruism,” a philosophy that encourages adherents to seek high-paying careers and donate substantial sums to charity and good works. Despite being an inexperienced programmer when he joined Alameda, he rose up the ranks. When FTX collapsed, Singh was the company’s head of engineering and its third largest shareholder. During this time, he was suicidal, his parents wrote in letters to Kaplan. Singh has since found full-time work as a software engineer outside the finance and crypto industries and become engaged to longtime girlfriend Claire Watanabe, according to letters from friends and family. Singh is the fourth former FTX executive to be sentenced this year. In March, KaplansentencedBankman-Fried to 25 years in prison for stealing $8 billion from customers of the exchange. Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX’s subsidiary in the Bahamas, wassentencedto more than seven years in May. Wang is scheduled to be sentenced on November 20. Update, October 30: This story was updated to clarify Nishad Singh’s sentence. Aleks Gilbert isDL News’ New York-based DeFi correspondent. You can reach him ataleks@dlnews.com.",

    "news_title": "Editorial Standards - DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link The great British newspaper editor C. P. Scott, who ran the Manchester Guardian for 57 years, put it best: “Comment is free, but facts are sacred.” Journalism is different from most other professions in that its core activity is to tell the truth. Doctors, farmers and architects, for example, are morally obliged to be honest about what they do; but that does not define their jobs - to treat sick patients, to produce food and to design buildings. Reporting verified facts - telling the public the truth - is what journalism is all about. We should remember that when paid political spokespersons try to persuade us that there are such things as alternative facts. This code of ethics is based on the work of the Ethical Journalism Initiative and respected media such as the BBC, the New York Times, the Guardian, Agence France-Presse and Reuters. It aims to help reporters and editors to do their work to the highest professional standards. There is a compelling commercial reason to respect the code. The most important asset of any news organisation is its reputation for integrity, for accurate, honest and unbiased reporting. Reputation is like an oak tree; it can take years to reach maturity, but it can be destroyed in a day. Every story which respects these principles can help to enhance our reputation. To ignore them may imperil it. Accuracy depends above all on reliable and multiple sources. Every story should be cross-checked with at least three different sources. Do not passively accept what you are told. Reporters should challenge sources to back up their statements and point out inconsistencies and inaccuracies in what is said. Whenever possible, sources should be named and their professional status made clear to show they speak with authority on the subject. Sources often request anonymity. Agree only if you are convinced that to reveal their identity would harm them. The source may be just as keen as you are to make the information public. Beware of being manipulated by sources who wish to avoid taking responsibility for what they say. If you agree to quote a confidential source, you have a duty to protect them and not knowingly put them at risk. You must be prepared to accept the possible legal consequences of refusing to disclose their identity. Bear in mind that your source might be under digital surveillance. If the source says that something is “off-the-record”, make sure that you agree precisely what that means (see Interviews below). Sources must be quoted accurately and in context. You should provide as much background information as necessary for a reader to understand the story. Do not manipulate quotes or change the sense when editing. Avoid ellipses and partial quotes. Do not correct grammatical mistakes or “polish up” the language. Treat claims of breakthroughs and superlatives such as first, biggest, best and worst, with the scepticism they deserve. Be careful about striking up a relationship with a source on social media. To be identified as someone’s “friend” might raise questions about your impartiality. Analytical stories play an important part in covering financial markets. Readers want to know not only what happened but why. To give them as broad a picture as possible, several sources should be quoted. The sources must always be named. However authoritative, analysis - like other kinds of commentary - is opinion, and an anonymous opinion is worth nothing. We should not report rumours. But a rumour which moves financial markets, itself becomes part of a news story. When reporting the market reaction, we must be careful not to appear to endorse the rumour. Otherwise we are liable to be accused of market manipulation. We should check what appear to be newsworthy rumours, such as a takeover bid, but special care should be taken to source them reliably. Market sources who confirm rumours may be liable to regulatory or legal action when journalists are not. We must protect the identity of sources who require anonymity but treat their information with appropriate caution. It is important to agree the ground rules with the interviewee. It is best to do this in advance and not at the last minute as you are about to start. There is no universally accepted definition of what is meant by expressions such as off-the-record and deep background. It is essential for both sides to be clear which statements may be quoted in direct speech or otherwise attributed to the interviewee. We should make clear to our readers how, where and when the interview took place. Was it face-to-face or conducted electronically? If the latter, we must say whether by telephone, Skype call, e-mail or other means. A French television journalist once edited footage of a news conference with the Cuban leader Fidel Castro to make it look like an exclusive interview. For The Llama News, such behaviour is a sackable offence. We must say whether the questions were submitted in advance, and make clear whether the interviewee spoke in English or through an interpreter. An interviewee should never be allowed to vet the story. But the reporter may seek clarification of factual points or unclear quotes. Journalists working for The Llama News must seek the approval of the editor in chief before agreeing to be interviewed by other news media. They should accept interview requests only from respected outlets. When interviewed, identify yourself as a The Llama News employee. Journalists working for The Llama News who use social media on a professional basis should clearly identify themselves. Any breaking news should be reported first to The Llama News. We must not scoop ourselves on social networks. Journalists have a responsibility not to spread rumours on social networks. A journalist who wishes to use social media in a private context, such as a blog, should open a separate account and not refer The Llama News. Reporters should try to contact everyone concerned in a story so as to take contrasting opinions into account. We should give people the opportunity to comment if they are criticised or accused of wrongdoing. Allow them reasonable time to respond. A single unanswered phone call or email is not enough. If we cannot reach the person before we publish the story, we should say so and keep trying to contact them to update the story. But we are not obliged to give space to those who peddle fake news, conspiracy theories, defamatory remarks, hate speech, incitements to violence or propaganda. While we take complaints seriously and will answer them whenever possible, there is no automatic right of reply. Nor are we required to quote views that contradict established facts. Errors must be corrected quickly and transparently. There is no time limit on corrections. Factual errors must be corrected, days or even weeks later. Substantive errors should be drawn to the attention of our readers with a note to explain what was changed. In the case of a major error, it might be necessary to kill the story and delete it from the database. We must also be transparent with datelines and use them only when we have a staff reporter there. Otherwise, we imply that someone is available to reply to questions on the spot. Material received as handouts from governments or press services should be identified as such and not presented as original work. Reporters must always try to obtain information by fair means. In particular, they should identify themselves as journalists and not pretend to be someone else. In a free society the media has a responsibility to expose wrong-doing and hold government officials and other powerful people to account. Some undercover journalists have done remarkable work and even helped bring about changes to the law. They, however, are the shining exceptions to the rule that subterfuge is justified only in the most extreme circumstances. Those are when the story is in the public interest, and when the information could not reasonably have been obtained by other means. There is an important difference between what is in the public interest and what is of interest to the public. One includes fighting corruption and exposing lies told by a government minister; the other might be details of a Hollywood divorce. Undercover methods include video-taping someone or making a voice recording without their knowledge. Such techniques are permissible only to follow a lead in a story that is in the public interest. They should never be used to “fish” for information that might come up. If you believe that a story is so important, and the information so difficult to obtain, that you have no alternative, you must seek the approval of the editor in chief before resorting to undercover methods. It is not just your reputation as an individual journalist that is at stake. One of Britain’s best-known tabloid newspapers, The News of the World, was forced to close in 2011 after it published information obtained by an investigator who hacked the voicemail on the mobile phone of a murdered teenager. The use of drones to gather information is likely to become more frequent but is still illegal in some countries. The approval of the editor-in-chief and The Llama News’s legal department is necessary. Plagiarism is theft and is a sackable offence. So are making up stories, fabricating quotes and intentional defamation. No journalist should ever use his or her position for financial gain or other benefit. That is especially true of those covering money markets. Reporters or editors working on stories about companies in which they have a financial or other interest must declare that to the editor in chief. To avoid any suspicion of conflict of interest, another journalist will usually be assigned to the job. Make sure that you fully understand the laws and regulations concerning insider trading in the country where you work. Journalists have a responsibility to report corporate earnings fairly and accurately. Beware of company spin such as “pro-forma” results which might be intended to disguise poor performance. Always maintain a neutral tone so as not to appear to be giving an endorsement to a company or its products. In an ideal world, journalists would never pay for information. We do not live in an ideal world. But we must never do anything that would bring ourselves as individual journalists, or The Llama News, or the profession as a whole, into disrepute. Under no circumstances should a journalist accept money or anything with a monetary value in return for placing a story or for reporting in a way that favours the source. Contacts should never receive preferential treatment for their hospitality, nor be led to expect it. Journalists should be wary of accepting cash, tickets or any form of token or coupon with a monetary value from a source. Before accepting non-monetary gifts such as travel, accommodation and entertainment, journalists should consult the editor in chief so The Llama News can offer to contribute towards the costs. Similarly, reporters should offer to pay when sharing a drink or a meal with a contact. Journalists should never receive gifts or promotional material at their home address. Any goods lent for the purpose of testing them, such as electronic devices or cars should be returned promptly. The first question with every UGC photo or video is: who owns the content and who created it? Violating the copyright of a photo or video can have extremely serious consequences. Written permission must be obtained from the owner of the content to use, distribute and archive the content. We must confirm the authenticity of any uploaded material before redistributing it. We must never post material with the caveat that “the authenticity of this content could not be immediately verified”. Verification of the image and its ownership includes the following: Location: Does the image show the location that the source claims it does? Time: Does the video or photo correspond to the date and time claimed? Source: Is the source’s identity and authorship confirmed? Publication: Has the photo or video been published or is it exclusive? Copyright: Is the image protected and if so what are the legal terms? The Verification Handbook provides clear and concise media industry standards and practices on handling User Generated Content in multiple languages.http://verificationhandbook.com/ It is important to deal as fairly and transparently with sources on social media as with any other source. Approved media industry standards were drawn up by the Eyewitness Media Hub after the coverage of the attacks in Paris in January 2015. There are six key principles: Consider the physical and emotional welfare of eyewitnesses. Ensure that nobody is tempted to take risks in order to secure images. Be transparent; explain where and when the content will be used. Think of the intent of eyewitness when uploading content. Consider the impact on any person identifiable in the video or photo. Ask how an eyewitness wants to be credited. Work to make sure they feel fairly treated. The full checklist can be found at the website of the Eyewitness Media Hub, which publishes regular reports on the use of UGC in the news media.http://eyewitnessmediahub.com/resources/guiding-principles-for-handling-eyewitness-mediaThe Llama News will pay for authentic content produced by eyewitnesses if the news value justifies it. Some investors in crypto currencies have lost large amounts of money and suffered as a result. Journalists should show sensitivity and compassion when interviewing such people and remember that dealing with the media can be a source of additional distress for them. We should avoid intruding into people’s private lives unless they indicate a willingness to talk. We should seek permission, preferably in writing, from a parent, guardian, teacher or other responsible individual before speaking to, photographing or filming children. Special care is required in reporting extreme cases involving death. The reporter must ensure that the death has been confirmed by the family or another person authorised to speak for them. We must not report suicide as a likely cause of death unless it has been formally confirmed. Distress can lead to anger or resentment, and reporters must be wary of quoting potentially defamatory statement. Repeating what someone else has said is no legal protection from being sued for defamation.

    "news_title": "Stripe’s Bridge buy a sign that crypto’s new competitors — and partners — are big fintechs, says Gemini’s EU head – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Stripe has turned up the heat in crypto. The payment giant’s$1.1 billionacquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge heralds the next stage of crypto’s evolution, which will pit native brands against fintechs, banks, and asset managers. That’s according to Gillian Lynch, head of Ireland and EU for Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’s crypto exchange Gemini, who argues the evolution is already palpable in the European Union. “If I look at my competitors here in the EU, the fintechs are huge competitors, which is probably slightly different from how it is in the States” where crypto natives like Coinbase and Kraken loom larger, Lynch said. The fintechs are just the beginning, she said, with the big banks next as the EU rolls out regulation that will help large global players enter the market. The EU’s Markets in Crypto- Assets regulation went live in July, with stablecoin rules first. The parts of the regulation covering service providers like exchanges will kick in at the end of December. Complying with MiCA’s licencing rules has been “a mammoth task” for Gemini, Lynch said, but that could prove a boon to well-funded companies. MiCA allows firms that set up operations in one jurisdiction to offer their services to the entire bloc. So those who can afford compliance with the onerous rules can enter the world’s second largest crypto market, accountingfor one-fifth of global volume. Businesspeople at EU crypto exchanges, including Lynch, predict consolidation will ramp up as a result. Larger firms will come into the market, with smaller ones that can’t afford to comply either folding or being bought up. It’s no coincidence that MiCA’s first stage takes aim at stablecoins, and the first landmark deal — Stripe’s — is to integrate with stablecoin capabilities. That’s seen as an early sign that crypto is gaining mainstream acceptance, being integrated into the financial system, and moving beyond its early use as a store of value, Lynch noted. “We’ve focused a lot on the investment side [of cryptocurrencies], but we will start to see a lot more focus on crypto as a means of payment, and that’s where stablecoins come into play,” she said. Large, well-funded players muscling in on the market is a competitive threat to crypto natives — but it also offers opportunities to partner with them also. Gemini has emerged from a difficult period in the US. In February, the company paid a $3.7 million fine and returned some $1.1 billion to customers of its defunct lending programme, Earn. The exchange wants to grow the institutional side of its business, Lynch said. Gemini will look to partner with firms on a range of activities. Asset managers will need somewhere to store the crypto they hold and offer to investors, while some banks may need a partner for over-the-counter trading. Gemini is also interested in targeting private wealth — the services banks provide to high net worth individuals, Lynch said. That makes sense for a firm headquartered in the tax haven of Ireland, the world’s third biggest hub for investment funds. As banks will want to provide customers with access to crypto and MiCA providing clear guidance for digital assets in the EU, the stage looks set for this iteration of crypto’s evolution. “It’s going to be fascinating to see that play out over the next 12 to 24 months,” Lynch said.

    "news_title": "Three factors driving Bitcoin’s $71,000 rally and what analysts say will happen next – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Bitcoin continues to rally as investors pile into the $1.4 trillion cryptocurrency. It’s just 3% away from a new record after Bitcoin hit $71,500 on Tuesday morning. Analysts say more fireworks are coming. Carlos Guzman, an analyst with crypto market-making firm GSR, toldDL Newsthat three “positive drivers” are behind the latest move. First is sentiment around the upcoming US elections, specifically the likelihood of Donald Trump’s victory. “A Trump win would have a greater positive impact on prices in the short term given his campaign promises,” said Guzman. “And with sentiment around his campaign near all-time highs, as reflected by prediction markets, crypto prices are reacting positively.” Between him and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump has emerged as the better crypto candidate as voters head to the polls next Tuesday. In May, hetoldan audience at his Mar-a-Lago residence that “if you’re in favour of crypto, you’d better vote for Trump” and announced his campaign would accept crypto donations. Harris has been relatively quieter. In September, shesaidher administration would boost America’s competitiveness and partner with companies to “encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets.” Second, said Guzman, is any easing of tensions in the Middle East. “Israel’s limited retaliation against Iran late last week, and the latter’s remarks that it doesn’t want a wider war, possibly assuaged market concerns,” he said. Investors fled risky assets like cryptocurrencies asIran fired missiles at Israel, threatening to turn the regional conflict into an all-out war. Israel responded on October 25 by striking Iranian military targets in Iran. “This should be the end of this tit-for-tat,” Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, deputy Pentagon press secretary,toldreporters on Monday. Third, investor inflows into spot exchange-traded crypto funds have been especially bullish of late. “Bitcoin ETFs yesterday recorded the highest net inflows of the past two weeks, potentially further fueling the positive market response we saw overnight,” said Guzman. In the past two weeks, Bitcoin ETFs alone have raked in $3 billion,accordingto Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise. “The end-of-year stretch is going to be wild,” Hougan said on X.

    "news_title": "UK capital gains hike seen as missed opportunity to boost crypto industry  – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Crypto industry representatives said Labour’s decision to hike the top capital gains tax to 24% will increase the burden on small business and investors. “We’re disappointed that the Chancellor did not take this opportunity to align digital-asset taxation with traditional transactions, and also failed to give the industry further clarity on the tax regime, leaving many startups, scale-ups, and investors in limbo,” a CryptoUK spokesperson toldDL News. The hike in capital gains tax — a levy on profits made from an investment — was announced on Wednesday as part of the Labour government’s first budget. It’s one way Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves wants to plug what she has called a £22 billion black hole in public spending left by the Conservative government. Reeves’s budget raises the capital gains regime’s lower rate from 10% to 18%, and its top rate from 20% to 24% Reeves noted that the UK still has a lower tax rate than any European G7 economy, and indeed the raise was more modest than the UK business community had feared. The country’s tech scene had warned that a steep rise could scare small businesses away from Blighty. Many startups compensate their workers in shares of the company, which are taxed for capital gains. Still, Jack Land, head of UK growth at startup MetaWealth, toldDL Newsthat even the uptick of the top rate to 24% risks a brain drain. Entrepreneurs are now “facing diminished rewards, making the UK less competitive” compared to tax and innovation-friendly global hubs, Land said. “This policy shift could lead to damaging talent and capital flight risk.” CryptoUK had warned Reeves that this negative scenario was true also for the UK’s digital-assets businesses. Crypto is primarily taxed under the capital gains regime, and CryptoUK wants tax policy to be more in line with other kinds of assets. For example, UK crypto investors can’t put their assets into tax wrappers like ISA accounts as they can with stocks and bonds. Certain decentralised lending transactions are taxed, whereas the same transactions in the traditional space are not. Aligning digital assets and traditional assets “would have ensured fairness between the sectors and helped to reduce administrative burdens on businesses, while encouraging more participation in the digital economy,” CryptoUK said. “The digital-assets industry has an important role to support economic growth and job creation in the UK, but this needs to be done on a level playing field.” Land agreed with the premise that the move amounted to a missed opportunity for the UK to promote the blockchain sector. “The UK should be looking at blockchain technology — like stablecoins and tokenised real-world assets — as essential tools for modernising the economy, not barriers to growth.” Reach out to the author at joanna@dlnews.com.",

    "news_title": "How Crypto.com leapfrogged Coinbase with record $139bn volume: ‘We’ve got the biggest traders’ – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Crypto.com is set to register $139 billion worth of trades in October, its best monthly performance. The Singapore-based exchange, founded in 2016, is now the world’s second-biggest crypto trading platform by volume, perdatacompiled byThe Block. It has outpaced both Dubai-based Bybit and US exchange giant Coinbase in recent months. A large part of Crypto.com’s volume surge is thanks to its courting of institutional clients, George Tucker, a general manager at Crypto.com, toldDL News. “We attracted traders who have immense trade frequency, and our liquidity supports their demand,” Tucker said. These clients, Tucker said, chose the exchange over others because it enables them to capitalise on market inefficiencies at scale. Crypto.com’s trading volume has grown rapidly this year. In January it handled just $37 billion in trades compared to rival Coinbase’s $75 billion. Now that situation has reversed with Crypto.com’s $139 billion October volume more than double Coinbase’s $57 billion. Still, Crypto.com’s record figure pales in comparison to top crypto exchange Binance’s $706 billion October figure. Crypto.com’s sudden rise in the second half of the year has taken many by surprise. Despite handling more trading volume than Coinbase, it only has around10%of Coinbase’s monthly visitors, according to data from website traffic analysis platform Similarweb. On the Apple app store download rankings, a popular metric for gauging retail interest in crypto, Coinbase comes in as the308thmost popular free app, while Crypto.com is425th. These metrics also point to the bulk of Crypto.com trading volume coming from a smaller number of high-frequency traders and institutions, rather than retail participants. “It might be a simple case that we’ve got the biggest traders trading off our platform,” Tucker said, adding that the situation doesn’t mean the exchange’s increased trading volumes “rest in the hands of one or two traders.” Crypto.com says it operates in over 100 countries, the most of any crypto exchange. Its ability to pick up users from jurisdictions where other exchanges don’t operate may also be helping it grow. “Coinbase is very dominant in North America, but not as dominant in other markets where we’ve got representation,” Tucker said, adding that Southeast Asia is a very important market. According to Similarweb, only26%of Crypto.com’s web traffic comes from the US, compared to65%of Coinbase’s. The favourable crypto market conditions are helping. “In the last six months, in particular, we’ve seen a significant uptick that coincided with more activity in the market,” Tucker said. Bitcoin has soared 109% over the past year, fuelled by the launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, Chinese government stimulus, and the expectation of further interest rate cuts in the US.

    "news_title": "Where are businesses like Binance setting up shop in the emerging crypto centre of Dubai? – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Dubai’s crypto scene is pumping. In the 12 months ending in June, investors sent $34 billion in crypto transfers to the United Arab Emirates, which doesn’t levy income tax, according to data from Chainalysis. That’s an almost 42% increase from the prior period. Dubai, the biggest city in the UAE, has its own digital assets regulator, regularly hosts crypto conferences, and is home to some of the industry’s biggest names, including Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s former CEO, who was recently released from a US prison. As Asian marketsscrambleto establish regulatory regimes around crypto and the US girds for changes in the White House and Congress, the Persian Gulf nation has emerged as a stable centre for the industry. Here’s an inside look at how Dubai’s crypto scene works: The UAE’s crypto regulatory system is akin to a Russian nesting doll. The country’s federal government has its own central bank as well as securities and commodities agency, both of which regulate crypto. Inside the federal government lies the UAE’s seven emirates, which are like provinces or states. Dubai, an emirate in its own right, has its own crypto regulator: the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority — or VARA, as it’s commonly known. And the city has a suite of free zones, or geographic locales generally designed to attract specific industries. One of these is the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, or DMCC. Established in 2002, the free zone caters toward companies that deal in commodities, or goods like gold, tobacco, and coffee. Since then, the DMCC has expanded to property development and helped plan two districts in southern Dubai. It’s also planted its flag in tech and tried to entice AI and crypto developers to set up shop in the free zone. Over 600 crypto companies have registered with the DMCC since 2021, according to Belal Jassoma, the free zone’s director of ecosystems. The DMCC's Crypto Centre has a co-working space and resides in an 81-story skyscraper. Photo: Ben Weiss/DL News The DMCC’s Crypto Centre resides in a futuristic, 81-story skyscraper in southern Dubai, where a roving, kiosk-on-wheels helps check in visitors. Crypto Centre members receive a co-working desk, qualify for UAE residency visas, and become eligible for various crypto licences, among other benefits. “[The DMCC] has a pretty, I’d say, thriving crypto ecosystem,” Arushi Goel, Chainalysis’ policy lead in the Middle East and Africa, toldDL News. Almost 30 kilometres, or 19 miles, north of the DMCC’s headquarters lies the Dubai International Financial Centre, or DIFC. Another free zone, it’s a winding complex of interconnected buildings and skyscrapers. Along one stretch lies a suite of office spaces inhabited by crypto firms, and outside stands a mural that is, of course, also an NFT. Founded in 2004, the DIFC caters towards companies in finance. Firms in the DIFC answer to the free zone’s own financial regulatory authority, whose legal system is modelled after English common law. Other international hubs for finance, like Singapore and Hong Kong, have similarly structured their legal systems off of the UK’s regime. Amrita Sethi, an artist in the UAE, designed the DIFC's NFT mural. Photo: Ben Weiss/DL News “It’s much easier for businesses who come from outside — foreign businesses — for them to adapt,” Goel said, in reference to why companies would choose to set up shop in the DIFC. Financial giants like Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, and even crypto stalwart Ripple have outposts in the DIFC. Smaller crypto companies like Crypto Oasis, a Dubai blockchain accelerator, also have offices in the free zone. “We want to be positioned closely to these entities, because, at the end of the day, a lot of the solutions that are being built in the space are targeted at these types of companies,” Saed Ereiqat, ecosystem manager at Crypto Oasis, toldDL News. One stop north of the DIFC on Dubai’s metro lies One Central. It’s an office complex that houses one of the biggest names in crypto: Binance. In late 2023, Binance moved into the campus. The crypto exchange has approximately 600 employees in the UAE, according to Vishal Sacheendran, its head of regional markets. Not far from One Central stands Dubai's Museum of the Future, which features an exhibition on space travel, among other topics. Photo: Ben Weiss/DL News Binance’s fifth-floor office is a cross between a Silicon Valley startup and a traditional finance firm. There’s an imposing welcome desk in the entrance, but nearby lies a games room and bean bag chairs. On one wall, a Binance-branded skateboard is on display. Binance isn’t the only exchange in One Central. Bybit also has a large office, which sports a Bybit-branded Formula One car. Crypto analytics heavyweight Chainalysis also recently opened an office in the complex. Why is One Central such a mecca for crypto? Partly because of its proximity to VARA. The regulator, established in 2022, is the world’s only agency solely dedicated to the oversight of digital assets, said Chainalysis’ Goel. “You want to work with a regulator that’s willing to listen to you,” said Sacheendran. For the Binance executive, it’s obvious why his exchange and other crypto companies have set up shop an approximately 15-minute walk from VARA. “What are the advantages of always having your regulator on speed dial?” he said. “If there’s something that you guys want to discuss, we always jump on a call. But if there’s something that makes better sense meeting in person, it’s easy.” Ben Weiss isDL News’ Dubai Correspondent. Got a tip? Email him atbweiss@dlnews.com. Correction, October30: A previous version of this article misstated the floor on which Binance has its office. It’s on the fifth, not the eighth floor.",

    "news_title": "Why Bitcoin is ‘shaping up for one monster rally’: Five signs the price is about to skyrocket – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Bitcoin is on the cusp of hitting a new all-time high. That’s the conclusion of market watchers who predict that the price will skyrocket between$80,000and$125,000by the end of 2024. A mixture of macroeconomic factors will drive the world’s leading cryptocurrency to new heights, they say. “We’re shaping up for one monster rally into year-end and beyond,” David Brickell, head of international distribution at FRNT Financial, and former forex trader Chris Mills wrote in theirblogon Monday. So what are the factors expected to influence the price? US voters will choose between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris next week. Their choice will set the tone for the next four years when it comes to everything from abortion to inflation. It will also determine how high Bitcoin will soar, according to several analysts. Their predictions consider that Trump has come out as a staunch supporter of the crypto industry while Harris has been more cautious in her support. In September, Bernstein analysts predicted that Bitcoin’s price would surge to$90,000this year if Trump grabs the Oval Office, but it would fall as low as $30,000 if Harris is elected. Last week, Standard Chartered said Bitcoin’s price will soar to $75,000 this year if Harris wins and up to $125,000 if Trump wins. China could also play a role in determining Bitcoin’s future. Last month, China announced amassive $284 billion stimulus packagein an aggressive bid to spur economic growth. Nikolay Karpenko, director at institutional crypto liquidity provider B2C2, said China’s economic policies can have a notable effect on global liquidity conditions. Crypto thrives in an excess of liquidity as seen during the quantitative easing of the Covid-era. Investors have looked to China’s aggressive economic stimulus package plans as a reason to be optimistic about Bitcoin. “If Beijing announces more aggressive fiscal measures, particularly with regard to infrastructure and liquidity support, we could see renewed upside pressure on Bitcoin, as it benefits from increased risk appetite,” Karpenko toldDL News. Karpenko also said interest from big money players in Bitcoin via exchange-traded funds and futures will push prices higher. Record inflows in the space will be crucial to sustain “the current bullish momentum,” Karpenko toldDL News. Bitcoin ETF inflows in the US have topped $3 billion in the last two weeks, according to data from UK crypto fund Farside Investors. That massive investment inflow has driven the cumulative US spot Bitcoin ETF flow to $22 billion since the SEC approved the investment vehicles in January. Whale activity is also on the rise, according to CEX.io market research analyst Illya Otychenko. The exchange defined whales as investors who own a significant amount of crypto, in this case 1,000 Bitcoin. Otychenko says the number of whale accounts is hitting levels not seen since 2021. That matters because the last time those numbers rose, it “preceded bullish rallies” in 2016 and 2020, he wrote. Otychenko has noted a sharp spike in leverage ratios for Bitcoin futures, reaching levels not seen since August 2023. Leverage ratios in futures trading indicate the level of exposure of a trader’s position. It measures how much a user’s trade size is magnified compared to the underlying margin collateral deposited with the broker. Large leverage ratios indicate speculative optimism among users which corresponds to a growing risk appetite. CEX.io analysts, however, say the trend creates room for “sharp liquidation cascades.” Given Bitcoin’s volatility even during a bullish run-up, traders who bet with large leverage ratios risk massive liquidations.

    "news_title": "How one trader’s $26m Trump bet exposed Polymarket’s prediction problem – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link When a trader on Polymarketbet$26 million this autumn that Donald Trump will win the US election, crypto fans of the former president gushed with excitement. Unlike traditional polls, which show that Vice President Kamala Harris had a narrow advantage over her Republican rival, the Polymarket wager has helped propel Trump 32 points ahead. As Trump supporters revelled in the mojo and piggybacked on the whale-sized bet, political analysts scrambled to understand what was going on — did Polymarket bettors know something pollsters had missed? Harry Crane, a statistics professor at Rutgers University who specialises in prediction markets, gives two possibilities: “There’s a whale just buying up a bunch of shares, and the markets are moving irrationally,” he toldDL News. “Or there’s a smart bettor, and it’s buying up a bunch of shares, and the markets are moving rationally based on that person’s information.” In other words, who knows. One thing does appear certain — the Trump whale has cast doubt on Polymarket’s efficacy as forecaster. If one trader can skew a$2.6 billion election betso out of whack with other models, how useful are its predictions? “I don’t think the Poly price is necessarily accurate,” Douglas Campbell, an economics professor at the New Economic School and founder of Insight Prediction. ‘Betting markets will become more of the priority... not in four years, but in eight years.’ Polymarket did not respond to requests for comment. The whale’s impact is the latest turn in Polymarket’s rise from obscurity to the heart of the 2024 presidential election’s narrative. Ever since the crypto-powered prediction market surged to$4 billionin total cumulative volume, it’s been featured on Bloomberg’s trading terminals,CNN, andCNBC. “Studies show prediction markets are more accurate than polls in predicting election results,”tweetedWill LeGate, a growth lead at Polymarket, on Friday. (He later deleted the tweet.) Until now, most soothsaying in the quadrennial presidential cycle has come from national polling firms and news organisations that have spent decades honing their methods for divining voters’ intentions. Yet the notion that Polymarket is manifesting the wisdom of the marketplace — an idea known as the efficient market hypothesis — has galvanised the entire prediction market sector. “Polling is still a huge piece of data that’s being used in these markets,” Crane said. “That being said, prediction markets will become more of the headline. Betting markets will become more of the priority. Not in four years, but definitely in eight years.” Founded in 2020 by Shayne Coplan, Polymarket enables punters to buy “yes” or “no” shares for various outcomes of events like sports matches, weather crises, and elections. The shares analogy is apt — as users buy up “yes” shares for an event’s outcome, their price rises and serves as de facto odds for the event. There’s a$244 million market, for instance, that asks: Who will win the Champions League this year? According to Polymarket, Manchester City, the English football club, has a 22% chance of winning. This means one “yes” share costs 22 cents. If they win the European title, that share will immediately shoot up to $1. If they don’t, that share drops to $0. The theory goes that if enough people bet on the market, especially clever sports analysts, the odds are a useful forecasting tool. ‘The idea from sharp bettors is you should probably just fade this guy.’ Polymarket’s use of stablecoins to facilitate transactions also catered to a ready-made audience: the tens of millions of holders of Bitcoin and other digital assets. In October, Polymarket shook up the election story when four accounts —Fredi9999,Princess Caro,Michie, andTheo4— started amassing huge “yes” votes on Trump. Last week, Polymarket said the four accounts were actually controlled by one French trader, according aa reportinThe New York Times. Right now, one “yes” share for Trump to win costs 66 cents, giving the former president 66% odds of winning. Compared to various national polls, that’s a huge discrepancy. Polling platform FiveThirtyEight gives Harris a1.4%lead. Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight andnow an advisor to Polymarket, also gives Harris a1.2%lead. Of the four whale accounts, Fredi999 has been the biggest player and has steadily placed bets since October 7, according to blockchain data platformPolygon Scan. Polymarket is built on the Polygon network. A big part of the problem at Polymarket is its lack of liquidity. Polymarket may have hosted $4 billion in volume cumulatively, but that also includes closed trades. There is far less in daily open trades. Just over$300 millionin open orders exist across the entire platform, including markets unrelated to the elections. This is a lot, but when one trader makes up more than 10% of all those orders in one direction, it distorts the market. This is because Polymarket operates as an order book exchange. People buy shares from sellers. If there are more buy orders than sell orders, the price of the shares will rise until the next available sell order is found. Though there are more than178,000 monthly active users, the vast majority of orders arefor less than $500. This dynamic can create extreme market moves, like reducing the wisdom of the crowds to just one French trader. On October 25, for example, another Polymarketuser bought $3 millionworth of “yes” shares for Trump winning the election. Because there were so few sell orders to match his purchase, the price of “yes” shares briefly spiked to 99 cents, pushing Trump’s chance of winning to 99%. A wallet moved $3,000,000 to Polymarket today and put it all immediately on \"YES\" for Trump.His only issue: he cleared the whole order book and bought $274,300 worth of shares at 99.7%.pic.twitter.com/GA2hlbKgqq A wallet moved $3,000,000 to Polymarket today and put it all immediately on \"YES\" for Trump.His only issue: he cleared the whole order book and bought $274,300 worth of shares at 99.7%.pic.twitter.com/GA2hlbKgqq When asked if Polymarket was efficient at predicting odds, Campbell toldDL Newsthere are still issues. He says it’s enough to take his chances and bet against Polymarket’s mega whale. “The idea from sharp bettors is you should probably just fade this guy. He doesn’t know what he’s doing,” Campbell said, referring to Fredi9999. Crane disagrees. There’s no reason someone with that much money shouldn’t have access to better information, he toldDL News. “When someone with big money makes a big move, it is because they know something nobody else knows.” Liam Kelly isDL NewsBerlin-based DeFi Correspondent.

    "news_title": "Why Ethereum is down 7% while Bitcoin’s price is gaining  – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link The world’s two largest cryptocurrencies usually rise and fall in tandem. However, over the past week, Ether has dropped 7% to $2,525 and Bitcoin has stayed relatively flat at $68,957, according to CoinGecko. “While ETH has at times outperformed BTC, this cycle we have seen nothing of the sort,” Ben Caselin, chief marketing officer at the crypto exchange VALR, toldDL News. Bitcoin and Solana’s skyrocketing prices have been bolstered by the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the ongoing memecoin frenzy. And the recent discrepancy between Bitcoin and Ethereum continues a decoupling that occurred afterEthereum ETFswent live in July. Since then, Ether has declined 36%, whereas Bitcoin has increased 2%. While many celebrated the long-awaited launch of the financial instruments, which allow retail investors to buy and sell Ether through brokerage accounts, the ETFs haven’t seen nearly the same inflows as spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since July, spot Ether ETFs have seen a net outflow of more than $504 million, according to data from SoSo Value. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen a total inflow of almost $22 billion since their launch in January. “Regulators and traditional investors are showing more openness to BTC, but not quite the same for ETH — at least, not yet,” Shauli Rejwan, managing partner atMasterkey.VC, toldDL News. Ether’s recent losses mirror the rise of other layer 1 protocols like Solana, whose cryptocurrency is up almost 7% over the past seven days, Caselin said. “There is no guarantee that Ethereum will have long-lasting staying power at the top,” he added. However, he said, in the coming weeks, Ethereum’s price may rise. “The upcoming US elections might bring volatility back to the market, which may bode well for Ethereum over the short-term, but such events can also serve for exit liquidity,” he said. Rejwan struck a more optimistic note. Given how recently spot Ether ETFs launched, he said it’s still too early to count the cryptocurrency out. “We’ll start seeing Wall Street interest materialise in roughly six to 10 months,” he said, “or maybe the bull run will accelerate their decision.”",

    "news_title": "DWF fires partner over drugging allegations in Hong Kong – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Crypto trading firm DWF Labs fired a partner on Tuesday hours after a woman published a social mediapostaccusing one of drugging her during a recent business meeting in Hong Kong. “DWF Labs is aware of the recent and deeply concerning allegations involving one of our partners, who has been accused of inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour,” DWF said in astatementTuesday. “While the matter is under investigation, DWF Labs has decided to dismiss the said partner from management and operational roles effective immediately.” The statement did not identify the partner. But DWF hasremovedpartner Eugene Ng from its “team” webpage, according to areportfromThe Block. While Ng could not be found on DWF’s website Tuesday afternoon,DL Newscould not immediately confirm that he had been removed after the woman’s account of her ordeal in Hong Kong went viral hours earlier. LinkedIn and X accounts that belong to Ng appeared Tuesday afternoon to have been deleted or made private.DL Newswas able to find and view LinkedIn accounts that belong to other employees listed on the company’s “team” webpage. Ng and DWF did not immediately returnDL News’ request for comment. On Tuesday, X user “Hana” said she had told police in Hong Kong that a partner at DWF had spiked her drink during a meeting at a bar the evening of October 24. Hong Kong police did not immediately confirm that an investigation was underway. In her post, Hana shared a still image from security footage that purportedly shows the partner spiking her drink. Hana works in venture capital, according to the bio on her five-month-old X account. She did not immediately returnDL News’ request for comment. “He has previously approached me a couple of times offering me a job opportunity — a project he claimed was a perfect fit for my background,” she wrote on X. “As someone new to crypto, and eager to learn, I accepted his invitation.” During the meeting, Hana went to the bathroom, and took a couple sips of her drink when she returned, she wrote on X. When the partner stepped out to take a call, a waitress came over and told her that her drink had been spiked. “All I wanted to do was leave the situation but as I tried to step outside I felt extremely dizzy,” she wrote. “I can remember the disgust I felt when he kept saying: ‘come with me I have a suite at the Murray, and stay close with me I can give you more alpha, I can help you get to places.’” DWF said it will “continue to monitor the situation and stand in solidarity with individuals affected by such incidents, as we believe in justice and support for all.” It isn’t the first time the firm has been the subject of controversy. In May 9 report inThe Wall Street Journal, DWF wasidentifiedamong the firms accused of engaging in pump-and-dump schemes and market manipulation on crypto exchange Binance last year. A former Binance insider claimed Binance’s investigations team uncovered $300 million worth of wash trading from DWF Labs. Wash trading refers to simultaneously buying and selling the same asset to create a false impression of market activity. DWF Labs pushed back against the accusations. “It’s competitor-driven FUD,” Heng Yu Lee, a founding partner at DWF Labs, toldDL News, using the acronym for fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

    "news_title": "PayPal’s slumping crypto holdings signal what’s really driving Bitcoin’s $72,000 surge – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link The online payments company giant PayPal reported Tuesday a decrease in its crypto holdings, a sign that institutions are making up a bigger share of crypto traders. PayPal saw the amount of crypto it held on behalf of its customers drop almost 11% from the second to third quarter to about $2.17 billion, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The amount of Bitcoin it held, in dollars, decreased 1% from June 30 to September 30, even though the world’s largest cryptocurrency jumped 8% in price during the same period. Similarly, PayPal’s Ether holdings tanked 27%, which outstripped the cryptocurrency’s 22% price decline. In addition to Bitcoin and Ether, the fintech giant lets customers buy and sell Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and PayPal USD, the firm’s own stablecoin. PayPal reported that the dollar value it held of these three cryptocurrencies also dropped. CryptoQuant, a research firm, notes that institutional demand for Bitcoin has been rising. Over the past year, said founder and CEO Ki Young Ju, less than half of the Bitcoin flowing into US spot exchange-traded funds, which are about 80% retail, flowed into so-called whale wallets holding more than 1,000 Bitcoins. “In custodial wallets, institutional demand is twice that of retail,” at about 670,000 Bitcoins versus 278,000,he said on X. Since the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, almost $23.3 billion has flowed into the financial vehicles, according toSoSo Value. Spot Bitcoin ETFs let investors gain exposure to the cryptocurrency from traditional brokerage accounts. The total number of institutional investors who had positions in Bitcoin ETFs rose 14% between the first and second quarter this year, according to anAugust notefrom Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of Bitwise. “The institutions are coming, and they’re coming in size,” he wrote. In contrast, the retail market’s appetite for crypto is debatable. Search interest this October for the term “Bitcoin” is 82% lower than it was during its all-time high in December 2017, according toGoogle Trends. Signs of retail interest will become clearer on Wednesday after Robinhood and Coinbase release their own quarterly reports, which will detail the quarter-over-quarter change in volume of crypto transactions on each platform.

    "news_title": "Maker founder blames $5m rebrand flop on ‘typical DeFi mistake’ – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Sky founder Rune Christensen said he made a “typical DeFi mistake” when he pushed a rebrand that saw the storied stablecoin issuer ditch the Maker name in August. During a live forum on X on Tuesday where he alternated between defiance and introspection, Christensen said he assumed centralised exchanges like Coinbase and Binance would list Sky’s new governance token. “That just didn’t happen,” he said. “I totally underestimated how important centralised exchanges are nowadays.” The overhaul was supposed to take decentralised finance mainstream by introducing a cohesive, user-friendly brand, new tokens, and new ways to earn yield. While its new USDS stablecoin is already one of the largest, with a market value over $1.1 billion, its governance tokens have lost almost half their combined value. In a stunningabout-face, Christensen proposed on Monday to ditch the Sky brand and return to Maker. On Tuesday, he hopped on a liveforumon X to celebrate what the effort accomplished and to contemplate where it went wrong. Maker was confusing, Christensen argued since he first proposed the overhaul in 2022. Control of the protocol belongs to people who own its governance token, Maker. But its purpose is to mint a dollar-pegged stablecoin, DAI. While both were well-known to crypto die-hards, regular people might not know that the governance token and the stablecoin were related, he said. Some might not even know DAI was a stablecoin designed to always hold a value of $1 — after all, most have “USD” in their name. Even though DAI had long been the largest decentralised stablecoin — an alternative to those that can be frozen or seized by their issuers — its supply had stalled at about $5 billion amid intense competition from centralised incumbents run by Tether and Circle, as well as newcomers from Ethena and PayPal. The rebrand was part of a much larger overhaul, dubbed Endgame. In addition to taking DeFi mainstream, Endgame was meant to boost participation in MakerDAO, the cooperative that ran the Maker protocol. After contentious debates, a developerexodus, and some two years of work that cost about $5 million, according to oneestimate, Maker announced in August it had become Sky. Holders of Maker and DAI could convert those tokens to Sky and USDS tokens, respectively. There were other changes, and Christensen said they aren’t going anywhere. “Sky Launch wasn’t a rebrand, it was a huge amount of features,” hewroteon X Wednesday. The results have been mixed. While USDS has a market value over $1.1 billion, Sky’s is below $60 million, a lacklustre debut for a token designed for mass appeal. Maker, meanwhile, has taken a massive hit, its value falling almost 50% to $1,200 since the rebrand was unveiled. Christensen said the quick growth of USDS has been “momentous,” in part because it wasn’t necessarily “cannibalising the DAI demand.” “This is actually net new demand, resulting in total inflows into the system of something like six to $700 million,” he said. “A lot of people are going to enjoy dunking on me,” he said of his about-face. “But ultimately, … the purpose of the rebrand was to try to tap into new users and create net new demand. And that clearly succeeded.” But the SKY token bombed. “I thought that if you do a redenomination, and it has a cool ticker and all that, … that would appeal to a new group of potential users,” Christensen said. “And clearly that didn’t work out at all.” Meanwhile, users were confused by a protocol that now featured four separate tokens — Maker, Sky, DAI, and USDS — with overlapping functions. Christensen said he will create a poll by the end of the week asking people to choose between two potential fixes. The first is a return to the Maker brand featuring “extremely, extremely light touch” changes “like improving the font and making some changes to the colouring.” The second is to “go full classic” and undo the rebrand entirely. “Really all it changes is that it goes from Sky - formerly Maker,” he wrote Wednesday, “to Sky - powered by Maker.” As for Sky, it could become a “spin off front end that just kind of lives on its own,” or a so-called subDAO, like Sky’s in-house lending protocol, Spark. Vance Spencer, co-founder of crypto venture capital firm Framework Ventures, also spoke Tuesday. He said Framework was “one of the larger holders of Maker.” “USDS is a wonderful success story, and it’s going to continue to grow,” Spencer said. “We’ve confused people. [The rebrand] was definitely a shot on goal that was worth taking. Refocusing, recentering around the Maker brand is, I think, smart.” Aleksandar Gilbert is a DeFi Correspondent atDL News. Got a tip?

    "news_title": "Can you hack a hacker? Tapioca DAO’s $2.7m counter exploit says yes – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link A version of this article appeared in ourThe Decentralisednewsletter on October 29. Sign uphere. GM,Timhere. Tapioca DAO has hit back against its hacker after the fledgling DeFi lending protocol was kneecapped by a $4.7 million exploit. In a post-mortemreport, the protocol revealed it used a counter exploit to take back 996 Ether — worth $2.7 million — that the hacker stole. “The security team utilised an exploit to recover the ETH from the attacker before he could launder it,” the report said, withholding the specific details of how the counter exploit was conducted. The move turns Tapioca’s loss from a near wipe-out to a more manageable 45% loss. The post-mortem also revealed that a North Korean group was behind the attack. The group used a social engineering attack to trick a Tapioca DAO engineer into downloading malware. In response, Tapioca offered the hacker a $1 million bounty to return the funds by October 22, which has since been revoked. Hackers from the hermit kingdom don’t usually accept such bounties. Tapioca’s counter exploit isn’t the first time a protocol has forcibly taken back stolen funds from a hacker. In 2023, developers behind Oasis, the then-main gateway for top DeFi lending protocol Maker, reclaimed $140 million of stolen crypto from the Wormhole bridge hack. US crypto exchange Kraken is looking to replicate Coinbase’s success with the Base blockchain by building its own Ethereum layer 2. That blockchain, called Ink, will use fellow layer 2 Optimism’s infrastructure to offer faster and cheaper transactions than the Ethereum mainnet. Most people who own and trade crypto rarely interact directly with blockchain-based applications. Instead, they let centralised exchanges store and swap crypto on their behalf. That could be changing. Coinbase’s Base is growing fast. It recently surpassed Arbitrum to become the top layer 2 with$2.5 billionof deposits, and makes millions in profit for the exchange every quarter. But at the same time, the Ethereum layer 2 space is becoming increasingly crowded. There are nowover 100Ethereum layer 2s competing for users. Many in the Ethereum community also question if layer 2s negatively impact the main Ethereum network. Sky founder Rune Christensen said he made a “typical DeFi mistake” when he pushed a rebrand that saw the stablecoin issuer and lending protocol ditch the Maker name in August. The overhaul was supposed to take DeFi mainstream by introducing a cohesive, user-friendly brand and new versions of its tokens. But in a sudden about-face, Christensen proposed last week to ditch the Sky brand and return to Maker. He also hopped on a live forum on X to celebrate what the effort accomplished and to contemplate where it went wrong. Since the update, USDS, a new version of the DAI stablecoin, has soared to a market value of over $1.1 billion. Christensen said the quick growth of USDS was down to its appeal among a different demographic of users who weren’t previously using DAI. But at the same time, the protocol’s governance token has taken a massive hit, its value falling almost 50% to $1,200.

    "news_title": "Why the UK won’t see crypto rules soon — and that’s a good thing, says Gemini EU CEO   – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link A version of this story appeared in ourThe Guidancenewsletter on October 28.Sign uphere. The UK lags the EU on crypto regulation. While the ousted Tory government pushed to introduce new lawsthis summer, it will take the new Labour government at least another year to regain the momentum, says Gillian Lynch, head of Europe and Ireland at Gemini. And that’s a good thing, she adds. “If it means you get a really considered piece of regulation coming out in 12 to 18 months, that’s OK,” Lynch said. That may be too long for some crypto lobbyists who worry that a lag could see the country lose out on business to the EU, as businesses seek a clear regulatory environment. Brussels is rolling out one of the world’s most comprehensive regulatory frameworks for crypto: the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. MiCA’s stablecoin rules are in place for exchanges, wallets, and other crypto asset service providers. They will kick in at year-end. The UK Treasury published its final proposals for crypto regulations in October 2023.  The Financial Conduct Authority is working on the finer details of these laws. Bim Afolami, the minister responsible for the financial services sector, promised they’d be ready by summer 2024 — but a snap election that Labour won put paid to that. Lynch’s prediction is more pessimistic than other UK crypto insiders I’ve spoken to, who agree we could see laws proposed as early as the end of the year. But “you’ve got this change in government, and that always delays the implementation of a [regulatory] regime,” Lynch said. “If you’re only at the starting point of a new government, you’re still 12 months away at least from bringing something in.” Still, Lynch said, in some respects, it’s worth the wait, because MiCA will test many new regulatory concepts — some of which may require some fine-tuning. There’s already talk in policy circles of a “MiCA II” — an update to fill in gaps and tidy up messy things in MiCA. “Regulators globally are going to watch MiCA to see what works and what doesn’t,” Lynch said. Meanwhile, the FCA is bringing in rules that could form part of a future regime. Late last year it expanded existing rules on how financial firms are allowed to market themselves to crypto businesses. The strict rules saw PayPal and Binancesuspend servicesto the UK. Lynch conceded that the promotions rules are hard. But, she said, compliance is the cost of doing business, that it’s what consumers expect. Gemini ran a survey of 6,000 people in four major markets, including the UK and US. Almost 40% of respondents who did not own crypto said regulatory concerns kept them from entering the market. For now though, UK crypto rules are a waiting game. Reach out to me at joanna@dlnews.com.",

    "news_title": "Crypto holders fear they’ll get lumped in with uber-wealthy in UK budget’s tax plan – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Crypto holders should pay attention when the UK’s finance minister Rachel Reeves announces on Wednesday her party’s first UK budget in more than a decade. That’s according to Suzanne Morsfield, policy advisor at trade association CryptoUK, who said the prospect of Reeves hiking capital gains taxabove 28%will hit the some five million crypto holders in Britain particularly hard. “There’s a perception that capital gains tax mostly reaches the upper echelons of society… that it’s a way of making the wealthy shoulder more of the burden,” Morsfield toldDL News. “That’s not 100% accurate, especially when it comes to crypto.” Her caution comes after the British tech communitywarnedthat a tax hike may drive innovative firms away. It adds more pressure to the finance minister’s historic budget, a sweeping government financial plan that tends to rock markets in real time. Labour’s party’s first budget in 15 years — and the first to be announced by a female chancellor — comes after the party’s historic July 4 election rout saw many Conservatives ousted from power. The government already faced a backlash after it announced plans to axewinter fuel payments, which risks cutting into poorer pensioners’ savings. Tax on capital gains refers to earnings from investments into assets like shares or property. It affects very few people in the UK. This year, for instance, capital gains tax isexpected toraise £15.2 billion — just half of what will be gathered from income tax. However, almost all crypto investors are affected, as the primary way of taxing crypto assets is under the capital gains regime, Morsfield said. CryptoUK said that’s unfair, especially as many of the UK’s investors aren’t rich. Morsfield pointed tofiguresfrom the Financial Conduct Authority, which say that 63% of the UK’s five million crypto owners hold £500 or less in crypto. The mean holding was £1,600. “So we’re not talking about the uber-wealthy only being affected by this — it’s everyday people with relatively small holdings who will get hit disproportionately,” she said. ‘It’s everyday people with relatively small holdings who will get hit disproportionately.’ Reeves is considering hiking capital gains tax to fillwhat the Treasury saidwas a £22 billion hole in the public finances left by the Conservative government. “The chancellor has an unenviable challenge ahead — closing a vast public funding gap that looms over the party’s leadership,” Xapo Bank COO Dary McGovern toldDL News. Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised that Labour won’t raise taxes that hit working people — VAT, income tax, and national insurance. But it will hike taxes on capital gains and inheritance. Press reportedthat Reeves was modelling a hike as high as 39%. Starmer thendeniedit would be that steep. In the UK, crypto is taxed like stocks. If you sell your crypto, receive it as a gift, or move it around in some way, you probably have to give some of that to the government under the capital gains regime — 10 to 18% for basic rate taxpayers, or 20 to 24% for higher income taxpayers. Crypto holders are particularly vulnerable to capital gains tax, Morsfield said. For one, you can’t put crypto into ISA accounts, which shield assets from tax up to a certain threshold. Another reason is that certain decentralised finance lending transactions aretaxed more punitivelythan comparable transactions made in traditional assets, Morsfield said. It’s extremely unlikely that every crypto investor in the UK will sell off their crypto en masse to the degree that it would create a market event, Morsfield said. Still, she said, if the government wants to collect revenue on any asset subject to capital gains, it must calibrate the hike carefully — hike it too high and investors hold on to their assets, depriving the government of the revenue it hoped to raise. “The punchline is that with capital gains taxes, people change their behaviour,” Morsfield said. “Investors decide to sell earlier or hold on longer, and then you don’t get the taxes you’ve modelled for.” Capital gains hikes may appeal to Reeves as a short-term fix, but could discourage long-term investment, McGovern said. “Labour must ensure that investors aren’t driven to riskier short-term positions, and instead are confident to put their money into safer, long-term investments like Bitcoin,” he said.

    "news_title": "Hong Kong poised to approve more crypto exchanges in regulatory push – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Hong Kong’s financial watchdog is poised to add more digital asset exchanges to its regulated roster by the year’s end. This follows a five-month review aimed at strengthening crypto oversight in Hong Kong. The Securities and Futures Commission, or SFC,indicatedthat licensed exchanges will operate under restrictions until they pass a third-party review, after which they can transition to full approval. “The applicants have taken up our feedback, and are willing to commit resources to rectify issues,”saidEric Yip, SFC’s executive director for intermediaries, at Hong Kong Fintech Week. Hong Kong aspires to be Asia’s top crypto hub and compete with South Korea, Singapore, and other locales. To that end, regulators swiftly approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs a few months after US officialscleared the wayfor the mass market funds in January. Yet officials are also labouring to curb the runaway fraud that has plagued its digital assets marketplace for the last two years. A number of phantom exchange such asJPEXhave ripped off investors of hundreds of millions of dollars in deposits, officials say. So far, only three exchanges — OSL, HashKey, and HKVAX — have met the SFC’s stringent requirements. Bullish, Crypto.com, and Matrixport are among the14 platformsin the “deemed-to-be-licensed” category. Julia Leung, the head of the SFC, recentlytolda local media outlet that the agency aims to grant conditional licences to firms meeting all requirements by the end of the year. This approach is part of a largerpushto transform Hong Kong into a digital asset powerhouse with a regulatory regime that protects investors. While stronger compliance measures may sound good to investors, they have proved too onerous for some exchanges. OKX, Huobi, Gate.HK, and Bybit, have each withdrawn their applications to cater to Hong Kong investors earlier this year. Although these firms didn’t specify reasons for withdrawing, a major regulatory hurdle appears to be Hong Kong’srestrictionon serving mainland Chinese clients. The JPEX scandal looms large over the regulatory push. In September 2023, SFC warned the public about unlicensed activities and false claims of regulatory approval by a Dubai-based exchange called JPEX. This prompted a wave of fraud complaints that led to the exchange freezing accounts and transactions. When the dust settled, customers reportedlossestotaling around USD 200 million.

    "news_title": "Bitcoin falls as Tether CEO calls criminal probe report ‘old noise’ – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino took to social media to deny a report the company is facing a criminal investigation over allegations its cryptocurrency is popular with drug traffickers and terrorists. “As we told to [Wall Street Journal] there is no indication that Tether is under investigation,” he wrote on X Friday afternoon. “WSJ is regurgitating old noise. Full stop.” Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating the use of Tether’s eponymous stablecoin in the financing of drug trafficking, terrorism, and hacking,The Wall Street Journalreported Friday. At the same time, the US Treasury Department is considering sanctioning the company over sanctioned entities’ use of its cryptocurrency, according to the report. “It is wildly irresponsible for WSJ to write articles with reckless allegations with such certainty when no authorities have gone on the record to confirm these rumors, and no sources are named,” Tether said in a statement. “These stories  are based on pure rank speculation despite Tether confirming that it has no knowledge of any such investigations into the company.” Crypto prices plunged on the news. As of 3 pm New York time, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana had fallen 2.7%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, from their Friday highs. Tether fluctuated wildly in the moment afterthe Journalpublished its report, firstdroppingas low at 99.3 cents before rebounding to $1.01, according to CoinGecko. Tether is the world’s largest stablecoin, with almost $120 billion in circulation Friday, according to DefiLlama data. That accounts for almost 70% of the supply of all stablecoins. Its next closest competitor, Circle’s USD Coin, had a market capitalisation of $34 billion Friday. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector’s volatility while allowing them to keep their wealth on the blockchain. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, Tether is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Stablecoins have also been touted as a safe asset in economies experiencing severe inflation and a cheaper, faster way to move money between borders. Tether has long faced intense scrutiny, given its dominant position in the stablecoin market. In 2021, the company paid fines of almost $60 million after settling with the New York Attorney General’s Office and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.BothallegedTether’s stablecoin wasn’t fully backed by cash or cash equivalents. Tether did not admit wrongdoing in connection with theformerand, regarding thelattercase, said it always had adequate reserves — just not necessarily in cash. Tether has also failed to produce audits that could reassure users who worry its stablecoin isn’t fully or safely collateralized. A lack of adequate collateral could leave some Tether holders empty-handed in the event too many rush to cash out at the same time — a fear that has yet to materialise. In aninterviewwithDL Newsin April, Ardoino said the Big Four accounting firms — Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG — are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. That fear stems in part from Tether’s controversial role in the world economy. When the US hit Venezuela’s state-run oil producer with a new round of sanctions in April, the companyturnedto the Tether stablecoin. Tether quickly said it would freeze wallets linked to any entity that tried to evade sanctions. TRM Labs, a crypto-sleuthing company,calledUSDT the “currency of choice” for terrorism financing. And a Chainalysis reportshowedthat stablecoins, including Tether, make up roughly 60% of illicit crypto transactions. Tether, for its part, has been proactive in freezing wallets associated with criminal activity. In September, itseizedover $6 million tied to a Southeast Asian crypto-confidence scheme. The Wall Street Journal’sreporting “carelessly glosses over Tether’s well-documented and extensive dealings with law enforcement to crack down on bad actors seeking to  misuse tether and other cryptocurrencies,” Tether said in its statement. Update, October 25:This article has been updated to include a statement from Tether. Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York. He can be reached at aleks@dlnews.com.",

    "news_title": "DYdX, Kraken add to crypto’s bloody week after Consensys layoffs – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link A pair of crypto companies announced dramatic cuts on Tuesday just as a market rally pushed Bitcoinnear its all-time high. Decentralised crypto exchange developer dYdX cut 35% of its staff Tuesday, CEO Antonio Juliano said in a statement. Those layoffs came hours after Consensys, the company behind the Metamask crypto wallet, cut 20% of its workforce. And on Wednesday, crypto exchange Kraken laid off about 15% of its workforce, the New York Timesreported. The news comes as almost 400 crypto workers have lost their jobs so far this year, according toLayoffs.fyi. That’s down from the brutal purges of 2022 and 2023, when around 8,300 and 6,800 crypto workers lost their jobs respectively. The new layoffs also come against a backdrop of crypto investors prepare for abull marketthat could send Bitcoin to record highs. Analysts anticipate the industry to rally thanks to a combination of macroeconomic factors like a Chinese stimulus package, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and the possible election of Donald Trump. That’s kept the job marketactive, according to a recentDL Newsreport. Thetop 10exchanges are looking to fill around 1,100 roles right now. Fintechs and traditional payments providers are also recruiting crypto talent. Neither dYdX nor Consensys shared the exact number of employees who were laid off. In a brief blog post published Wednesday, Kraken said it was “making organizational discipline decisions” after appointing venture investor Arjun Sethi as co-CEO. But the company did not say whether it had cut employees, and a Kraken declined to comment when contacted byDL News. Julianosharedfew details Tuesday about the reason for the cuts at dYdX. But in a subsequent blog post published Wednesday, he said the company had stagnated as it went from “startup mode” to “company mode.” “I went from managing the whole team to five layers of hierarchy between the builders and me,” hewrote. “No more execs, no more middle management, no more company processes, no more fucking anything except the builders and me.” Consensys, meanwhile, blamed the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s “abuse of power” for its woes. Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin said that the SEC’s crypto crackdown combined with “regulatory uncertainty” and “broader macroeconomic conditions” has “made navigating our evolving space unnecessarily complex for innovators, builders, investors, and businesses.” Consensys said in April that it had been served with a Wells notice — an SEC letter informing recipients of looming enforcement action. “Such attacks from the US government will end up costing many companies that have been investigated, sued, or sent Wells Notices, many millions of dollars,” Lubin wrote in a blog announcing the layoffs. The companysuedthe SEC later that month for allegedly waging a “campaign to seize control over the future of cryptocurrency.” Industry stalwarts Coinbase, Greyscale, and the Blockchain Association, have also taken the SEC to court to challenge its campaign to bring crypto to heel. In his blog post, Lubin said the layoffs were part of Consensys’ “progressively decentralising itself.” “Consensys is transforming itself to naturally evolve from a company into a Network State over time,” hewrote. “By right-sizing and re-architecting our company now towards being a more loosely coupled set of orthogonal teams, we are positioning ourselves to contribute more effectively.” Update, October 30: This story was updated to include reports that Kraken had laid off 15% of its workforce and that a spokesperson declined to comment on those reports.

    "news_title": "FTX strikes $228m settlement with Bybit, moves closer to customer refunds – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link FTX has agreed to drop litigation against crypto exchange Bybit in a $228 million settlement that will let FTX recover a substantial portion of funds held on the platform. The agreement will allow FTX to reclaim $175 million in digital assets from Bybit’s exchange and sell additional assets, including BIT tokens, to Bybit’s investment arm Mirana Corp. for $53 million. The legal dispute, filed by FTX last year, alleged that Bybit-affiliated accounts moved $327 million off FTX just before its collapse, leaving other customers locked out of withdrawals. “Through the Settlement Agreement, the Debtors will be recovering substantially everything that they seek to recover,” FTXstated. This settlement brings FTX closer to repaying customers affected by its 2022 collapse. FTX’s repayment plan, approved earlier this month, earmarks at least$12.6 billionfor distribution. Payments are set to begin within 60 days of the effective date, however, this date is still to be determined. Though repayment amounts are based oncrypto valuesfrom two years ago, FTX’s team, led by CEO John Ray, is actively working to finalise global disbursement logistics across hundreds of jurisdictions.

    "news_title": "Polymarket punters beware — even betting markets are subject to wishful thinking  – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Wolfgang Münchau is a columnist for DL News. He is co-founder and director of Eurointelligence, and writes a column on European affairs for the New Statesman. Opinions are his own. This has not been such a great year for political opinion polling, but it looks like a great year for the betting markets. If Donald Trump were to win the elections, the betting market crowd will gloat unbearably. But right now, a week before the elections, the race is too close to call. In such a situation, getting your prediction right is like winning a coin toss. I am not betting against the betting markets, because unlike them, I don’t place 50/50 bets. We should not judge such a bet by its outcome. Imagine a hypothetical situation where we would all be betting on a televised coin toss contest the next day. Let’s assume the betting markets show “Team Heads” at 70%. What would this mean? Surely, Team Heads is not trying to manipulate the result. The odds of any fair coin toss are always 50/50, not 70/30, irrespective of what people believe. My hypothetical thought experiment is obviously mischievous. Politics is not a game of chance. But an election too close to call is, from a probabilistic perspective, similar to a coin toss. The lead Trump has built up over Kamala Harris on Polymarket is almost surely noise. I cannot completely rule out that thefour Polymarket accountsthat made up the lion’s share of the bets in favour of Trump may have colluded with one another. (There’s also speculationthe accounts are controlledby one entity.) They may have had inside information. Maybe they have access to a better poll than the rest of us. That would invalidate my mug’s game hypothesis to some extent. But can there be such information? Eight years ago in the UK, I recall that investors commissioned a large exit poll on the day of the Brexit referendum. They got the result a few hours before the poll closed. But that was a large-sample exit poll. These bets were placed a few weeks before the election. At that point, even an expensive poll might get it wrong, given the complexity of the US voting system and uncertainty about turnout. If things are as tight as this election’s polls suggest, small shifts in voter participation have disproportionately large effects on the vote. I struggle to see how the most expensive poll could be more reliable than the poll of all the other published polls. If valuable private insights are hard to come by, there can be no hard information in the pricing of the bets. The idea that betting market prices carry valuable information is critically based on the assumption that the sum total of market participants have superior knowledge. I think this is true of financial markets in general. But I don’t think this is true of political betting markets that are full of noise traders. In my line of work — political and economic risk analysis — it is common for consensus views to be wrong. In fact, I would argue this is mostly the case. Two and a half years ago, a large consensus existed in western Europe and the US that sanctions would stop Vladimir Putin from waging his war on Ukraine. An army of armchair generals predicted that Ukraine would inflict victory over Russia within weeks. The main instinct in political and economic commentary is the herd instinct. Betting markets function in similar ways. The reason why political commentators keep getting it wrong is that they succumbed to a cognitive condition known as confirmation bias — or wishful thinking. Betting markets are a form of political commentary. Another form of cognitive bias that afflicts pollsters and statisticians is model bias. I have met many hundreds of economists in my life, but I have yet to meet one who changed their belief system and their models on the ground that they are not supported by empirical facts. The world ofpsephologyis full of models too. I don’t have any problems with the betting markets. I am making no accusations. I saw a few unfounded conspiracy theories about market manipulation. I do not believe any of them. I just don’t think betting markets are contributing anything useful to our understanding about the US elections. Just to be clear: I am not saying Harris will win. I just don’t know. All I know is that the candidates have been within polling error margins from each other through most of the campaign. So what should we do when confronted with radical uncertainty of such magnitude? The way to deal with the unknowable is not through prediction but through hedging and preparation. This is true for both investors and politicians. In 2016, the Europeans were totally unprepared for a Trump presidency. Now they pretend they are, but I don’t see any evidence. Smart people hedge.",

    "news_title": "Binance to face prosecution in Nigeria after freed exec returns to US – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link A version of this story appeared in ourThe Roundupnewsletter on October 11.Sign uphere. Tigran Gambaryan’s ordeal ended this week. Binance’s legal woes in Nigeria did not. This is the upshot from a dramatic turn of events in one of the most closely followed legal cases in crypto. On Wednesday, Nigerian authoritiesdroppedcharges against Gambaryan, a 40-year-old Binance compliance executive, and released him from custody. AsOsato Avan-Nomayoreported, Gambaryan madea swift departurefrom the African nation and headed home to his family in suburban Atlanta. It turns out the Biden Administration’sdiplomatic effortsplayed a key role in getting the Nigerians to act and let Gambaryan come home. But it took a while. In February, Gambaryan was detained by Nigeria’s anti-corruption agency after he arrived to talk to government officials about Binance’s operations in the nation. For months, Gambaryan was incarcerated in a prison in Abuja, the Nigerian capital. Suffering from malaria and a herniated disc in his back, as well as a bout of pneumonia, the Binance man struggled to defend himself in his trial on a money laundering indictment. At one point, hecollapsedin the courtroom. From the get-go, Gambaryan’s lawyers argued he was being used as a “state-sponsored hostage” in connection with the government’s long-running battle with Binance, which operates in Nigeriawithout a licence. Even as US lawmakersvisited him in prisonand called for his release, there seemed to be no movement whatsoever on the part of Nigerian officials. The court even denied Gambaryan bail during his trial. Now the spotlight will turn to Binance itself, which is still facing prosecution on money laundering charges in Nigeria. The company has denied the allegations. The trial is scheduled to begin in November. In other news, Maker founder Rune Christensen said he made a “typical DeFi mistake” when he pushed a rebrand that saw the storied stablecoin issuer ditch the Maker name in August. AsAleks GilbertandLiam Kellyreported, Maker opted to change its name to Sky with an eye to taking DeFi mainstream by introducing a user-friendly brand, new tokens, and new ways to earn yield. ButMaker loyalists baulked. “It’s not an easy feat to be the oldest protocol in DeFi, trusted by whales for almost a decade, and Sky would start from 0 in that department.” Another DeFi stalwart, Cardano, was also in the news thanks toa profileof founder Charles Hoskinson byBen Weiss. In a wide-ranging interview, the Ethereum co-founder explained why he searches for extraterrestrial life, develops glow-in-the-dark weed, and believes stem cell research may hold answers for longevity science.

    "news_title": "BRICS seen supercharging Bitcoin price as dollar dominance erodes – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Bitcoin could get another massive macro boost triggered by the BRICS club’s attempt to dampen the dollar’s primacy in international trade. BRICS is a geopolitical alliance of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates were added to its ranks earlier this year. Together, the group accounts for over one-third of global GDP. Now, it wants to explore an alternative international payment system. Country delegates met this week and agreed to pursue a payment system that used their national currencies as a replacement for dollar-based Swift. While Bitcoin is unlikely to be the currency that BRICS adopts, the cryptocurrency will still benefit, Noelle Acheson said in her “Crypto is Macro Now” newsletter. “Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge against dollar debasement will strengthen, as weakening global demand for dollar-based trade, at a time of increasing supply, should pull the dollar down in relative terms,” Acheson wrote. While BRICS nations including China and India have their owntussles, they also hold shared grievances with the US. Their opposition to the West on geopolitical and economic issues could fuel the club’s development of a dollar rival. Still, the dollar isn’t expected to lose its global reserve currency status anytime soon. US stocks account for almost two-thirds of the world’s stock market value and all but two of the 10 largest companies by market value arebased there. Even Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted last week that itwasn’t timefor a common BRICS currency. Still, even the perceived notion of such significant shifts in economic and geopolitical realities could positively impact Bitcoin. Or as Acheson puts it, the situation boosts demand for hedge assets. Bitcoin proponents often propose the digital asset can serve as a buffer against uncertainty even with its volatile price movements. They made similar arguments for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation due to its scarcity and perceived independence from mainstream markets. Recently, some proponents have backed the claim by saying the rising debt burden occasioned by monetary policy steps to curb inflation in the UShas upped Bitcoin’s profile as a suitable hedge asset. This week, billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones raised concerns over the US national debt which is almost at par with its gross domestic product. Jones said assets like gold and Bitcoin are abetter investment strategythan bonds in the current economic climate. Osato Avan-Nomayois our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

    "news_title": "TP Icap says commodities firms want in on hedge funds’ favourite crypto trade – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Commodities houses want a slice ofa lucrative crypto tradethat hedge funds have been piling into this year. That’s according to London-based trading and brokerage giant TP Icap. Simon Forster, the co-head of the firm’s digital asset arm, toldDL Newsthat he’s seen “significant interest from commodities houses and structured products desks” looking to access the crypto market for arbitrage trades. It’s the latest sign of traditional finance’s growing love affair with crypto. Less than a year after the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, Wall Street is set tosurpassBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto as the largest holder of Bitcoin. While Wall Street’sembracehas done much to establish crypto as an investment-worthy asset class, commodities houses have so far had little interest in Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, according to Forster. The so-called basis trade “has been a huge driver of this year’s Bitcoin ETF activity,” he said. The basis trade is a so-called market-neutral strategy, meaning that traders don’t rely on prices going up or down to make a profit. The trade involves taking advantage of the difference in price between an asset’s spot price and its futures price. Hedge funds have been piling into this trade at an “unprecedented scale,” CF Benchmarks toldDL Newsin June. “But commodities firms often prefer to trade the underlying physical asset rather than an equity equivalent,” Forster said. TP Icap on Friday announced it will link its crypto exchange, Fusion Digital Assets, with Standard Chartered’s crypto custody product to better serve these new types of clients. The partnership will let TP Icap customers access Standard Chartered’s product, and vice versa, the companiessaid in a statement. “Broadening our base with Standard Chartered’s geographic footprint and new spot custody offering significantly expands the universe of clients we can serve,” Forster said. Duncan Trenholme, TP Icap’s global co-Head of digital assets, said in the statement that the partnership enhances “our existing operating model with connectivity to a leading international cross-border bank, and will give clients further assurances to enter and trade in these emerging asset classes.” Aleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York.

    "news_title": "Here’s how high Standard Chartered says Bitcoin will jump if Republicans sweep the election – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link A Republican sweep will push Bitcoin to $125,000 by the end of the year, says Standard Chartered. The British bank said that if Republicans win the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the White House, it will be easier for the digital asset industry to pass favourable new laws. And if Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the next president? “In a Harris scenario, we still think BTC can end the year at around $75,000,” Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital asset research, wrote in a note on Friday. It no longer matters how the US elections pan out on November 5, say analysts: Bitcoin is headed for the moon. Now, it’s only a question of how high. That’s because both Trump and Harris have made pro-crypto overtures ahead of the vote. The former president’s full-throated advocacy has, however, made him a favourite in some crypto circles. Supporters such as Messari’sRyan Selkishave argued that crypto’s future hinges on Trump’s ability to reclaim the White House. This has given rise to the so-called “Trump trade,” the idea that Bitcoin will soar if the real estate tycoon wins. In September, Bernstein analysts predicted that Bitcoin’s price would surge to$90,000this year if that happens, but it would fall as low as $30,000 if Harris were elected. They have since changed their tune and predict it will hit$200,000 by the end of 2025. Similarly, aKaiko analysisof Bitcoin options data suggests that traders already bet the cryptocurrency will hit a new all-time high no matter who wins the election. After calling Bitcoin a “scam” in 2021, Trumpflippedthe script in May and campaigns as a pro-crypto candidate. His sons haveeven launcheda DeFi project called World Liberty Financial. Harris, though initially quiet on the matter,saidin September that her administration will boost America’s competitiveness and partner with companies to “encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets.” Standard Chartered’s note also says Harris would be less negative for crypto than another Biden term. That’s because Bidenvetoed a billthat would have allowed traditional banks to custody cryptocurrencies. “With digital assets having become a more prominent political issue since then, we doubt whether a Harris administration would seek the same veto,” wrote Kendrick.. “Bitcoin would head higher after an initial dip, once the market recognises that regulatory change is still likely under Harris, even if at a slower pace.” Liam Kelly isDL NewsBerlin-based DeFi Correspondent.

    "news_title": "Circle resilient on IPO route, CEO says funding isn’t needed as USDC growth soars – DL News",
    "news_content": "About us Copy link Circle is pushing ahead with plans to go public as its USDC stablecoin’s growth picks up pace, according to CEO Jeremy Allaire. Despite a challenging regulatory environment and previous setbacks, Circle is taking the traditional IPO route, with no immediate need for external capital. “We are very committed to the path of going public,”Allaire saidin a Bloomberg interview. He added that Circle is financially strong and not seeking additional funding as it awaits approval for its JanuaryIPO filingwith the SEC. Allaire is confident in the utility value of its USDC, which is being used in cross-border payments and by crypto traders moving assets between exchanges. Traders also use stablecoins as a way to protect their assets from volatility without completely exiting the market. USDC has captured the second-highest market share among stablecoins with a total market value of nearly $35 billion. However, it is still some ways off the market leader, Tether’s USDT, which has a market value of over $120 billion. Allaire expressed optimism thatstablecoin legislationcould pass in the US this year, seeing it as a critical step to encouraging traditional finance to embrace digital assets. “New guardrails will allow safer, more transparent access for banks and payment companies,” he said. However, some lawmakers aren’t so confident. US Rep. Maxine Watersurgedher committee to strike a bipartisan deal on stablecoin regulation last month but acknowledged time is running out. According to Waters, political divisions are complicating the finalisation of any compromise. Kyle Baird is DL News’ Weekend Editor. Got a tip? Email atkbaird@dlnews.com.",
