    "news_title": "Crypto: New Peak For BNB In Sight? Analysis Of October 30, 2024 - Cointribune",
    "news_content": "Discover our Read to Earn Program Home»News»Finance News BNB is generating increasing interest, hinting at imminent expansion. Let’s explore together the future prospects for BNB. After reaching an all-time high just below $725, BNB has experienced a decline that brought its price around $403. Since then, the crypto has been undergoing a consolidation phase in the form of an ascending triangle, remaining above the annual VWAP. The buying interest for BNB appears strong, with consistently higher lows. However, the resistance at $605 remains difficult to overcome, raising questions about the continuation of buying interest. It is also noteworthy that BNB is currently above its monthly pivot point, the POC, and the monthly VWAP. These factors suggest a potential continuation for BNB’s upward movement.At the time of writing, theBNB priceis trading around $602, very close to its resistance. Since this has not yet been broken, it is difficult to assert that the medium-term trend is bullish. However, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, located below its price and having recently formed a golden cross, suggest otherwise. Thus, the crypto appears to be in a phase of uncertainty. As for BNB’s bullish momentum, it remains slightly supported, as evidenced by the oscillators and the price of the crypto itself. The current technical analysis has been conducted in collaboration with Elie FT, a passionate investor and trader in the cryptocurrency market. Currently a trainer atFamily Trading, a community of thousands of active retail traders since 2017. You will find Lives, educational content, and mutual support around financial markets in a professional and friendly atmosphere. The open interest of perpetual BNB contracts and their CVD continue to evolve in line with the underlying asset’s price, revealing growing interest from speculators, primarily on the buy side. Positive funding rates confirm the optimism of speculators on the crypto’s perpetual contracts. Regarding liquidations, a recent spike in short position liquidations has been observed, which could indicate a capitulation of sellers. The liquidation heatmap of BNB/USDT over three months shows that the crypto is located below an important liquidation zone identified around $620. Other notable, more subtle liquidation zones can be found below the current price of BNB, particularly under $600, under $560, and under $530. If the price approaches these levels, this could trigger a large number of orders, thus increasing the volatility of the cryptocurrency. These zones therefore represent a crucial point of interest for investors. BNB is showing signs of recovery with visible buying support, but its bullish trend remains uncertain in the face of persistent resistance. Although some indicators are encouraging, the current situation calls for caution while waiting for clearer signals. Thus, all that remains is to closely observe the price reaction at the various key levels to validate or adjust the current forecasts. Finally, let’s remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria, and that the prices of cryptocurrencies can evolve rapidly based on other more fundamental factors.
