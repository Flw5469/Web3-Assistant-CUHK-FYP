The unknown waltz was discovered in the vault of the Morgan Library and Museum in New York.

Front man Thom Yorke hit back at the fan after he heckled the singer over death numbers in Gaza during a performance at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melborne. Lovisa Sjoberg disappeared after driving into the mountains to take photographs. David Warner's lifetime leadership ban is lifted by Cricket Australia, leaving him free to captain in domestic cricket. Former Australia opener David Warner says he is available to come out of Test retirement for the upcoming series against India. Front man Thom Yorke hit back at the fan after he heckled the singer over death numbers in Gaza during a performance at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melborne. Sixty-three thousand of the limited edition coins were reported stolen in July. Albanese has said he followed the rules and was \"completely transparent\" with all disclosures. Australian wicketkeeper-batter Matthew Wade announces retirement from international cricket and takes up coaching role. Lovisa Sjoberg disappeared after driving into the mountains to take photographs. An Aboriginal senator's heckling of the King ignites debate about how to best address inequality in Australia. King Charles and Queen Camilla drew a warm reception from the crowds in Sydney's sunshine. The woman spent seven hours upside down between the boulders, with only her feet visible to rescuers. Eight months after his cancer diagnosis was revealed, this royal tour is important for Charles - and the monarchy. Experts say a tool supposedly helping nonverbal people speak is prompting false criminal allegations. An Australian says \"you can't get any better than that\" after meeting King Charles and Queen Camilla in Sydney. The woman shouted \"you are not our King\" and \"this is not your land\" before being escorted out. The BBC asks Australians about the King's visit this week and local feelings about the monarchy. \"That was fun. I'm OK. Sometimes there's just a hole in the stage,\" she tells an audience in Melbourne. The ride was stopped due to a \"sensor communication fault\", according to a theme park official.

From abortion to trade, here are his policy pledges as he runs for the White House for a third time. The spotlight is on Pennsylvania - the swing state with the most electoral votes - as the election approaches.

An in-depth look at the polls and what they can and can’t tell us about who will win the White House. The president is accused of denigrating Trump supporters - but says he was only attacking a comedian's remark. Both candidates hold rallies in a key swing state of Wisconsin, as they seek to win over undecided voters. It is the first presidential election since the top court overturned Roe v Wade, which protected the nationwide right to an abortion. The BBC's North America editor Sarah Smith gives the lowdown on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Bannon says his time in prison \"not only didn’t break me, it empowered me\". Biden appeared to call Trump supporters \"garbage\", but he later said he was specifically referring to a \"hateful\" remark by a pro-Trump comedian.

    "news_content": "Ohio Senator JD Vance is Trump's running mate for the US presidential election. Here's everything you need to know about him. The junior senator from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and morphed from a 'never-Trumper' into a Maga champion. The Ohio senator once said he would never vote for Donald Trump - but is now his running mate. A graduate of Cambridge University and Yale, Usha Vance has influenced her husband JD Vance's career since they first met. It is reported the Republican candidates' phones may have been among the targets of a broader cyber attack. From abortion to trade, here are his policy pledges as he runs for the White House for a third time. Trying to understand it for the first time or need a refresher? This guide can help. The Harris campaign has praised a judge's decision in Georgia to block a move by Trump supporters to have ballots there counted by hand. BBC Verify looks into claims made about the US government's response to Hurricane Helene. The restrained debate was a stark contrast to the fiery showdown between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, writes Anthony Zurcher. Vance and Walz focused their attacks on Harris and Trump's plans on the economy, immigration and abortion. The Republican dodged a question during the vice-presidential debate about the poll four years ago. \"I’m a knucklehead at times,\" the Democratic running mate says, conceding he was in the US when Chinese forces crushed protests. The BBC's North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher says the vice-presidential candidates found common ground. BBC Verify examined the claims Walz and Vance made during the first and only vice-presidential debate. Walz cites the story of Amber Thurman, a Georgia woman who died after not being able to access abortion care. Copyright 2024 BBC.

    "news_content": "Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is Harris's running mate for the US presidential election. Here's everything you need to know about him. The Minnesota governor is a veteran, former teacher and football coach and spent more than a decade in Congress. A educator and prison reform advocate, Gwen Walz advises her husband from an office in the Minnesota capitol. The Minnesota governor is a former public school teacher, National Guardsman and member of Congress. How have the vice-president's views changed since she first entered politics? Trump's team accuses activists of making illegal contributions, but the UK prime minister says volunteers have travelled to the US before. Trying to understand it for the first time or need a refresher? This guide can help. The Harris campaign has praised a judge's decision in Georgia to block a move by Trump supporters to have ballots there counted by hand. The restrained debate was a stark contrast to the fiery showdown between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, writes Anthony Zurcher. Vance and Walz focused their attacks on Harris and Trump's plans on the economy, immigration and abortion. \"I’m a knucklehead at times,\" the Democratic running mate says, conceding he was in the US when Chinese forces crushed protests. The BBC's North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher says the vice-presidential candidates found common ground. BBC Verify examined the claims Walz and Vance made during the first and only vice-presidential debate. Walz cites the story of Amber Thurman, a Georgia woman who died after not being able to access abortion care. When questioned about saying he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre, Walz says he \"misspoke\". JD Vance and Tim Walz face off in New York Copyright 2024 BBC.

    "news_content": "Artificial intelligence is being used to generate paintings, images and even sculptures, with some selling for thousands of dollars. Do we need to reframe our definition of art? AI runs unfathomable operations on billions of lines of text, handling problems that humans can't dream of solving – but you can probably still trounce them at brain teasers. Not sure what to eat tonight? Artificial intelligence wants to tell you what to cook, but are the recipes it creates any good? We put it to the test. AI v The Mind: We explore the world of food and ask if human expertise is the only way to deliver great flavour. We asked a professional comedian to deliver jokes written by artificial intelligence on stage. It revealed a lot about how much machines understand the human humour. In a clash of wit and technology, we bring together two unlikely adversaries: a comedian and an AI chatbot. If you're struggling to say you're sorry, AI is happy to help. But can robots handle social intelligence? We put their apologies to the test. How we deal with knotty interpersonal problems is a test for a different form of intelligence. The BBC is launching a new series to explore the limits of artificial intelligence by pitting it against the most powerful thinking machines on the planet – the human brain. In a new series, we will test the limits of the latest AI technology by pitting it against human experts. Copyright 2024 BBC.

    "news_content": "With each inhalation and exhalation we have the ability to change the way we think and feel. Smartwatches gather vast amounts of data about our physiology. Now their technology is being harnessed like never before. Friendships are a core part of who we are – so what happens to us when they end? Many remedies from the 18th and 19th Centuries have not stood the test of time, but cod liver oil remains an exception. Few people think twice about barcodes, but in the 75 years since they were first dreamed up, they have helped save lives, gone into space and stoked fears of the Antichrist. Nuclear waste remains toxic for thousands of years. How do you build a storage facility that will keep it safely buried for millennia? The BBC is launching a first-of-its-kind newsletter course, Six Steps to Calm, for international audiences. A mother says she remains in \"disbelief\" at the lack of testing for the drugs when someone has died. Angharad Dennis had a stroke in March, but said it has given her a fresh perspective on life. Just over 591,000 babies were born in the UK last year - the lowest number in four decades Pollution levels in the Indian capital have reached 20-25 times more than the WHO's recommended safe limit. Researcher Dr Roy Smith said stomach contents were the \"smoking gun\" evidence for the diets. A lack of awareness of selective mutism is making diagnosis life worse for families living with it. Up to 50% of twins develop their own communication pattern with one another. Most lose it over time, but for the Youlden twins it has become a normal way of communicating. Evidence has been found of an ancient animal as well as nomadic hunter-gatherers and Roman farms. Charlotte Lay was then able to save her husband's life by helping him get a cancer diagnosis.

    "news_content": "Among the shifting trends of the 21st Century, there's one key factor that's increasingly driving people's desire to travel: the spirit of scientific enquiry. A rugged land of glaciers, mountains and fjords, South Georgia is one of the remotest places on Earth. Once symbolic of the power and wealth of the Nattukottai Chettiar community, thousands of gigantic and glamourous mansions in Tamil Nadu now lie in ruins. Each year, the small South Australian town of Whyalla becomes home to one of the most spectacular underwater events: the spawning of the giant Australian cuttlefish. From pirate haven to ecological hotspot, Cuba's \"Treasure Island\" is a far-flung gem home to some of the Caribbean's rarest animals. In Belize's ATM Cave, details of ancient Maya religious sacrifices come into focus as new research creates a picture of how rituals were used to re-enact the Maya creation story. New research is revealing that Stonehenge may have been used for exclusive ceremonies. In the remote, mountainous region of 'Asir, women's ingenuity can be seen in a 200-year-old artform that's passed from mother to daughter. The director of Boston's renowned Institute of Contemporary Art shares her picks for the best ways to explore Boston's fastest-growing neighbourhood. Once a degraded backwater, Argentina's Iberá Wetlands is home to a stunning collection of wildlife – and one of the continent's most ambitious eco-initiatives. Cardamom and pistachios flavour this smooth and creamy frozen treat, which has origins dating as far back as the 16th Century. As of 1 December, Fiji instituted a quarantine-free travel policy to welcome vaccinated travellers from countries across the globe. The James Beard award-winning chef's ancestral soup combines a richly simmered broth with herbs, avocado and traditional mofongo balls: garlicky twice-fried mashed green plantains. Deeply rooted in Costa Rican and Nicaraguan culture, this staple of rice and beans with a side of eggs gets a spicy kick from Salsa Lizano (a sauce similar to Worcestershire). The idea of seasonal eating reaches its apotheosis in Sweden on Midsummer Eve, a magical day of feasting where a cake layered with strawberries and cream is the crowning glory. Egypt may have the Pyramids of Giza, but Iraq has the Ziggurat of Ur – an incredibly well-preserved engineering achievement that towers over the ruins of an important ancient city.

    "news_content": "Fourteen years after the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, would we fare any better at cleaning up another huge oil spill? How much energy you can pack into a battery is one limit on how big an EV can get – but meet the EVs ditching batteries altogether to attain mammoth proportions. Concrete is perhaps the most commonly used building material in the world. With a bit of tweaking, it could help to power our homes too. The common electric vehicle doesn't need to hit lightning speed – but Formula E race cars could usher in a new era for all. A facility near the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik, is using innovative farming technology to grow algae. Scientists are preparing to drill into the rock of an Icelandic volcano to learn more about how volcanoes behave. Land use for food and agriculture around the world is putting pressure on climate and biodiversity. Noise and air pollution are major threats and EVs can therefore offer a promising solution. Heat is the most deadly extreme weather phenomenon and cities are seeking ways to cool their urban cores. These mechanical creatures lurk beneath the water's surface and power homes in the Faroe Islands. Giant ravines: Entire communities are disappearing because of an extreme form of soil erosion. The floating houses built to withstand typhoons and flooding in the Philippines. The world's largest direct air capture plant sucks CO2 from the air and deposits it underground. While wind electricity is clean, this green industry has a waste problem. Now there's a race to solve it. Tech-loving traveller Paul Carter visits a new kind of farm - one that has to be accessed via an airlock. How a project near Fukushima has become a lab for demonstrating sustainable ideas for Japan and the wider world. One company is developing a new way of transferring energy from sea to shore, and it's all powered by the wind. A day in the life of the Black Mambas. To sustain an ever growing global population, we need to produce more food. A Mexican community has found an unusual way to protect their coral reef. As well as being a superb wine stopper, cork is a unique and versatile material. Nuclear waste remains toxic for thousands of years. How do you build a storage facility that will keep it safely buried for millennia? The event at Wolsingham School is postponed until the summer term after concerns from parents. UK households throw away an estimated 90 billion pieces of plastic packaging annually. HUID wants to change that. In the 1920s, Los Angeles officials built miles of sandy beaches to attract tourists to their city. A century later, ecologists try to bring wildlife back to those barren beaches. The creatures are named Ziggy, Whizzy, Lizzy, Lissard, Lenny, Fizzy and Blizzard. Earthships are designed to withstand the extreme temperatures of a desert, such as that around Taos, where extreme weather runs from sub-zero in winter to sweltering in summer. Marine turtles spend almost their entire lives at sea – but little is known about the paths they take. Now, satellites are helping scientists map their movements. Alexandra Burch has won this year's Wool4School competition, which promotes the use of merino wool. From a horseback safari in Brazil to one of the marine world's most flamboyant sex shows, these wildlife encounters allow travellers to come face to face with animals. Copyright 2024 BBC.

    "news_content": "Fourteen years after the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, would we fare any better at cleaning up another huge oil spill? How much energy you can pack into a battery is one limit on how big an EV can get – but meet the EVs ditching batteries altogether to attain mammoth proportions. Concrete is perhaps the most commonly used building material in the world. With a bit of tweaking, it could help to power our homes too. A growing group of conscious consumers have found other strategies than flat-out boycotts to hold firms accountable. As ocean temperatures rise, women in Zanzibar turn to natural sea sponge farming to stay afloat. Old coal mines across the world are being dusted off and repurposed to heat homes, offices, and more. What if there was a more sustainable way to produce diamonds? Electric roads that charge vehicles as they drive could soon be a reality. Human-caused climate change made recent extreme weather events more intense and more likely, new analysis finds. The global arachnid trade is threatening the world's most famous spider species. And it's primarily driven by souvenir collectors. Forty-eight percent of the world went through at least one month of extreme drought in 2023. The TV presenter says the previous Tory administration was \"reckless\" to scale back climate policy. The world's largest icebergs break off the Antarctic ice sheet. As they drift and melt in the Southern Ocean, they create a unique environment around them. The government's advisers say faster action is needed but the UK has the tools to achieve this. Another dire temperature prediction but it has to be seen in context. Nature is in rapid decline but here are five ways to make positive change. Climate change and sea ice loss leaves polar bears exposed to more diseases, research suggests. Copyright 2024 BBC.

    "news_content": "Spain is enduring its worst flooding disaster in decades, with at least 95 people dead and dozens more missing. At least 95 people have died and more are missing after torrential rain caused devastating flash floods. Flash floods sparked by torrential rainfall have killed 95 people around Valencia, while dozens are still missing. Climate change had a role in making the storm that hit Spain more intense and deadly, say scientists As Florida has been hit by several devastating hurricanes, homes designed to withstand these extreme storms have gone through a serious test. The centre of a hurricane is the focus of its power. But for scientists and early-responders, it can also offer life-saving opportunities. Fueled by heat from ocean waters, hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones are sometimes known as nature’s steam engines. We need to know how they are changing. From harbouring flamingos in bathrooms to ensuring koalas' specialised foods, when hurricanes hit, zoos need contingency plans at the ready. Should rich countries and fossil fuel companies pay for the climate losses and damages they have caused? Spinning over water and land, these terrifying phenomena are more common than we might think Seismic imaging off the Pacific Coast could reveal where the next big earthquake might strike. How do they differ from the ocean? A geophysicist breaks it down for us. An asteroid is going to circle our planet for two months this autumn before going on its way. With storms occurring between 140 to 160 nights a year, it's no wonder the area is a world record holder. Qasa Alom meets a team conducting research on Alaska's changing environment. Although huge hailstones are still rare, there are signs that their frequency and size are increasing. Over 100 fires in one province alone have been burning under the Canadian snow at an unprecedented rate. A bus-sized satellite has become the latest piece to fall to Earth. How often does that happen? Freezing temperatures affect electric vehicles in two major ways. Watch to discover how and why. The black-necked cranes are a revered species across the Himalayas. Insects make up around 70% of all known species, but many are struggling. How can we protect them better? Antarctic researchers are warning of a runaway ice-albedo feedback loop. But what is it? New York is gradually sinking under its own weight. Can the city mitigate the situation? We visit Morocco’s vast concentrated solar power project. Where sharp images of cosmic objects can be seen 270 days a year. Storm Ashley brought high winds and rain to several parts of west and northern Scotland on Sunday Storm Ashley is expected to bring very high winds and rain, particularly affecting western areas on Sunday. Warnings in Cumbria, Devon and Cornwall are issued for winds gusting up to 60mph (97km/h) and rain. A yellow alert for high winds gusting up to 60 mph (97km/h) covers the whole of Scotland. Video shows tractors being overwhelmed by tall plumes of smoke as firefighters battled the blaze. River levels are rising and properties are expected to flood in several parts of Wales. Climate change is wreaking havoc on farmers in Nigeria. The state's governor says the spread of misinformation is also complicating relief efforts.

One team is on a mission to create 3D printed sea walls with environmental benefits. Want to gift sustainably, dress stylishly, and help the planet? Scraps might be the answer. Living a zero-waste life is great for the environment and your wallet. How does it work? Turkey’s bee populations are dwindling due to intense beekeeping practices and wildfires. Lara Lewington visits car manufacturer Bentley to find out how it is making the shift to electric. The small Danish Island of Ærø has been deemed the most sustainable European island of 2021.
