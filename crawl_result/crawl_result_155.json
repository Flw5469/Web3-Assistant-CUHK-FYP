The Relative Strength Index is around 55, hinting at growing momentum. The nearest resistance level is $0.4007. If ADA breaks through, it could climb to the next resistance at $0.4587, marking a potential gain of over 20%. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are close, suggesting a possible trend shift. Despite recent dips of 7% over the past week and nearly 16% this month, the market sentiment is turning bullish. With support holding at $0.2847, Cardano might be gearing up for a significant move upward in the anticipated altcoin season. XRP is trading between $0.4818 and $0.5559, showing signs of upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index is at 60.76, indicating positive sentiment among traders. The MACD level is in positive territory, suggesting potential for further gains.

Despite recent declines over the past week and month, with price changes of -5.60% and -12.20% respectively, XRP has gained 3.13% over six months. The alignment of these technical indicators points to a possible breakout soon, supporting the anticipation of an upcoming altcoin season and a global crypto bull run.
