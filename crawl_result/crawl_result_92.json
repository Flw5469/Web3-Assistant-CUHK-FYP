    "news_title": "4 Ethereum Rivals To Flip $1 to $1,000 As Crypto Bull Run is Back",
    "news_content": "SIRWIN Bets.io Ybets TRENDING TODAY Highlights Despite the initial setback, the crypto market regained its bullish momentum in late October as the Bitcoin price surged past $70,000 for the first time in 4 months. As the investors’ sentiment grew for a crypto bull run, these Ethereum rivals could show the potential to turn a $1 investment into $1000. The October end recovery has managed to restore the market sentiment for a potential bull run. As crypto investors seek assets that could deliver exponential returns, Ethereum rivals like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Toncoin (TON ), and Sui (SUI) are positioned as top picks, with the potential to transform a modest investment into substantial profit. Solana (SOL) is recognized as one of the fastest and most scalable platforms among Ethereum rivals, and it is known for its high throughput and low transaction costs. In October, theSolana price predictionshowcased a high-momentum rally from $133 to $183, registering a growth of 37%. Along with the price rally, the SOL’s active addresses surged from 3 Million to 5.7 Million high— a 90% increase— according to TheBlock. This growth indicates heightened user activity in the Solana blockchain, which could bolster a robust network and demand pressure. With sustained buying, theSOL pricecould breach the $185 barrier and conclude its 7-month consolation.  Among Ethereum Rivals, the Cardano coin is viewed as an underperforming asset due to a consistent downtrend since August 2021. However, as no trend remains the same in a tradable asset, the ADA price shows a huge upside potential. According tosantimentdata, the Cardano large holders with 100 Million to 1Billion coins balance have increased their accumulation from 2.06 to 2.8 Billion ADA since April 2024. Generally, the whale accumulation coincides with major market bottom accounts for ADA’s potential for a major reversal. By press time, theADA pricetrades at $0.35 while holding a market cap of $12.38 Billion. Amid thecrypto market today, the Toncoin price records a 0.8% fall to trade at $4.98 while maintaining a market cap of $12.7 Billion. The momentum could plunge the asset 7.8% down to hit the $4.6 level, a support that has defended TON buyers since March 2024. Moreover, the Toncoin supply on exchanges has significantly reduced from its September high of 2.56 million coins to the current 1.73 million. This 32% reduction in exchange-held Toncoin indicates a shift toward long-term holding, as fewer coins are available for immediate trading or liquidation. Thus, the reduced selling pressure indicates the TON price is better positioned for a bullish reversal than a support breakdown. In the last three days, the SUI price showcased a notable reversal from $1.59 to $1.98, registering a 24% growth. This bullish rebound off the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level and the 50-day exponential moving average suggest a healthy correction, helping to renew the previously waning bullish momentum. An analysis of a 4-hour chart shows this recovery breaches the resistance trendline of a bull-flag pattern. If the pattern holds true, the SUI price willdrive a rally past $5. While the crypto market remains volatile, these Ethereum rivals— Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Toncoin (TON ), and Sui (SUI) — have positioned themselves as strong contenders in the blockchain space. If a crypto bull run emerges, these projects may offer substantial returns driven by their innovative technologies and expanding ecosystems.
