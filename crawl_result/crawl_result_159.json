Anybody in the community will be able to initiate a proposal with a small ADA deposit, which will be refunded after voting ends. Â The proposal will go through a voting procedure with DReps and SPOs to verify that the results match the Cardano community's vision. Another update to be expected is Treasury Withdrawal. To carry out the approved governance actions, a treasury withdrawal system will be deployed. Approved governance actions will receive funding allocated directly from Cardanoâ€™s treasury. This system will allow community members to shape treasury funds, promoting the Cardano network's long-term growth. Tomiwabold is a cryptocurrency analyst and an experienced technical analyst.
