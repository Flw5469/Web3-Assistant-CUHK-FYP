    "news_title": "Cardano's downturn vs Dogecoin's resurgence – Who will hit $1 first? - AMBCrypto",
    "news_content": "Despite being established players, Cardano and Dogecoin still trade below $1, falling short on real utility.  The quest for the elusive $1 mark is a classic narrative in the cryptocurrency landscape. Among the contenders, established names likeCardano [ADA]andDogecoin [DOGE]continue to hover below this threshold. While ADA has previously reached this range, DOGE has been far from it, despite high-profile endorsements. This raises the question : who will claim the coveted mark first? ADA’s recent price trends suggest potential further declines, particularly with a bearish MACD crossover emerging on the daily chart – an early signal of a possible trend reversal.  The price has recently tested a crucial support level at $0.3261, aligning with the 100% Fibonacci retracement level. If this support fails, ADA could slide to around $0.319. For Cardano to regain bullish momentum, it must rally past $0.37, but current market sentiment shows insufficient buying pressure. Source : IntoTheBlock A recent AMBCryptoreporthighlights that Cardano is experiencing swings in the derivatives market, with traders opting to short ADA – an understandable move given its current standing. With nearly 80% of ADA holders at a net loss, the lack of bullish support could undermine their confidence, potentially triggering a selling spree. However, if ADA captures election liquidity and rises to $0.35, around 120K addresses holding approximately 2 billion ADA tokens may seek to liquidate their holdings after securing profits. In summary, Cardano’s performance is closely tied to macroeconomic factors that could push BTC past $70K, potentially attracting liquidity away from BTC into ADA. Nonetheless, the long-term outlook for ADA appears more bearish, diminishing its prospects of reaching $1 in the near term. In another AMBCryptoreport, it was revealed that DOGE is breaking out of a descending channel, with key metrics turning bullish and a notable spike in open interest supporting the move. Conclusively, the short-term outlook for DOGE appears bullish, with a potential rally to $0.148, a historically significant resistance level. In the previous cycle, Dogecoin outperformed many of its counterparts, maintaining strength even as cat-themed tokens gained popularity. This suggests that, despite the growth in the memecoin market, Dogecoin’s strong legacy positions it as a more formidable contender than Cardano. However, concerns loom over DOGE’s long-term prospects. While it outperforms ADA across various timeframes, the growing pressure from other coins cannot be ignored. Source : CoinMarketCap Notably, two newer memecoins, POPCAT and WIF – one eight years younger and the other ten years younger than Dogecoin – have both claimed the $1 mark in under five years, with POPCAT even outpacing major memecoins with weekly gains exceeding 10%. ReadDogecoin’s [DOGE] Price Prediction: 2024-2025 In short, while Dogecoin has solidified its status as a legacy meme coin, it lacks genuine utility. In contrast, the newly launched memecoinGOATcould potentially hit $1 by the end of Q4, boasting a weekly surge of over 80% and nearing a $1 billion market cap. Overall, as Cardano and Dogecoin navigate bearish waters, newer coins like POPCAT and GOAT are emerging as frontrunners, complicating their paths to reaching the $1 mark.
