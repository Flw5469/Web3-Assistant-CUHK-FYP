https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/x79gnu/what_is_the_advantage_of_decentralized_storage/,What is the advantage of decentralized storage over centralized storage?,"I don’t get the fuss over decentralized infrastructures. Take storage… as a company, I’d rather trust a big corporation to store my data than a decentralized solution involving several smaller little-known entities to store them. I guess I’m missing something here?
Comment 1
Content: I get your point, but there remains a critical flaw in this way of thinking. No matter how big the data storage solution is, it still remains vulnerable to attacks. The issue with relying on such a solution is that attackers \*only\* have to break the defences of one data storage entity to compromise it. Decentralized solutions work differently. To put it simply: data is encrypted and stored across several locations. If you’ve hung around Crypto Twitter (CT), you might have witnessed a huge number of cyber attacks on crypto protocols. In 2021 only protocols have lost billions of dollars in hacks & scam. This is why it’s important for web3 apps to build on decentralized infrastructures such as Point Network that facilitate storing data on decentralized storage solutions. If you need additional reasons for going for decentralization, consider that centralized entities can decide to halt providing services any time they want… Just look at what happened to the Parler app last year, and you’ll understand that centralized entities have become way bigger than we should have let them.


Comment 2
Content: Some auto companies has been exploring blockchain and how it will benefit them better than centralized systems. BMW has tested blockchain to track the mileage of leased vehicles. They also in collaboration with GM explore sharing of self-driving cars data.Andre Luckow, blockchain lead at BMW Group, told CoinDesk:*“With the advent of blockchain, decentralized data management can be implemented in a privacy-preserving and efficient way. Further, emerging technologies, such as decentral machine learning, secure multi-party confidential computing, and decentral data markets, will provide the fabric for data processing in the autonomous age.”*Sebastien Henot, head of business innovation at the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance Innovation Lab in the Silicon Valley (who chairs MOBI’s vehicle identity working group). He told CoinDesk:*“The old fashioned way is that everybody thinks their data alone is so precious. The new way is to consider data sets like cooking ingredients: you need to be able to mix multiple ones to create something really valuable. Data marketplaces call technically for blockchain because you can create an environment where rules are clear in terms of who shares what data with who.”*They'll be exploring this through Ocean Protocol, which is also a member of MOBI.


Comment 3
Content: Because the attacker only need to infiltrate one storage facility compare that to decentralized storage where even if one storage point is compromised, you have other facilities to fact check the data and use as a reference to restore the compromised one.


Comment 4
Content: Storage on the decentralized platform is secure and everlasting. It also does not necessitate a large investment in data centers, making it less expensive than centralized storage solutions. Controlling and storing functions are simple, especially when employing storage platforms such as OCEAN, FIL, and AR.


Comment 5
Content: The protocols for decentralized storage generally make it easy for smaller providers to provide a good service. IPFS is an easy one to play with if you're interested in learning more.


Comment 6
Content: Consider the benefits of a single centralised database. Just a single MySQL or MariaDB server hosting all your data. What metrics could you measure it by?- speed- security- resistance to failure- capacityA single server will be our reference point, so let's say it scores 1 unit on all of these categories. The scale is entirely arbitrary but will be useful as a benchmark.Now, presume we have two identical servers running in parallel that somehow synchronise with each other. In that case, we compromise a bit on speed, since we are using some amount of time to synchronise, and you cannot process at a speed greater than 1 unit, because in that case, they will never be able to catch up and synchronise. In addition, you also compromise on capacity, since you are using (and paying for!) enough disk space to store 2 units, but you can only store 1 unit (maybe even less due to synchronisation overhead) because you have one copy of the same data on each server. You do, however, have a system that is twice as reliable, since two servers need to crash for your system to go down, instead of just one.Now consider four servers. The speed goes down a little bit again due to synchronisation overhead, but maybe not as much of a penalty as going from 1 server to 2 servers. Capacity also decreases from ½ to ¼, since you are now maintaining four copies of the same data. But now, your system is extremely reliable, and it's unlikely that it's going to ever go down if your four servers are located around the world. You also get an increase in security, since if the data on one server is tampered with, it becomes immediately obvious since the other three won't agree with it. An adversary would need to tamper with the data on at least two servers now to confuse the system.A blockchain is like scaling this system to a million servers. Eventually, the penalty for adding new servers in terms of cost to speed bottoms out. The blockchain *is* a way to synchronise unlimited servers with each other. It's also impossible to tamper with. Nobody can modify the data on one, ten, or even a hundred thousand servers without it being rejected overall by the remaining 900,000. You also get a benefit where every action is cryptographically signed, but that is not an intrinsic benefit of the blockchain. Rather, every cryptocurrency has just independently found it useful to implement such a feature.The downsides remain the same. The Ethereum network is only capable of handling around ten transactions per second, an abysmal speed compared to a single MySQL server which can execute thousands of queries a second even on unimpressive hardware. Additionally, every Ethereum node maintainer keeps a 300+ GB copy of the blockchain, which actually only ends up containing maybe around 50 GB of actual data if it was stored in an optimally efficient manner, without a blockchain. So at the end of the day, you have 300+ PB of hard disk space around the world being used to store duplicate data. But since every node maintainer pays their own costs, the pain is spread so widely that it really doesn't matter as much.Edit: There is also a downside specific to Ethereum and cryptocurrency blockchains. The network charges you a fee (gas fee) to modify the data, and this can cost into the order of several dollars per update. Even at its cheapest on side chains, it's still upwards of a penny per dozen or so updates. That's hellishly expensive compared to centralised solutions.


Comment 7
Content: company can easily ban you and delete all your content.


Comment 8
Content: It all boils down to the fact that you don't own your data and you cannot really guarantee privacy. What decentralization of data tries to solve majorly is ownership of data and privacy.


Comment 9
Content: It seems important to me to be able to remove one entity's ability to arbitrarily remove, alter or restrict your content(or literal property when you consider banks in Canada freezing the assets of the protesters they disagreed with.) based on their individual beliefs or ideology.


Comment 10
Content: Interesting question... I'd say as everything it will always depend on the cost of A VS B, but let's say it was the same. A company, lets say AWS or Microsoft could be a solid and reliable cloud solution, however it'd would have many less points of failure compared to it's decentralised alternative, lets say FileCoin, but the truth is that none of the options would have solid redundancy, I'd go with the centralised option, and if the redundancy would be solid I'd go with the decentralised option as it's probably more likely to have a failure on 10 machines than on 1000 at the same time. I'd also raise one flag about transparency on both options because data must be guaranteed that's not corrupted nor tampered. Oracles like DIA do it on data feeds, so if all the storage would be done on chain, that would be unmutable, which probably would give one extra point to the decentralised option!

Comment 1
Content: Just like every emerging trend/tech, Web3 is still at it's infancy but that's not to undermine the insanely amount of progress already made by projects like ETH, The Graph, OCEAN Protocol, FIL and so on.Funnily Jack Dorsey has been promoting Web5 ahead of Web3 but I have to say that Web3 is here to stay.


Comment 2
Content: Its future will be an immersive internet on top of the blockchain fully decentralized. I'm hodling various projects direct or inderectly related to Web3 like HNT, QTZ, SAND and MANA. I believe Web3 is closely related to other trends like Metaverse. Since there can't be an open Metaverse without dynamic NFTs, they are all interconnected somehow. Web2 is a huge limitation for next-gen technology.


Comment 3
Content: Web3 as a decentralized internet infrastructure will be widely adopted, as it will provide many benefits. I believe that projects that contribute to the development of the web3 concept, such as the OCEAN and DIA projects, will gain even more attention.


Comment 4
Content: I had the same doubts! I’ve seen a lot of web3 projects fall apart and some of them were not 100% secure. But I think the reason behind that is that they were not fully decentralized, they still used centralized domains, storage, and stuff that make cyberattacks pretty easy. Out of the countless projects there, I am bullish on Point Network. It’s a fully decentralized network that plans to decentralize the whole Internet. I really like how transparent these guys are. I am excited about all of their upcoming flagship dApps. I can already imagine the web3 future with such a network...


Comment 5
Content: I recently got to know that a defi project called Xdao serves as a Framework tool to create a DAO in just a few clicks. But the main focus is that they are intended to raise a new generation of people who will work in Web3 and will not need to go to offices at all to assist that they recently ran ambassador program where 40 of the community members were selected in and are learning and getting knowledge on web3, social media platforms where crypto is prevalent.

Comment 1
Content: Blockchain alone is not enough, yes I agree, It’s a matter of full decentralization I believe. Take for example BadgerDAO, this was supposed to be a very safe Dapp but got hacked because not all of its tech stack was decentralized. Bit confusing!I am currently following Point Network in that regard, a fully decentralized network. They claim to be the first network that decentralizes everything, and they don’t allow you to open any centralized domain on their [Point browser](https://pointnetwork.io/), like your Facebook and stuff. So bullish on this project, hopefully, this would be resistant to censorship and make the internet more secure for all of us.

Content: Why would you describe Flux as being “decentralized web3 infrastructure” when so much of it is hosted with a single hosting provider in Germany, presumably with a decent proportion of that on VPS hosting? That provider could wipe out almost half of the nodes instantly if they wanted to. Likewise, 60% of the nodes are in a single country, which is terrible for censorship resistance.There are quite a few cool things about Flux, but its faux-decentralised infrastructure and, unless I’m missing something, apparent lack of real-world use (the list of running dApps is really short and of dubious quality) are red flags for me. The toxic community on Twitter is another.

There are several uses of Web3 which includes:1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Web3 is being used to develop decentralized finance applications that offer financial services without the need for intermediaries like banks. All DeFi projects belong here. 2. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Web3 is enabling the creation and trading of third generation NFTs, i.e. composable NFTs. An example of a project doing this is Fusion by Metaplex. 3. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Web3 is facilitating the creation of DAOs, which are organizations that are run by code and governed by their members. This enables decentralized decision-making and eliminates the need for traditional corporate structures. E.g. MakerDao, PhoenixDao etc.4. Crypto Payment: The existence of Web3 tech now made it possible for payments on blockchain to include NFTs and metaverse assets among the list of options (in addition to cryptocurrencies) to redeem payment. CryptMi is a project that belongs here. I see this as the most important use for web3, cus bill payment cuts across the daily life of human beings. 5. Identity and Data Management: Web3 is being used to create decentralized identity solutions that give users more control over their personal data and privacy. See EverestID.Would like to know your take on the use cases for Web3 tech and which one you think is the most pivotal.
Comment 1
Content: The biggest use case of web3 is IMO, trust less self executing contracts.It'll make a lot of things that are more sensitive and personal, automated with no human interaction ever.This paired with Zero Knowledge proofs would be huge for privacy and digital safety.


Comment 2
Content: I'm not sure if there is a winner. I'm seeing good projects working on each one of these use cases. Crypto payments (Utrust), DAO (Diadata), NFT (Axie), and DeFi (Curve). I'm not familiar with EverestID yet, but I'll take a look. No doubt that Identity and Data Management is a strategic field. What makes Web3 so important is the combination of each one of these use cases, not a particular one.


Comment 3
Content: Ownership of your information while navigating the web. What you have listed are applications of this principle, but the main difference between web2 and web3 is ownership. Your data, your funds, your content.


Comment 4
Content: It's hard to pick one as all the use cases are important for Web3. The one I find intriguing is using blockchain to make connectivity accessible to everyone by decentralizing the telecom supply chain. Weaver Labs is making this possible.


Comment 5
Content: All of the mentioned uses are crucial and deeply intertwined within the context of web3. However, the significance of identity and data cannot be overstated as they form the backbone of the web3 ecosystem. Thus, effectively managing and securing these components is of utmost importance.


Comment 6
Content: A blockchain is a tool for solving serious industry problems. I've always been interested in seeing how this will produce more effective IoT systems. Weaver Labs has taken on Telecoms in that regard.Using smart contracts and blockchain in the Telecoms supply chain can bring efficient and secure transactions, streamline the exchange process, increase transparency, track assets and reduce the need for middlemen, lowering costs and potentially revolutionizing the management and governance of the Telecoms supply chain. Closely watching as they implement this.

There are interesting DAO structures such as mentioned MakerDAO but DIA whose DAO activity and DAO episodes are interesting. I think all these aspects play an important role in mass adoption.

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/1dywtzp/depin_sector_the_next_big_thing_after_bitcoin/,DePIN Sector: The Next Big Thing After Bitcoin?,"I've been diving deep into the DePIN sector lately and came across an interesting thesis that compared Bitcoin to the emerging DePIN projects. It got me thinking: Bitcoin was essentially the first decentralized physical infrastructure network using a token. Now, we’re seeing a surge in similar projects that could mirror its success.For instance, I'm particularly bullish on projects like IoTeX, Silencio, and the posemesh. These projects are leveraging decentralized networks to solve real-world problems, just as Bitcoin did for decentralized finance.IoTeX is creating a decentralized platform for the Internet of Things (IoT), providing secure interaction between devices. Silencio focuses on measuring noise pollution around us while the posemesh is developing tools to help AI gain spatial awareness.These projects, much like Bitcoin, are harnessing the power of decentralization to create more resilient, secure, and efficient systems. As we move forward, I believe the DePIN sector will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of technology and infrastructure. Is anyone else keeping an eye on these or other DePIN projects?
Comment 1
Content: There are two great DePIN projects that I know of one is going live currently called [Neuron ](https://www.neuron.world/)https://www.neuron.world/. They are working with aviation to start with and then will move into the IoT. The second is Sealsq Corp. They have already launched 5 or so satellites and this fall will launch another batch. Both use Hedera for their DLT. SealCorp is a publicly traded stock LAES. They are both worth reviewing. #

Comment 3
Content: Sure! another sector to keep an eye on are oracles, particularly with the newgen solutions like Pyth or Supra (which his now a vertically integrated L1).


Comment 4
Content: World Mobile is another great project you should check out.


Comment 5
Content: Some time ago I researched about Qualoo, enhancing performance & reducing telecom costs. Utilizing DePIN with crowd-sourced infrastructure, AI, and advanced analytics, Qualoo optimizes internet diagnostics and stability. I think this one has real-world traction, working already in a few ASEAN countries & having significant metrics in telecom improvements. This is the kind of DePin market needs


Comment 6
Content: Just to get the ball rolling, as someone working in web3, I want to understand why DePIN is pointing to anything different to what exists in web3 already. As OP points out, Bitcoin can be seen as a payments infrastructure. Anything connected to smartphones is essentially of the same physicality as any device, such as a noise pollution sensor, hooked up to a decentralized protocol node. I’m curious to learn more, and I do think that framing web3 protocols as a kind of infrastructure helps people understand what web3 is about, but for now I’m struggling to see how “DePIN” isn’t just more decentralized digitization of assets.


Comment 7
Content: The comparison between Bitcoin and DePIN ecosystem is quite new to me but i also agree that the DePIN ecosystem looks quite promising and a couple of projects like Hydro Online has been on my radar for a bit.


Comment 8
Content: how can i get involved with this


Comment 9

I thought I could ask some questions about app chains and their meaning for the future of web3. It seems to me like the future of web3 is going to be determined by interoperability between projects. There are so many different chains and mechanisms that it will be necessary to allow for easy cross-comaptibility, and this seems like a space that could be useful/lucrative to enter. Im super bullish on NEAR with investments and the only real example I know of this tech is appchains supported on the Octopus Network. Appchains built on Octopus are compatible with NEAR, ethereum and IBC blockchains which gives projects in web3 the potential to reach a wider audience. I want to know what other networks or protocols offer interoperability as cornerstones of their design, or if anyone thinks Im totally off base. There are also reasons to think that single blockchains could rise above all others and dominate the industry. Any and all feedback appreciated!

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/rvvol8/some_thoughts_on_business_models_for_web3/,Some thoughts on business models for web3,"**Web 3 isn't business as usual.** On the contrary, Web 3 will spawn entire new types of businesses, all because of 3 fundamental truths.* Everything is tradable* Customers are investors* Governance is programmable**Everything is tradable.**Anything can be priced and traded against anything else. Exchange your u/BoredApeYC for a house or a college degree, exchange your game item for an airline ticket.**Customers are investors.**Web 3 is community first. You don't build a product for a market, you build consensus around an idea in collaboration with the customers/users. The customers are rewarded with tokens/ownership for their early support and participation...**Governance is programmable**Countries, organisations and individuals all organize rules and the ability to enforce them. Web 3 makes the ability to organize and enforce much more granular by making everything that can be computed a potential law.So why is that a big deal?...Because compared to the old world where that is very expensive, slow and difficult. DAO's are regulation, voting, and enforcement in a box. Any idea you have can be governed through consensus allowing for completely new ways of organizing. &#x200B;Lets look at a few examples:**Funding for game development**A group of game developers pitch the game they want to build and what it will cost them.* They offer tokens as avatars in the game for those who want to support the development of the game, let's say 10000 for $100 each which provides $1million...* The $1M will be divided and unlocked in stages. * Proof of concept * Alpha * Beta * Launch* Each stage met successfully will unlock funds for next stage.* The token holders vote to unlock each stage.* If there is no consensus to move forward the reaming funds will be returned. Or...* If the token holders vote on continuing and unlocking the next phase and you voted against it you can try and sell your token to someone who believes in the project.This level of fluidity is unprecedented and allow anyone to be an investor, co-creator and gamer simultaneously.&#x200B;**ACME Clothing Brand Launch*** ACME NFT will serve as a lifetime pass for ACME clothes. * 1000 NFTs ever will be minted. You will receive clothing for each new season as long as you hold the token. * The value of the token increase with the increase in the brand value* You got some friends who like your hoodie? No problem. Just print a few more at a discount and sell or give it to them. It's your brand. You own the rights to it as long as you keep the token.* Each new seasons clothing line will be voted by the 1000 token holder consensus...* Don't agree with the new clothing line coming out? Saw another brand you like better? Sell your token to someone else on OpenSea and make someone else the new co-owner/creator of the now popular clothing brand.&#x200B;**Multi-company cross promotion**3 different companies is doing cross promotion. They offer 20% discount if you buy from all 3.* One is selling sneakers the other is selling trainers, the third is selling socks. The first place the customers buys a product they mint a token...* 13/ The second place they go to, they show their token when they buy the product and it gets added to the NFT which now have two purchases on record.* The third purchase unlocks the discount. The campaign revenue & rules are held in the DAO and unlocked once campaign is over.Completely unrealistic in most current scenarios.With Web3, companies can collaborate without trusting each other because the rules are written into the DAO and can't be coerced or changed once agreed upon.To take this even further. The relationship between everyone is completely rewritten. There is no practical limits to how and who you can connect with and creating meaningful relationships.If it can be programmed it can be governed.Thoughts?

Comment 1
Content: My career began when the internet was brand new, and all I can see from the Metaverse crowd is a repeat of cycles that have already come through. P2P broke the world. It's the reason we have Spotify now. Decentralization was the magic bullet, but it's slow and comes with its own pitfalls. Now everybody's losing their mind about blockchain, and I get it, because it's a new an improved version of the same thing that we've already had. Decentraland is a worse version of Second Life, which is a worse version of most 3D games, but they gave you the ability to purchase and sell REAL digital assets with their currency, the Linden Dollar.Anyway, yes to this meme. It's exciting that tech continues to evolve. However, if you think that we're in store for a whole new world simply because we've figured out how to combine cloud hosting with decentralization, I'm afraid you'll find that the future looks a lot like the past.

Taylor Monahan, global product lead at MetaMask, told Blockworks that gaming is one of the most popular use cases on the wallet and has been since 2020. “With the pandemic, MetaMask has seen exponential growth in play-and-earn gaming, especially in the APAC \[Asia-Pacific\] region,” Monahan said. Even so, a recent study by CodaLabs revealed that traditional gamers, on the whole, aren’t fans of crypto or NFTs — and rated their feelings toward the industry at an average of 4.4 out of 10. Only 15% of gamers who haven’t played a Web3 title showed interest in blockchain-based games. Games like Axie Infinity, CosmoGene, and recent projects like LifeBeyond have led GameFi to great heights which is certain to continue. The biggest hesitation around crypto gaming came from concerns about scams and the cost of Web3 gaming. Monahan is still bullish, though, saying the partnership ought to enable an “even smoother user experience” designed to make possible “full interoperability for Web3 games.”

It remains to be seen whether it is useful to the general public.It's always been a truism in Silicon Valley that if you want to know where the next big ideas will come from, look where the money and smart developers are going. There has been no shortage of funds in the case of Web3. Only a few developers, on the other hand, have decided to jump on this bandwagon. Tea, a web 3 tool, was created by a number of well-known developers, including the creators of the homebrew tool.Code-enforced contracts are possible with smart contracts. Digital assets can be owned using blockchain technology. In the world of finance, this is a game changer. Gaming assets are one example I'll use that people might be able to understand. You can work hard for items in a WoW game, putting in a lot of time and effort, but if Blizzard decides to ban your account for some arbitrary reason, you'll be out of luck. You don't have any rights to them. The blockchain enables you to truly own these items. Blizzard will not be able to take them away from you. On the blockchain, there are even assets that can be used in a variety of games.They don't care what game they're playing. Before you say it won't catch on, keep in mind that it already has. These games are simple and entertaining, but it is an exciting space that is constantly evolving.TL;DR: Blockchain isn't attempting to take the place of MySQL. It aims to eliminate counter-party risk by allowing digital ownership of all digital assets. Take that in any way you want.
Comment 1
Content: There's going to be a place for it, but it's not going to replace Web 2.0. I actually hate that it's called Web3 as it implies that it's an evolution of the internet, where it's more likely going to run parallel to current technologies. There's a need for both centralization and decentralization.


Comment 2
Content: I don't think web3 is overhyped my friend. This is the future of the internet, but the thing is that web3 is yet to reach its full potential. It's still in its earliest days, and it'll definitely be improving, especially when there are driving forces like Matic working endlessly to upgrade web3 scene day in day out.

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/13m0nvs/the_potential_of_nonfungible_equity/,The Potential of Non-Fungible Equity,"One of the major challenges facing DeFi is the issue of overcollateralization and illiquidity. As we look for innovative solutions, one concept that has caught my attention is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). This approach has the potential to revolutionize DeFi by addressing these pressing issues.Within the realm of tokenizing real-world assets, there are several projects worth exploring, including mnicorp, Polytrade, realionetwork, and many others. These projects introduce novel models and approaches to incentivize user participation and tap into the untapped potential of tokenizing assets.However, let's shift our focus to the fascinating concept of Non-Fungible Equity (NFE) and its role in bridging traditional businesses into the digital portfolio of DeFi.NFE offers an inclusive opportunity for users to invest in a diverse range of real-world assets. With NFE, the traditional barriers of illiquidity and limited access are shattered, providing increased liquidity and broader investor participation. This groundbreaking approach allows users to stake on a variety of RWA projects that are chosen and funded by the community itself, ensuring sustainability and reducing concerns about liquidity.The transparency and resilience of NFE in a decentralized environment make it a powerful tool in shaping the future of DeFi. By embracing NFE and exploring tokenization of real-world assets, we unlock numerous benefits, including improved transparency, reduced transaction costs, and wider access for investors.Let's dive deeper into the potential implications and opportunities that arise from tokenizing real-world assets and harnessing the power of Non-Fungible Equity in the DeFi landscape.
Comment 1
Content: The tokenization of RWAs in DeFi is one of the narratives that opens up more opportunities for blockchain in future because that's the only way we can have traditional assets on chain for easy manipulation. Really got interested in this topic after I saw Allianceblock partnership with ABO digital for tokenization of RWAs. This is the first time I'm coming across NFE and will have to explore that one next.


Comment 2
Content: The tokenization of real-world assets and the emergence of Non-Fungible Equity hold immense transformative potential for DeFi. These approaches offer solutions to liquidity and overcollateralization challenges as mentioned above, while also promoting broader access, transparency, and increased liquidity. Their integration has the power to reshape and revolutionize the decentralized finance landscape.

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/v19fgm/the_rise_of_web3_what_cybersecurity_concerns/,The Rise Of Web3: What Cybersecurity Concerns Should We Look Out For?,"Web3 is a slang name for the future generation of the internet, which includes cryptocurrency, decentralized networks, the blockchain, and other technologies. While the concept of Web3 may appear to many as a far-off, future concept, the truth is that it is far closer than we realize, with many features already firmly embedded in the public awareness. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)—virtual money backed and issued by a central bank—have previously been created in nine nations. What concerns should we look for?Cryptojacking It doesn't take long for cybercriminals to jump on the bandwagon, as it does with all popular trends. RAV researchers revealed 2021 was ""the year of the miner"" in Reason Labs' State of Consumer Cybersecurity report. The number of crypto miners distributed throughout 2021 was enormous, accounting for nearly 60% of all Trojan activity detected last year. It's a threat that, while it may not harm a user's device like traditional malware, will directly affect a user's pocketbook—your electric bill may skyrocket as crypto coins are harvested without your consent. Projects like Concordium have paved the way by ensuring that while users enjoy safety and privacy of transactions, it is possible to be used for police report when the need be.Vulnerabilities in Blockchain There are legitimate security concerns with digital currency. The cryptocurrency blockchain, contrary to popular belief, is not an impenetrable force. It is secure when you or trusted sources operate the majority of a blockchain. However, if malicious miners control a simple majority of more than 51 percent of the blockchain, it breaks the chain, making it vulnerable to manipulation—and, worryingly, these so-called ""51 percent attacks"" are also on the rise. In 2020, bitcoin gold, a relatively minor cryptocurrency, was subjected to a 51 percent attack, resulting in the double-spending of over $72,000 in bitcoin gold tokens. And, just last month, the play-to-earn crypto game Axie Infinity was hacked to the tune of $625 million by hackers stealing from the underlying Ronin blockchain, raising the bar for crypto heists to shockingly high new heights Many in the cybersecurity industry would consider an event like this to be a learning experience, but it's a costly one!Phishing Attacks Phishing is another threat that is likely to infiltrate the Web3 domain. Phishing is not a new concept; however, the way it is used today is. In October 2021, attackers used phishing emails to steal cryptocurrency from 6,000 Coinbase customer accounts by exploiting a flaw in the company's two-factor SMS system. Another malicious example of this type of theft occurred in February, when $1.7 million in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were stolen in an OpenSea phishing attack. An attack that exploited a flaw in the Wyvern Protocol, the standard that underpins most NFTs, stole over 250 tokens. The Importance of Education This brings us back to a topic I've discussed before: the importance of cybersecurity education. How do you prevent phishing scams? What exactly does it mean to be cyber secure? How do you have complete faith in something? It is critical to teach customers how to ask and answer these questions.Learning to recognize suspicious signs will increase consumer awareness of the safety of their devices and data. Furthermore, next-generation antivirus (NGAV) and endpoint protection solutions are required. Attackers are constantly attempting to tip the scales of trust. To detect and eliminate new threats, we need to use a combination of the human brain, instinct, and AI machine learning.Unfortunately, the “freedom” and end-user ownership that Web3 will offer consumers is the same freedom that cybercriminals will also be able to enjoy. We need to find a solution whereby the vision of an autonomous web for all can be experienced, without opening up a huge can of worms.

People constantly requesting them or free NFT or they’re readily available when looking at artists on NFT provider sights. Is there a threat to having your address shared all over the place? Do you recommend having a secondary wallet for every coin type you hold, so that if someone buys my NFT for $0.01 worth of Tezos, I should transfer than out so buyers can’t then see how big (small actually) my bag is?

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/17qhzps/account_abstraction_wallet_is_evolving_so_fast_in/,Account Abstraction Wallet is evolving so fast in terms of development and Innovation.,"DeFi has always been in an ever-evolving landscape with the sole aim of enhancing the user experience, seamless transition and onboarding, security, and privacy. Based on my research, I'd say one of the key areas in this field is account abstraction. There has been a drastic shift and development in this area, scaling from the traditional wallet system we know to a more user-centric solution that has a lot of benefits for web3 users and also for web2 users that want to venture into web3. What Exactly is Account Abstraction? Account Abstraction is a methodology that can be applied to blockchain accounts to usher in greater adaptability, diversity, and security for users. This is achieved by harnessing the power of smart contract accounts, which offer advantages to externally owned accounts (EOAs). . This was initially introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and has gained widespread recognition and substantial community support, particularly through ERC-4337. It is currently regarded as a cutting-edge trend within the blockchain. Here are a few wallets currently implementing account abstraction: 1. Argent Argent is a user-friendly smart contract wallet emphasizing Layer 2 activities, tailored for cryptocurrency newcomers. It boasts social recovery, multi-signature capabilities, fee payments in stablecoins, and rapid batch transactions. Currently active on Ethereum Mainnet and Layer 2 solutions like zkSync and StarkNet. 2. ambire Ambire Wallet prioritizes user friendliness and security, serving both new and experienced users. It stands out with advanced features like batch transactions, multi-signature capabilities, and stablecoin fee payments across various blockchains. Their gas tank feature enables cost-effective transactions in preferred tokens. 3. Brillion This boasts a multitude of advanced features, such as the utilization of social logins, seamless bank integration, intermediary-free remittance payments, flexible withdrawals, and spending limits. It'll support the utilization of SSI offered by NexeraID, empower users to recover identities through MetaNFTs, establish rules for diverse wallet activities, embed compliance measures, and much more. But it is still in the open beta phase. There are many others, like Holdstation, Sequence, Safe, Bitkey, Bit Gate, and many more. Even MetaMask, from the look of things, is scaling to this type of wallet. From my research, I think all seem to have the same end goal or object, and all features are centered on enhancing the benefit, which is to simplify and enhance the user experience, enhanced security and privacy, cost efficiency, interoperability, and future-proofing. I think AA's ability to increase flexibility, interoperability, and user-friendliness opens the door to a multitude of innovative applications in Web 3.

I feel like there are true benefits to Web3:\- You don't feel powerless against a somewhat anonymous entity like fb or Google\- You may (!) have better and more convenient methods to contribute to a project, e.g., vote via token\- You may (!) save on middleman transaction fees&#x200B;However, I fully agree with much of the criticism (e.g., from Molly White) and think there are serious issues, which are often linked to fundamental misconceptions about how humans can organize themselves in groups:\- There is no real value in a non-community (hence centralized) Web3 project. It just makes developping so much more cumbersome\- Community projects are often based on intrinsic motivation and strong ethical beliefs of its members. You cannot replicate this with financial incentives. Adding financial incentives will completely change how people interact with the project.\- Without financial incentives, you run into these typical community problems like lack of leadership in times of disagreement, inefficiencies and instability over time especially when the project grows


Comment 3
Content: You still need the blockchain to be run by someone. The people with the most resources to mine will be the winners here. That doesn't change just because it's decentralized.Something blockchain supporters don't seem to understand is that cryptography isn't only a blockchain thing. Using cryptography you can hide things even though someone else has your data. You can verify ownership with your private key and signatures. This isn't exclusive or even new to block chain. Block chain just creates a public ledger for it to facilitate transactions. One that's really slow and expensive to maintain. No one's going to stand at the gas pump for a few minutes waiting for their block chain transactions to confirm before they pump gas. And somewhat hilariously all the solutions to that seem to be just another form of centralizing the transaction model 🤣🤣.

Unless you are a leech or dumb, the answer should be both.This is why it makes me so pissed when I see people invest millions of dollars and hype the living crap out of web3 projects that don’t improve their web2 counterparts. I saw an ad on Twitter for a web3 food delivery service startup. This is just saying “in addition to service fee, delivery fee and driver tip - our dApp also has gas fees and takes 20 minutes to verify a hash” Web3 is super easy to hype up but long term investments will collapse if no value is added to existing utilities.If you think I’m a pessimist or “unwilling to submit to web3” ask yourself why NFT’s and DeFi are pretty much the only features consistent across the different L1 blockchains.What everyone is underestimating is one of the original reasons web3 was innovated in the first place: gaming. If you live under a rock and don’t know the story: WoW debuffed one of Vitalik’s in game items, demonstrating to him “the horrors of centralized services” Tokenization of video game entities is one of the most intuitive uses of tokenization: giving a user immutable ownership of a digital asset. Linking video games, the metaverse, and NFTs could radically change the way we play games. It isn't an industry with high economic barriers to entry like social media, so it is realistic to see how blockchain tech is useful here.The determining factor for the adoption or rejection of blockchain tech in mainstream PC gaming is going to depend on choosing the correct L1 to build the platform on. Any in game economy requires quick transactions at a scalable level. Furthemore, a sustainable community of platform developers, game developers and players will require significant investment from the L1. Unfortunately, most blockchain foundations focus on investing in DeFi because it generates more investing users, aka more revenue.My pick for the L1 that will bring web3 into mainstream gaming is NEAR. With PoS and sharding it has the scalability and user-friendliness that L1’s like ETH or Cardano don’t have. Most of the gaming platforms were initially created over Ethereum blockchain but, after facing scalability and gas fee issues, they are leaving Ethereum. For example, that horse racing game that went viral on TikTok, Zed, has completed its move over to NEAR. More importantly, NEAR has been investing in gaming for a while now. Gaming platform developers OP Games, Inite and Vorto Gaming have all received 6 figure grants from NEAR. It was the place to be for gaming in 2021 and should continue to be into 2022.

It definitely doesn't matter in the sense that OP describes. Having your inventory as NFT won't save your from any balance changes in game unless somebody creates a copy of the game and lets you move your whole account.> Tokenization of video game entities is one of the most intuitive uses of tokenizationI don't think this is true at all. Read the thread about Ubisoft saying ""Gamers don't get NFT"" or the shitstorm Discord got for implementing NFT profile pictures. Pretty sure there is no group that is more hostile to NFTs than gamers. The understanding and reasoning why sounds also really limited. But theses threads are really not worth commenting on. Even carefully worded explanations of why NFT game items could have benefits are downvoted into oblivion. Instead people are defending the concept of centralised marketplaces by companies like Valve who already take plenty of fees. It's confusing.


Comment 3
Content: I was a web developer in the middle of the dotcom bubble. The one thing I learned from that fiasco is the companies that survived focused on providing a value or service to people and were run by people who believed in the product. The ones that failed focused on making money only which was most of them.The ironic thing is the ones who focused on making money did a great job of convincing themselves (and others) they ""believed"" in the product. They talked the talked about how their website or product was going to ""change the world"" or some other BS. I see this all the time in crypto/web3. People will post about how they ""believe"" in some cryptocurrency is going to ""free people"" or something when all they really care about is getting rich quick.

Content: Your pick is good. I have another pick though. QANplatform, a layer 1 built on PoR still on its testnet period which is going well, and the mainnet will be by Q3 this year.

My pick for L1 that will bring web3 to the mainstream is QANplatform.

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/16gfeil/exploring_the_future_of_decentralized/,Exploring the Future of Decentralized Infrastructure and Mobility,"Optimism abounds as we anticipate the potential acceptance of the BlackRock Spot ETF. Alongside this, I've been closely monitoring the DePIN narrative, which I'm confident will experience substantial growth. Various teams are already advancing the concept into areas such as mobility and digital twins, and they're poised to disrupt industries dominated by legacy names. So, if you're wondering, yes, it's time to get excited, and yes, you are an early participant in this exciting journey. In this context, my top picks are IoTeX, Solana, and peaqnetwork. I've heard that Solana is also gearing up to develop DePINs within its ecosystem, indicating the concept's increasing traction. The DePIN narrative is flourishing on Solana, with projects like Helium and Render migrating to it due to its speed and cost-effectiveness. Solana provides an ideal solution for developers seeking to build DePINs. IoTeX is the platform designed for DePIN builders, combining fast and secure blockchain technology with the Internet of Things. DePIN builders on IoTeX now have a built-in playground to deploy their proofs-of-concept and hardware in the real world, making a tangible impact on people's lives. The peaq network, serving as a layer-1 for DePIN, offers a great environment for building DePINs, capable of handling 10,000 transactions per second with ease. Scalability is not a concern, which is why the growing list of DePIN projects, including 2blox, is choosing peaq over Algorand. This shift underscores its immense potential. Peaq's recent partnership with moveIDgaiax is a significant step towards demonstrating the future of mobility. With the same identity, your car can now book a charging session and pay for a parking spot, all made possible through this innovative layer-1 blockchain. The presence of peaq-based Tesla and Jaguar rides, utilizing DePIN for parking and charging, at Europe's largest mobility fair is truly intriguing and not to be missed. Many DePIN enthusiasts have been acquiring Krest, a peaqnetwork Kusama parachain focused on simulating an Economy of Things network to position themselves for the upcoming Peaq airdrop. The ongoing IAA MOBILITY 2023 event in Munich is captivating, especially with live demos featuring Tesla and Jaguar cars powered by peaq. The prospect of experiencing peaq-based rides and using Web3 for parking and charging adds an exciting dimension to the event. With the increasing demand for decentralized infrastructure, more individuals and companies are showing interest in utilizing DePIN to construct their infrastructure networks.

Comment 1
Content: How tho? Anything related to real world transactions is still centralized, some countries banned crypto, more probably will in the future. You have to pay massive taxes to withdraw any kind of crypto so you can make actual use of it. Not against this goal, just being realistic. More and more privacy rights are being taken every day, the past couple of years were a huge step in the wrong direction, the majority of people don’t care and they won’t care until it’s going to be too late (it probably already is), we’re screwed.

I'll be writing briefly about three projects that caught my attention in this sector: Cartesi, Qanplatform, and Algorand.Cartesi is a huge player in the hyperpolyglot game, and I got to discover that it was among the pioneers. Its L2 solutions are also intriguing, offering more scalability and efficiency. If you've had hands-on experience building on Cartesi, I'd love to hear your thoughts.Qanplatform boasts a multi-programming language feature, liberating developers from being restricted to just Solidity. This could potentially streamline the development process and attract a broader range of developers, which is already happening.But that's not all, I also learned that Algorand is gearing up to add Python to its list of supported languages. And this is its first step into being a hyperpolyglot chain. Awesome right?Now, I'm curious to know if other projects are breaking free from the single-language mold. I would like to know about your experiences and recommendations.
Comment 1
Content: Yes, it's been that way by design. Pashto, Arabic, Mandarin, English, and Spanish should be the ones you are looking for: Americans learning Arabic to participate in open source is democracy at work!


Comment 2
Content: I knew about Cartesi and QAN, but I didn't know Algo was planning to go in the same direction. That's the definition of a developer-friendly project. That multi-programming feature sounds good in theory, but I am eager to see its effect in reality.


Comment 3
Content: Multilinual solutions might actually increase the rate of adoption in the crypto space because I read that QAN aims to use this method to onboard over 20 million developers which will be really huge.

What's the word for it? It's like a cultish mania. You get these endless charts about comparisons to the early internet etc. and they all seem to be copium. No one is doing this copium stuff for AI, it just works, why can’t we handle any criticism? Why can't we stop driving people away with words like FUD when they bring up real points? Honest question, what's driving this? I've never seen an industry which is so socially aggressive with innovation and adaption to reality and customers.
Comment 1
Content: You don't need to make any arguments about the power and efficacy of AI- just let anyone play with ChatGPT for five minutes and they'll quickly understand why it's a thing. Web3 is mostly about hype because without hype you're not seeing any reason why it's a thing.


Comment 2
Content: When I first started developing in crypto in 2014 one of the holy grails was to create a self custody crypto wallet that anyone, even my mother, could use. Nine years later and we still don't have a decent one. I don't think it's an impossible task to build one, just really hard.I think web3 is like that. The idea that cryptography, blockchains, p2p networks and other tech can help rearchitect the web to solve the privacy problems of web2 and generate new innovation is not dead but it's taking much longer than anyone thought. Is it overhyped? Yes, sure. Will it achieve any of the lofty goals? Nobody knows, but there's only one way to find out - buidl. I think the huge amount of R&D and passion for web3 going on across countless projects suggests its more than just hopium. There is progress being made and there are massive opportunities for innovation (yes, of an early internet scale), so we need to be patient and let devs, engineers and entrepreneurs work through the complexity of the technology and produce meaningful products. I find it massively exciting still.


Comment 3
Content: My opinion: Web3 is built on perceived profitability. That’s it. It feeds on people’s insecurities and poor critical reasoning. It makes them feel like everyone else is making money and if they miss the ride, they’ll lose out. Cryptocurrency is powerful, but does NOT need a use case. The power to issue a counterfeit-resistant currency is a godlike ability, but everyone is more concerned about how to hype up some unrelated use case, like decentralizing Twitter. People already love using Twitter without decentralization. People don’t use a service like Twitter because it’s decentralized, since it’s not part of the value proposition. Making it decentralized is fake value. Similarly, a technique of manipulation used is to change the hype cycle when a novel trend gets old. When web3 gets old, they’ll call it something else and everyone will get hyped again. It is manipulative and predatory in this exact way. The issuance of currency is enough. Currency is so powerful that the US dollar has religious mythology printed right on it—“in god we trust”—an all-seeing eye. We don’t need to replace the dollar, but we absolutely need alternative currencies to solve our social needs, like a currency that reduces global inflation. Put it another way. Let’s say you have this superpower, like the ability to fly. And after showing your trick, you get lost in your insecurity and feel like you need to show off a bunch of other skills to be accepted, so you start juggling and riding a unicycle and doing backflips. All very nice, but the flying is enough. Everything else is fake value, because there are plenty of other people who can juggle, and people are only watching you juggle because you can fly. Flying is enough. Similarly, currency is enough. We just don’t work on it hard enough, so you have thousands of nonsense currencies, and not a single serious alternative to the dollar. Not. One. But there could be. And it can change everything.

Remembering a password is a serious challenge.This study gives us a good look at how limited the average computer user really is: [www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/)26% couldn’t even use a computer. Only 5% could find out: “what percentage of the emails sent by John Smith last month were about sustainability.” Making your own bitcoin wallet is stratospheric compared to the hardest task they gave people and naturally limits the entire ecosystem to the top one percent of computer users.A great example of a recent migration to a centralized platform is the gamer population that moved from self hosted systems like team speak to discord.Every community manager knows that if you trust your community to another platform, you might lose it. It takes a lot to put that trust in a platform, but the ease of use slowly chipped away at the self hosted solutions.The reason people migrate to centralized platforms is because they’re a lot easier to use.The idea that we’re all going to use the Blockchain as a decentralized foundation to a future where we take control, fundamentally misunderstands people’s priorities, namely, ease of use.People generally don’t care about privacy outside of the tech niche. Even when they do, it’s very hard to compete with the centralized platforms, which has all of the other people that you want to connect with.Gamers are probably the most technologically savvy group of them all, and they took the longest to switch to hosted solutions, but they too, have switched and are unlikely to go back.So what’s the solution? Could it be the Fediverse (platforms like Mastodon)?I’d love to know your thoughts.
Comment 1
Content: There are a lot of things you're right about. The thing is that crypto != web3. Respectfully, I believe you are conflating web3, crypto, and blockchain. All these are different things. Web3 been co-opted by crypto shill, ponzi, and pump and dump schemes. This will not last, but I think what will happen is more like the creation of Linux or certain open-source ecosystems. There will be a tier of decentralized social media, cloud backup services, etc that put customer ownership at the center of it. Proper digital identity protocols do not need to rely on crypto-centric blockchains, the reason they do today is because it further enriches people who have bought into those paradigms and need others to buy in, too, in order to continue to pump the prices. I don't see how anything web3 will ever grow to the scale of FB without anti-trust action breaking them up.


Comment 2
Content: Until web3 solutions that’s meant to replace web2 applications are easier to use, it’s definitively a pipe dream until then.The general public don’t really care about decentralization and most web3 experiences are such a hassle to use.


Comment 3
Content: Web3 I think is more than just blockchain technology. It’s a business approach and philosophy as much as it’s a technology advancement. More transparency and influence by consumers and using consumers or community for marketing tactics and strategies in return for perks or benefits in the product or service.

Comment 7
Content: This does not sit well with me. This is being accomplished through some decentralized projects. I've seen how projects like OCEAN give people control over their data and IPs.


Comment 8
Content: Part of the theory is that there would be free-and-open-source solutions for the respective community management software, and people would be able to easily spin off their own version of it. All of the networking would be done, they would just change the name and so on, for their community. If they wanted to develop further their implementation, whatever changes they make could be done in such a way to be addable to the main software, improving it.Such instances of networked software could also be federable, so communities could be open to each other if the hosts choose it.For the end user in theory the user-friendliness should be identical. It shouldn't matter if they choose discord or some FOS software that is being self-hosted by some community manager, with skins and styling having been developed by another third party, because the end user experience should be the same.I think the community has failed to do that though. They have failed to build these solutions in ways that would take off. Now, I don't blame the people building the software, because the software is usually good, I more blame the lack of third party modders to take a good piece of softare, and find a way for they themselves to profit from implementing a change to it that increases user-friendliness.There are many many examples, but I can give one.Imagine decentralized exchanges versus centralized exchanges. If people are truly going to centralized exchanges just because they have a nicer user interface, then what stops someone from taking a decentralized exchange (proven secure), adding their own front-end, putting it up on a website, paying for marketing and advertising, and pocketing the difference in money in fees between what the not-that-profitable decentralized exchange makes and what the very-profitable centralized exchange makes?By doing so they would be increasing the usage of the decentralized exchange, so whatever profit they make would be earned until their features get brought into the core software, or the features can be not added and they can continue just profiting from the additional user interface features they brought in.That is with respect to exchanges, but it applies to everything else, this can be done with non-web3 federated software as well.

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/sph49i/isnt_it_time_for_developers_and_individuals_to/,"Isn’t it time for developers and individuals to join the internet revolution, Web3?","Web3 technology is exactly what we need right now and as I see it, mainstream tech companies are racing to adopt this technology that will benefit the average daily user. Developers are more than welcome to join this revolution, since platforms like Ocean Protocol allows them to build their own data wallets, data marketplaces, and more, through Ocean Libraries.Even gamers can take part through platforms like Citrus that aims to accelerate the transformation of gaming and provide solutions to the blockchain world by introducing next-gen DeFi ecosystem, valuable NFTs, user-friendly DApps and beyond.
Comment 1
Content: ""Mainstream tech companies are racing to adopt."" Do you have an example?


Comment 2
Content: The technology is stable enough .. the issue is that when it comes to mainstream adoption.. they've gotten very very complicated to have a ""landing"" And that's because the crypto game is cut throat .. Technologies come out every week it seems , trying to do what the previous ones did but better.The common average person doesn't know how to use it or even what to use. It's really complicated even to someone with technical knowledge. That's why it's not mainstream.


Comment 3
Content: It's been going on for a while now. Polkadot a web3 blockchain already has products like Unido an enterprise DeFi built on it which will help SMEs to easily navigate their way in the crypto-verse.


Comment 4
Content: Web3 is for everyone. Gamers, financial services, NFTs, just name it. The Ocean protocol is quite unique as it gives developers the flexibility to build their own data related projects. We are just getting started.


Comment 5
Content: Ocean is bullish for this reason!


Comment 6
Content: I've always been invested in the establishment of Web3 and I've always known that NFTs would play a major role in that, so seeing a scalable NFT blockchain that provides web3 solutions in Game, Art, Developer and Collection is a step towards the right direction.


Comment 7
Content: Web3 is inclusive


Comment 8
Content: Data libraries, if verified could be the new library of Alexandria! The future of Wikipedia! And even could be turned into NFTs, who knows?

Comment 9
Content: Web3 can really help when it comes to adoption, no question about it. You already mentioned OCEAN, I think that DIA is also a good project, Unique Network as well they are working on Web3 solutions for NFTs... We are definitely witnessing some changes in the game.


Comment 10

Comment 1
Content: Or, the NFT simply represents ownership in exactly the same way as a CD or a record does, and comes with the same rights. Maybe with a few added little extras like the ability to transfer it with the artist getting a cut


Comment 2
Content: There's an article about this on DEIP's Medium account. Or one of their pinned messages, I can't remember. But basically music based NFTs eliminate the middleman, so creators have more control over their songs etc.


Comment 3
Content: I don't think you put the music on the blockchain - that would be too expensive. Instead, you put a link to the music on the blockchain and that signifies ownership or something. Maybe there can be a smart contract that gives dividends to NFT owners? Not sure. Better ask in r/NFT.


Comment 4
Content: Quick reminder that music DRM was roundly rejected by the marketplace via iTunes. If you're serious, tell me why ""DRM on a blockchain"" will be received differently. Don't forget, if you want your DRM to mean anything, you need *restrictive* players/distribution platforms to enforce it.... otherwise, you still have the ""screenshot the jpeg"" problem. (If I sound salty, it's cause I've been working on versions of this problem for years. Not simple.)

On the pro side, I've been tuning into [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/2021/10/28/chris-dixon-naval-ravikant/) and [Kevin Rose](https://modern.finance/episodes/) who are excited about the possibilities for web3, mainly for artists and musicians. But I have a sense that this excitement feels a lot like the hype of ""get in on the ground floor and you can make some money"" kinda thing. I haven't been sold on it quite yet. They have that rosy optimism of youthful entrepreneurs seeing a new market and liberating the people from big tech.However, I am much more cynical and think this road leads us down the path of transhumanism and dystopian future. I find myself resonating more with critics like [Alison McDowell](https://youtu.be/6RuYaEeiCE8) ([Wrench in the Gears](https://wrenchinthegears.com/2021/10/07/blockchain-the-metaverse-and-nephele-mother-of-the-centaurs/)) [Tessa Lena](https://tessa.substack.com/p/great-reset-dummies), [Joseph Gonzalez](https://bantamjoe.com/blog-2/), and [Silicon Icarus](https://siliconicarus.org/) to name a few.

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/13rfaba/addressing_challenges_for_online_merchants/,Addressing Challenges for Online Merchants,"Cryptocurrencies have captured the world's attention, revolutionizing the way we transact. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Doge and Litecoin are just a few examples of digital currencies that have gained popularity for their versatility in purchasing anything from everyday items to real estate. As the use of cryptocurrency in e-commerce continues to surge, driven by the robust security provided by blockchain technology, online merchants face a unique challenge. The dilemma arises when online merchants accept crypto payments but still need to pay their employees and suppliers in traditional fiat currencies (USD/EUR). Converting crypto payments into fiat currencies adds an additional layer of complexity, time, and costs, often outweighing the perceived benefits of accepting crypto. Among the pain points experienced by online merchants, concerns about the safety of crypto and lengthy payout processes take center stage. Merchants worry about potential fund loss, as traditional banks offer a higher level of guarantee compared to crypto payment services. Despite the financial crisis being a decade behind us, reports of lost crypto funds still surface intermittently, contributing to lingering apprehension among businesses. Additionally, delays in receiving fiat funds due to convoluted payment procedures further compound the frustrations faced by merchants. However, the good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to tackle these challenges head-on through seamless fiat conversions, enhanced buyer protection, and streamlined payout processes. Some crypto payment platforms are now bridging the gap between web2 and web3. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, the potential of payment gateway solutions to facilitate broader crypto acceptance among online businesses becomes evident. Notable platforms such as Shopify, Alternative Airlines, GUESS, and Shopify have already embraced crypto payment method, with more platforms expected to follow suit. What are your thoughts on the obstacles faced by online businesses in accepting crypto? How do you perceive the potential of payment gateway solutions in overcoming these challenges?
Comment 1
Content: It's one way to increase adoption. Crypto payment solution is non-stop!


Comment 2
Content: I think an underrated aspect of payment solutions is security. Recently started looking into BrillionFi, they seem to have this on lock though in their wallet solution. Personally, I believe that with more users onboarded into the crypto space, we might need something more solid and longer lasting than our current autonomous wallets whose security is largely dependent on us.

So you can kiss those jobs and many others goodbye in the near future.This is where Learn 2 Earn(as well as several other UBI mechanisms) will come into play. There is a lot of value in a well educated society, so at a certain point it will make sense to not only stop charging for education, but to reward students for learning.Also, Blockchain will be used to collect data to quickly identify students learning styles while connecting them with teachers who specialize in that particular learning style.Now you're probably thinking ""that sounds cool, but where does the money come from?""The money comes from several places. The easiest source is the data collected. Data is one of the most valuable ""commodities"" there is currently. There is always someone looking to monetize data.The 2nd place money will come from us major corporations. Without a doubt, when robots take our jobs, corporations are going to be taxed heavy to compensate the UBI.The beauty of the '""Learn 2 Earn"" format is those corporations will likely be able to tap into the ""hive mind"" of the students they are helping to fund.I'm excited to see the developments this brings to education.

Content: Those protocols you listed all have low liquidity and low total valued locked (TVL) in modern DeFi. All I see is, like you said, huge hype...except there really isn't much usage. To answer your question, all the exciting stuff these days is happening on Ethereum (ETH). 1. Huge upcoming network upgrade to proof of stake (""The Merge"")2. Deeply liquid, secure, and complex DeFi economy3. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)4. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)5. Soulbound tokens6. And other killer apps that we haven't seen yetAverage Joes may not be able to make use of these things *yet,* but that doesn't mean they won't be able to in the future. It's not ""grandma proof"" yet, but is getting there. Besides ETH, you've also got privacy use cases that an average Joe may want. Coins like Zcash and Monero come to mind for something like that- each with its own advantages/ disadvantages. Then of course, you still have non-crypto ordinary people that have money to invest. If they want to hedge but don't want to buy something like Gold, they may directly (or indirectly) buy Bitcoin.

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/zxvudi/investments_in_web3_have_seen_a_growth_of_over_75/,Investments in Web3 have seen a growth of over 75% since 2018 to this day.,"Billions of dollars have been invested in multiple transversals technologies ranging from Clean energy, to Bioengineering, and most importantly Web3 development.In fact, Web3 has seen the most growth in investments, gaining more than $20 billion dollars since 2018Very few sectors in history have seen this amount of growth in this very short period of time and this actually makes sense.Blockchain technology has been advancing in more and more every single day and with these advancements we’re starting to see real world use cases, a lot of which major companies are taking advantage of and integrating into their systems of work.Take Polygon for example. This Web3 platform alone has already introduced dozens of major companies ranging from tech (Meta, Nothing Phone, HTC), to social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), to payment services (Stripe, PayPal), to fashion brands (Adidas, Prada, D&G), to finance (JP Morgan, Ernst & Young), to entertainment (Disney, NFL), and so on and so on.And as these L2s and Web3 accelerators keep on developing better and better tech for scalability, I’m pretty sure that an even larger number of companies and institutions will start investing in Web3.This is only the beginning. The trend hasn’t even been set yet.Finally, we also need to take into consideration that the global market is going through a major bear cycle meaning that this growth is most likely to boom even harder in the upcoming years.Investing in Web3 is seriously a no brainer at this point of time.
Comment 1
Content: Not trying to be a downer or anything but rather seeking enlightenment. Has this investment panout yet. Meaning is there a company or technology that has made an impact like:- Spotify revolutionising the way we consume music- Netflix doing the same for movies and tv shows- Facebook to keep in touch with friends- YouTube for creators and consumers- etc...Is there a success story yet with tangible everyday applications for common people in web3 world?


Comment 2
Content: Quick reminder that investment is not an indicator of return. Especially pertinent when watching crypto implode. I work in tech (the big globally scaled kind), it takes a lot to form and nourish an ecosystem. Dollars from speculators with $ to burn isn't an indicator of future success, not even close.


Comment 3
Content: Web3 has seen significant growth in recent years with the development of innovative projects such as Ocean, Ore ID, and others that facilitate the integration of traditional web2 with web3. These advancements suggest a bright future for web3 technology.


Comment 4
Content: > This is only the beginning100% agreed. Web3 is attracting a lot of attention. I've never seen a project settling so many partnerships as Polygon. I'm also holding Dia, Link, Arweave, and Helium. Dia is already integrated with 30+ L1/L2 and Link is a clear bull pick for 2023, especially if the big players decide to connect to the blockchain to use smart contracts.


Comment 5
Content: Web3 has produced four unicorns so far and between 2021 and 2022 alone, the country registered over 170 new Web3 start-ups,over 50% CAGR growth since 2015.


Comment 6
Content: I always say that blockchain projects always do well. I also see a lot of companies jumping into the gravy train. Global Emerging Markets invested 25m in Geeq (the layer zero multichain blockchain). I've also seen some other investments they've made, and I gotta say, they're on to something.


Comment 7
Content: Privacy is a key concern in the development and use of Web3 technologies, and zero-knowledge proofs (zkPs) offer a promising approach for preserving privacy on decentralized platforms. Investment in Web3 has grown significantly in recent years, and it is important that privacy considerations are taken into account as more companies and institutions adopt these technologies.


Comment 8
Content: I believe the monetization and identity management aspect of web3 is a major contributor to the adoption rate. Though there are still limitations but I believe there's still room for improvement.


Comment 9
Content: To be honest, Web3 has seen tremendous growth, and it is a niche that appears to be leading on a variety of use cases ranging from identity management to asset management to privacy, security, and everything in between. It's simply best to invest while it is still in its infancy.

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/qksel8/change_my_mind_on_web3/,Change my mind on Web3.,"I personally think that Web3 is an incredible idea and concept that could revolutionize the way we use the internet. But to me, that's where it ends - as a great idea and concept. Decentralization is something that would leave a profoundly positive impact on society, but I don't think it's something that could ever break into the mainstream. I thought earlier this year that the NFT boom was going to be something that motivates people to educate themselves on Web3 - it's been a full year since it gathered all this notoriety and people just see the space as a joke. Even the people that are heavily involved in the scene just talk about Web3 being the future on Twitter to sound smart. You would think that if they truly believed in Web3 and decentralization, they would adopt and promote new, decentralized social media like Mastodon and Aether to their peers and followers. Another point: the fact that Facebook continuously exploits and misleads its users should be enough alone for everyone using it to jump ship - but they don't. People just don't value their privacy anymore, even with mainstream resources available like the documentary ""The Social Dilemma"", they still don't care. Am I missing anything substantial? The last thing I want to do is be closed-minded about this - I just feel like it's such a stretch that Web3 is inevitable like everyone is saying. I think that it would take a full cultural reset and even the extinction of capitalism to transition from Web2 to Web3.
Comment 1
Content: Its still quite early to be expecting mainstream adoption(however you would measure that).. it is not out of the realm of possibility that it might not work either. But I'll try to point out a few things that I have to remind myself all the time, and why I think that Web3 is inevitable: 1. Some of the brightest minds are working on this. I've never seen a group of individuals from all walks of life trying to solve problems that face the future of Web3. It is the intersection of so many specializations (law, politics, economics, technology). Because of this I'm very hopeful for the outcomes that we will see in the next decade. Even if we don't have that ""fully decentralized internet running on blockchains"", whatever will come out of it, it will be interesting and I'm super exited about it.2. Before Web1 we were building protocols, and ways for nodes to communicate in order to send and receive data. With the TCP/IP protocol we enabled nodes to locate each-other and send arbitrary data to each other. This was the foundation of the internet. Only after those protocols were developed, did we have ""mainstream adoption"". TCP/IP was being developed throughout the 70s and early 80s. Mainstream Web1 only came to be in the 90s. Currently we are still trying to figure out protocol level solutions that will make our vision of Web3 work. Polkadot and Eth2 are those Layer 0 protocols that will connect isolated blockchain networks, and enable them to speak to one another. There is a fractal effect happening here, at first we were simply connecting nodes to build networks.. now we are trying to now figure out how to make networks speak to other networks. This is a difficult problem to solve, and will take time. We will fail many times and we will learn from those mistakes, and keep building.3. Your last point is interesting, and I believe there are multiple possibilities of how a ""cultural reset"" might impact the development of Web3. In one potential you might be right, we might need a massive crisis to finally see the value of these Web3 technologies and only then will they make sense, hence leading to a ""general adoption"". But also a much worse ""cultural reset"" in the form of a world war might erase centuries of development. I'd like to quote Albert Einstein here to paint the picture ""I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.""4. We need a better system in order to scale our civilization to where we are going. The old systems to verify, validate and secure data is no longer sufficient enough for where we are headed. Blockchains solve this. Centralized systems have failed us far too many times, and the stakes are getting higher and higher, we need better.So to say the least, your skepticism is well received, I think it's quite reasonable.. but in my view, looking at the history of how we have been decentralizing and centralizing in different forms as a species, in all aspects of our lives, I believe Web3 to be a inevitable.. it just might not end up what we might think it is right now.Hope this helps.


Comment 2
Content: A new form of social media catching on, let alone a Web3 one, is incredibly hard because of the network effect that Facebook has today. That is, that's where most everyone 'hangs out' and if you were to join a new network like Mastodon it would be quite lonely until tons more people show up. So it's a bit of a Catch22 until little by little, a tipping point is reached. For it to take off it may have to follow Facebook's trajectory: young people joining while it's still cool, and as more and more of them do and word gets out, then their parents and other older people will follow in droves.That's actually not entirely unlikely to happen. Facebook already has a massive problem in that teenagers think it's lame (in big part because their parents have joined in droves and have overrun it with boomer nonsense, and also because of Facebook shooting itself in the foot with the cringey decisions they've made in recent years) and recently it became apparent that the 21-30 year old demographic is doing a mass exodus as well. They're going to TikTok and Instagram and the like primarily because those are cooler platforms and their parents aren't on them .. but TikTok and Instagram offer a different type of social media experience than Facebook so there is a void to potentially fill, and younger people are much more likely to try a Web3 alternative for similar reasons as why they've taken to crypto: they generally understand technology better and are more open to trying new things.To sell them on the Web3 alternative though, you need to think beyond the word 'decentralized' because that doesn't mean anything to normies. To sell younger people (and eventually older ones too) on a Web3 social media experience, I think you'd have to highlight:\- a censorship-resistant platform where there isn't a central authority who decides what can and can't be discussed\- transparency around the algorithms that decide what people are shown, and shared governance for how those algorithms evolve\- a shared revenue model of some sort, where instead of users on Facebook being the product and our data being packaged and sold to advertisers, users are actually paid for spending time on the platform from the advertisement dollars flowing in. Imagine a world where you actually earn tokens that have real value for spending time on social media .. you basically flip the model where instead of Facebook executives and their shareholders earning the majority of the profits from the advertisements being run on their platform, to a model where team who created and manages this new Web3 social media app getting fairly compensated for their work and the rest of the profits being shared with users in the form of those token rewards. Oh and users are also able to control and own their data and decide whether they want to opt-in to the advertisement model. I believe BAT (Basic Attention Token) is already doing something like this with their web browser. I'm not an expert on the economic model by any means and am just riffing here so it would need much more refinement, but it could possibly look something like this.On the subject of NFTs - I think they are getting ridiculed in pop culture mostly for valid reasons .. it is, at least on a surface level, a bit ridiculous to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for some art that some would say isn't very good. There's a lot of flipping for profit and it can look like a ponzi scheme from the outside looking in. That said, art is of course very subjective and if someone really likes the look of something and wants to definitely say that they own a one of a kind piece of digital property, it is cool that they are able to pay for the right to do so. However, the bigger problem is that the media and normies are completely overlooking that this is just the first NFT use case that's caught on but there will be many more with much greater real-world utility. Imagine if early adopters of email bought computers solely for the purpose of sending cat memes to each other, and everyone else dismissed email and the internet as a fad. When NFTs evolve to settling property deeds, vehicle registrations and other legal contracts, is when it'll all start making more sense.


Comment 3
Content: Yeah your missing that devs are currently learning more and more about web3 stacks and slowly building a culture. This wont happen over night. Give it a few years when the fees are lowest and when 'hiring a blockchain dev' will be part of your local studio's business propositions. There will be demand for blockchain tech to sit alongside already existing products. Facebook is dying a slow death but it also plays a major role in connecting people with businesses, thats hard to kill. But in terms of socialising? who cares. Look at the smaller cases first, i.e, any case that is about to cut out the the middle man. It's still too early to tell but it seems to me at least people are slowly learning the point of decentralisation. Additionally, I wouldn't be too bothered with the defi and nft things, invest in the realisation that the tech will be realised itself, its just got a few more upgrades to go.


Comment 4
Content: Web3 is hard to sell to end user for adoption. Devs need to migrate web2 to web3, full adoption is unlikely or will take multiple generations. I see it as a tool we can choose to use. Will it get popular? Probably. Mainstream? Not likely, will be used by minorities, groups, etc. Web2 and politicians may fight it, ""Tool that helps criminals, bla, bla.."" People like Alex Jones would use it course they got ""de-platformed"" on web2. Spun his site on web3 - on unstopable domains, decentralized storage, censorship resistant.Also, darkweb is around for a while. Seems like web3 is the next version of that? easier to use, not yet polluted by criminals?


Comment 5
Content: I think it’s like 5+ years. Facebook’s announcement, though cringe, what I took away is they are going to explain it to the world and build the mental models. They’re gonna build the mall, but it’ll be a smooth on-ramp for society. Metamask ain’t it.


Comment 6
Content: Main problem I see right now is still usability. Yes there were major advances in the space and it is quite simple to use already. But as long as the play store / apple store won't publish web3 apps it won't go main stream.The hit main stream you need to get the young generations, and most of them won't go to some website to download a social media app just because it ""protects your data""Next thing is the network effect, you need way more than a twitter copy to get going. Again, most people know that web2 social media stores all their data, sells it, or does whatever with it. Most people just don't care. Heck even I don't care if it means I have a better experiece. Let netflix create a profile of myself if that means I will get recommended a show I will like without searchig for an hour I'm game.To get web3 mainstream we don't need more secure versions of web2 applications, we need new exciting products, and we need to get the mobile app stores to open up for web3. Sadly, I don't think the later part will happen soon. Apple and Google seem to be completely against it, and I don't blame them for it. Even the game scene has a problem due to steam banning all crypto games, although the PC gaming scene is more open to download games from other places. Solution to the problem: Make an app that hits off like TikTok, get the young generation onto web3 and make it so big that the big mobile markets can't ignore it

Comment 10
Content: not enough content/ppl to drive adoption. if you're asking ppl to ditch existing traffic/network, you'll need to provide some kind of value prop over existing ones. i may be wrong but just like tiktok/clubhse did not duplicate FB, i think the new web3 social media wont be a decentralized FB but sth more.

It would be to Audible what Nostr is to Twitter. Audiobooks would be sold as NFTs and relayed via servers running the bubble protocol. * Authors retain full ownership and control of their content without being tied to a specific company. They get to keep a much higher percentage of the sale price and can crowdfund their book launches.* Listeners own their audiobooks as NFTs and can use any app they like to listen to them. They can sell their books on an NFT marketplace (if the author permits it) and invest in authors' crowdfunds to share in their success.* Developers can build end-user dapps and profit from the audiobooks bought through them.* Relay server owners can profit by hosting content with payments handled automatically by the bubble protocol.Would anyone be interested in using such a platform? Anyone want to help me build it?
Comment 1
Content: AI which turns books into audio-visual presentations with dynamically-generated AI art may be the next step for this old industry. Consider that.


Comment 2
Content: Interesting idea, however it would take tremendous funding. I would imagine you would need to fund audio production somehow. Most authors get their audio versions produced by their publisher. Independent authors would need to find a way to replicate that easily. However as the model moves forward, possibly publishing houses would want to release their works on the network.Curious to see how this could progress.

Basically I'm super interested in the concept of web 3, but I currently have the knowledge to build anything in it. I'm happy to go out and learn, but I'm struggling to see what things I can build today of any value. I realize things like defi are massive, nfts seem like an interesting idea but I'm not convinced of their current form, the list of it.Is there anywhere that lists all the cool projects going on or things to get involved in? I think I'm basically looking for inspiration.
Comment 1
Content: I was on the same boat ( still kind of am on the same boat) this is what I’m working on and it has helped make things a bit clearer. First I took a class to truly explore decentralization, blockchain technology etc. I took MITs 15.s12 blockchain and money. It focuses on defi, but it is a great place to get your feet wet. More than anything do the coursework , specifically with the information from class, build a project that specifically uses blockchain/ Web3. The trick here is to focus on the technology. I agree with ov3rwatch that people are just trying to port web2 ideas to Web3. You have to focus on why does this solution NEED web 3. What does decentralization bring to the table that centralized networks can’t do. Do t worry about it being profitable yet. Just focus on the tech and that will get your creativity flowing .P.s lecture 12 of that MIT Course is about identifying use cases. I definitely recommend that lecture if you are looking for something faster than the entire class.

Content: The greatest solutions on web3 will be solving unknown problems. Most people are coming to web3 trying to port over web2 ideas.

Comment 4
Content: Definitely! Web3 is the pillar of decentralization, referring to decentralized file managing system. The best custodial system to protect users data, added to Gamefi which is giving back to the gamers' Community while facilitating commonwealth via NFT characters trading and other Art of work. I can related AOZ , the Age Of Zalmoxis, the most complete Multiplayer RPG Games on Elrond network , leaded by Prof. Dr Alexandru Berzovan doctor in ancient history. Players take the role of a proud Dacian champion, whose body merges with a heroic soul. They will fight otherworldly monsters and mortal foes who seek to further fragment the Dacian Kingdom. Well, there's nothing more interesting than learning while having fun and get paid! Do your own research, btw☺️


Comment 5
Content: Yeah, but it's still a young niche imo, requiring a lot of improvements.Adoption should start to increase more as mainstream game studios leverage on blockchain tech to build blockchain-based games, and we are starting to see Cartesi leveling that up with the [partnership](https://medium.com/cartesi/how-dsphere-is-launching-the-next-generation-of-blockchain-games-with-the-blockchain-os-5812ec68b9cf) with dSphere, which is an indication of growth in the industry.

Comment 7
Content: We can’t ignore the impact gaming projects are making with respect to web3 adoption. I guess that’s why Cartesi is supporting more games being built on their infrastructure and supporting other gaming projects like Dsphere, Aetheras etc. I believe we’ll see more of this trend on blockchain in the coming years.

Comment 1
Content: Any NFT project that is launched by an influencer = bad as they’re clearly a money grab and 99% are abandoned after a pump and dump.Good ones = I’m just starting to research for good use cases but ideas are everywhere: - NFT car service history and certificate- Voting ballots- DAOs used for public company organization- Global remittance using crypto- NFT game assets that are interoperable between games- NFT certificate proof of authenticity So many more. Just getting drowned by success hodl stories or dump scams.


Comment 2

Comment 3
Content: I believe that DATA is the core of web3, so those who deal with it will be the winners! LINK, DIA, OCEAN, FIL, etc are among my top picks in the space!

Web3 projects that are good and true Web3: what is emerging from Web2 that addresses the desires and pain points established in the Web2 ecosphere. Crypto, block chain, nfts, and metaverses now are definitely NOT Web3 although all the niche creators in bubbles pretend they are in a small circular jerking ecosphere.

Content: >Let me focus of stablecoinsAlgo stablecoins are bad, none has been proven to work particularly well in truly representing the currency they are supposed to represent.On the other hand, over-collateralized stablecoins are better off as we have seen. Or even being fully backed by off-chain assets (fiats and bonds), regulated by the respective countries which own the underlying currency, like in the case of e-Money stables.

Content: Yeah we have tons of very bad web3 projects, especially those that are not solving real-life problems and are having too many influencers talk about it on TwitterI would rather go with the one that has good fundamentals and maybe well-known partners I feel very confident about Railgun because they have been consistently building in this dip and recently they launched their Relayer feature that pays users a gas fee thus keeping your wallet address anonymous from the recipient.

I know this is a general question, but I’m keen to hear what you guys think. The sooner we can identify the foundational roadblocks, the sooner we can start building solutions!
Comment 1
Content: Product-market fit.In most use cases I've come across web3 is not a quantum leap in solving mass market jobs-to-be-done. Web3 is primarily focused on anti-establishment value propositions, something that is not a concern of the mass market despite the opinion of many web3 zealots.Another thing I notice are projects like ""X on the blockchain"" when the blockchain doesn't provide any new efficiencies over centralized solutions.Whether the user is trusting a piece of software that someone else says is decentralized and safe, or a company that has a good brand saying their centralized software is safe, mass-market doesn't differentiate.I look at web3 as either a niche cybersecurity play or a digital collab platform for the anti-establishment (which won't last long as the establishment regulates/prosecutes). By definition, mass = establishment.


Comment 2
Content: 1. Wallets suck. Seed phrases are confusing and a huge source of friction. Facebook/Apple/Google login to wallet is a pattern that a lot more people would be comfortable with. 2. A very simple product that makes owning a wallet desirable. Back in the mid nineties, e-mail was the original killer app. Only when enough people had email addresses was Amazon possible.


Comment 3
Content: Purpose.


Comment 4
Content: Safety is the biggest obstacle so far. It's just too risky that you'd rather stay a way. You can lose your money due to factors entirely not your fault. It's scary at times.Another thing is that most of the solution shouldn't be targeted at individual and retail users. Enterprise solutions will in turn bring in retail imo.What the likes of AR, OCEAN, ALGO are doing is more important than we recognise, i.e if they continue to succeed.


Comment 5
Content: Centralized authorities


Comment 6
Content: Lack of security and fragmented liquidity are some of the biggest obstacles. I think there is a need for proper regulation and a better, more efficient liquidity aggregator in the crypto space if we want to see a solution to these issues. Also, OCEAN and CTSI are two top projects I believe will aid in mass adoption as OCEAN is building a new data economy + data monetization, and CTSI is bringing a proper operating system for blockchain and Web3.User-friendly products.


Comment 7
Content: Lack of compelling Apps available. More work needs to be done in that area. Although there are several thousand Web3 apps available, most in the DeFi genre, there are still not that many compelling dApps available for consumers. Only a few projects like OCEAN allow us to control and monetize our own content and data – enabling the creation of new income streams. I feel we need more innovative features like this to bring mass adoption to web3.

Time, liability, and cost are some of the obstacles that Web2 developers face while building their product, while Web3 offers an affordable, permissionless, and secure infrastructure for devs to design their dapps. So far, DAOs are considered by many as the business model of Web3, since they’re not influenced or controlled by a central government or entity, instead governance is done by holders of the DAO token through voting, meaning when the DAO makes money, DAO members also make money. BitDAO is basically the Web3’s treasury, since the community owns the world’s largest decentralized treasury, and are using it to support the builders of the Web3 economy. Web3 is still in its early stages, meaning there are many opportunities in the gaming, technology, financial, and other markets for developers and entrepreneurs.

They are building the BlockchainOS, leveraging the power of all popular coding languages and onboarding all mainstream software developers to the blockchain.

Comment 8
Content: The rise of DAO are helping the new generation of people to securely work in Web3 and not go to offices. To achieve this, XDAO is constantly holding master classes on DAO and helping to find jobs, familiarizing you with resources in the Web3 space.


Comment 9
Content: What is crypto if not breaking barriers really. Regardless of the UST and LUNAR saga, the crypto ecosystems is still undeterred and committed to the decentralisation dream. Some projects have taken the rebranding route and its commendable also. For example, tokens like $DINO rebranding to $GREEN. No doubt, the rebranding and the regular burning will solve the hyperinflation issue and get the project ready for the bull season once the market recovers.

Tennessee has become the second state to enact laws recognizing and allowing LLC registration of decentralized autonomous organizations, also known as DAOs (pronounced ""dows""). Wyoming was the first state to pass laws along these lines. DAOs are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that are led by computer code rather than human leaders. Consider a DAO to be a corporation, except instead of shareholders voting, it uses blockchain to make choices on behalf of its users based on a set of rules. They're made to allow strangers to collaborate safely, transparently, and effectively over the internet.The bill's proponent, State House Rep. Jason Powell (D-Nashville), claims the freshly passed legislation will make Tennessee ""the Delaware of DAOs”, There are several Daos out there like the Crystal Dao and the Heritage Dao and this is an encouraging movement. It now needs just Gov. Bill Lee's signature to become law. He claims that ""with this new corporate structure, Tennessee will be a beacon for blockchain investment, new jobs, and investment."" ""In the same way that Delaware has become a hotspot for traditional LLCs and South Dakota has become a hub for credit card businesses,"" says the author. The bipartisan bill, which passed overwhelmingly in the House and Senate, has been praised by members of the business and IT industries. The measure is ""groundbreaking,"" according to Ron Shultis, director of policy and research for Tennessee's Beacon Center.""This bill creates a forward-thinking regulatory environment, signaling to investors and entrepreneurs that Tennessee is the place to be and invest,"" Shultis said. Mike Audi is the creator of TIKI, a digital firm based in Nashville's downtown area. He believes that this legislation will add gasoline to the fire of Tennessee's burgeoning IT sector. According to Audi, ""Nashville is gradually becoming a hub for Web3 firms."" ""Expect to see more of it if favorable legislation is passed. ""Founders will flock here to develop, build, and stay."" Many, if not all, businesses who have established DAOs in Wyoming aren't actually based or operating in Wyoming, according to Audi. For many people, Wyoming is just a place to register. However, tech businesses are flocking to Nashville for what they see as a business-friendly atmosphere and burgeoning tech ecosystem, including his own, which relocated to Nashville last year.Many, if not all, businesses who have established DAOs in Wyoming aren't actually based or operating in Wyoming, according to Audi.

Notable DAOs in the sector include MakerDAO, BitDAO, Compound DAO, Uniswap etc. Formidable lesser known projects like Subsquid amongst others have even commenced the process of transforming into a DAO. With this favorable legislation in Tennessee, I forsee some of these blockchain projects setting up shop in Tennessee.

I want to make this question clear with an example:**Web2:** Alice and Bob want to text each other on a social media page, they decide on Facebook and start to text each other. The App on which the two text is Facebook, the underlying infrastructure are the Facebook servers. We all know how Facebook makes its money, so the Elements of revenue are the users’ data and the payments from the ad providers. In the end, the ad providers are the ones who pay directly for the servers and the users are paying indirectly with their data. This is a simplified version of how the servers get financed (Advertisement business model)**Web3:** Alice and Bob want to text each other on a social media page, they decide on *DAppXYZ* and start to text each other. The App on which the two text is *DAppXYZ*, the underlying infrastructure is the Ethereum blockchain. But what are the elements of revenue? We know the Ethereum blockchain gets maintained through the miners who are getting rewarded by tx fees and protocol rewards and these come from the users who make transactions. How would this model work with a social media DApp? Someone must pay the miners (stakers in the future). Is there going to be a tx fee for every message or every week in form of a smart contract? In Web2 we have the infamous advertisement business model, what business model does Web3 have?I fully sympathize with the core ideas of Web3, and I'm interested but this is a fundamental concept that is not clear for me. Would love it if somebody could point out my errors or help me in some way!Cheers.

Content: I’m not a Web3 expert by any means, so take this with a grain of salt.I think your correct in pointing out this gap/inconsistency in the Web3 business model. My understating is that in Web3, users pay for infrastructure (e.g gas fees) and maintain agency over other elements of revenue such as their own user data, and if they want to offset their gas fees by selling user data they can do that. So maybe when setting up DAppXYZ you tick a box agreeing to let them use your data in exchange for not passing along your gas fees. Seems really similar to agreeing to terms & conditions when you sign up for Facebook.I think most proponents of Web3 take for granted that users value control and privacy over convenience, but I think that’s not the case especially in places like the United States. These kinds of gaps between market needs/demands and the features/solutions offered by Web3 are a risk to scaling to the level of dominance that web2 has achieved.


Comment 2
Content: Here are a couple of ideas:1. If you deploy an ad business model in web3, it would look more profits shared to the users, with user owned data. So Alice and Bob may both share in 80% ad revenue, while 20% is paid to Ethereum blockchain. Today Facebook is 100% take rate, you get nothing and own nothing of your data. 2. Twist to the above. Maybe Alice doesn’t want to see ads. So she forgoes the Ad revenue she would get and indeed uses a small fraction of her Ethereum staking interest, to pay for messaging on the blockchain. 3. New business model example. “Digital banks” that store your crypto, or lending, could provide social media services for free as an perk for you to check in your crypto with them. 4. Maybe it’s a social media run on donations that you may get perks. Think like Wikipedia + OmazeCould be other business models.. I think that’s what makes this interesting, freedom of choice and potential options. Once you remove the need for a corporation to take 100% of it all for its 1% shareholders, it’s a different game. Like a new community capitalism.


Comment 3
Content: I'm honestly doubtful that messaging will be a big thing for web3. We already have a lot of free messaging apps, email, etc. Web3 will allow people to build provably end to end encrypted messaging, but I'd expect it to be free or close to free. Web3 doesn't mean rebuilding everything on the blockchain. A lot of stuff works perfectly in web2, and just doesn't need to change. Some things didn't exist in Web2 or were bad. Thats why NFTs and Defi are a big thing now. Another thing that I expect to happen is that companies like Auth0 will go out of business. Web3 offers a consistent easy way to handle logins which just makes that business pointless.


Comment 4
Content: It is simple. You pay for it with money. Web3 is the web of true ownership and altruism. If you want to send a message you pay for it. Or you pay for the next hundred messages without care because you had a good day. So the next question is why should people adopt that? Well maybe because it is the right thing to do and people are way less shitty when good behaviour is accounted for.


Comment 5
Content: Interesting question. Not being an expert as well, I can think of a couple of options.First is to allow data collection by appXYZ, for instance information about how much use the app, what you use it for, your behavior on the app (emote usage, time of usage) etc. Companies pay for this info (decentralized and the info is anonymized of course) and fuel your use of the app.Second option is ads being displayed. I'm imagining a possibility where you can select to display ads, advertisers pay for these which in turn pays for you using the service.Third is a system in which you pay for the service itself. Perhaps less so in a way in which you have to actively transfer funds, but maybe an incentive in which your wallet is tied to the app and it periodically subtracts small funds for usage. There can be other benefits to this system as well: perhaps the app allows for possibilities to earn said token for certain ways of behavior.Alternatively there's also the whatsapp model: some businesses pay to make use of the service in some way, e.g. they get special privileges for special functions. Automatic reply function, stuff like that. Businesses pay for these, in return their investments allow the network to function (to a degree).Lastly, perhaps there's a way to passively allow your device to power the app by performing low-stake calculations? In this way you pay for your own usage, it requires battery-use but in return the calculations your device performs are to some benefit to the network and subsequently allows the app to run.But I'm sure there are numerous models. Same with DeFi: it requires some creativity to figure out how to get it going, but there's different ways to incentivize, just got to find something that works.

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/rfvkv1/its_the_future_of_governance_dao/,It's The Future of Governance (DAO),"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice. **TLDR**:The centralised way of decision making and governance is inefficient. DAO is a new way of organisation and making decisions, instead of relying on the central authority. Everyone gets to be part of the decision making process. #equality# General ConclusionAs the world moves towards digitisation, many things are changing. One of the themes we talk about in this series is economics. Economics is really about **organising and coordinating resources** in our economy.And that brings us to today's topic of DAO. It is a **new way of organisation** in our increasingly changing economy.# 1. Solution to Decentralised GovernanceHowever, there are many **short-falls to centralised governance**. Inefficient execution, incentive misalignment, smaller voices for the minority.So what is the solution? **Decentralised** and **autonomy** in decision making, with **automation** in execution by machines, when possible.That is DAO — decentralised autonomous organisations.>Note: Whilst we mainly talk about blockchain, DAO can exist on both blockchain and non-blockchain technological stack. It can also work in any digital ecosystem, platform or ledger.A DAO is mainly a new way of governance and decision making. It could also combine with automated execution via smart contracts.# 2. Importance of DAODAO is an organisation for decision making. Everyone that is part owner of this organisation also gets to vote on decisions. Decisions can vary — how to allocate funds, which projects to support, what to do with funds.DAOs are1. Not centralised, so no one person can interfere with decision making *(Looking at you,* *Adam Neumann* *from WeWork)*2. Transparent and auditable3. Cannot be shut down by any one*My utopia*: I imagine a world where we exist digitally. Where it transcends geographical jurisdictions and create governance rules on its own. You can decide which governance rule you prefer and exist in that digital ecosystem. We are not bounded by race, nationality, skin colour or language. But by philosophy and ideology. Then the market will decide which autonomous organisation will succeed.# 3. Economics of DAOEconomics is more than just supply in demand. In DAOs, we will discuss these 3 economics:* **Economics of trust**: we want to be able to trust the parties we are interacting with. This is done through smart contracts and skin in the game. *Example:* *PieDAO** **Economics of coordination**: decision making with a small group of shareholders is tough. Decision making with a decentralised group is even harder. DAO helps with this coordination. *Example:* *MolochDAO,* *MakerDAO** **Economics of allocation**: like how government collect tax revenue and decide where to allocate it, the DAO also gets to decide on the governance structure of the ecosystem. *Example:* *KyberDAO,* *Dash,* *LAO* *(by OpenLaw)*Ultimately, DAO is a **new way of governance as our economies continue to evolve**. It could use tokens or do without. It is still part of the economics design since it is a way of decentralised governance. If you go deeper into details of the various DAO mechanisms, you will realise that the **mechanisms are not the same**.Let me know if you want me to do a deep dive into a DAO or other episodes that you are interested in.

https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/qyjwjc/blockchain_is_web3_but_web3_is_not_blockchain/,Blockchain is web3 but web3 is not blockchain,"I read and hear about blockchain exclusively whenever web3 is discussed. I think it's important to make the distinction that web3 is decentralization and blockchain is a decentralization protocol and one that has a good answer to the Byzantine General's problem of consensus.This is great for applications in finance, law, property, poltics and other use cases that require strong consensus. However, strong eventual consistency for collaboration across the decentralized web is more than good enough for every other use case. You can re-platform most popular applications like Reddit, Twitter, Google and more on web3 with traditional cryptography protocols the don't need blockchains, tokens, and fees.Imagine a world where a tweet costs a Twitter token and gas fees all so we can agree on the content and authenticity of the Tweet forever.Instead, why not sign the tweet (and encrypt it for your followers if private account) and verify the tweet yourself on a completely decentralized and opaque p2p web.I hope we can start talking about web3 this way because a ""blockchain all the things"" future seems limited and too high friction to displace the major web 2.0 incumbents.

Content: \-Which games do you play? Currently Splinterlands and Elfin Kingdom (Beta) \-What got you excited about them? One is a TCG the other an RPG, but both bring me back to my childhood when I played Pokemon cards and the red version of Pokemon on Gameboy \-Do you buy NFTs just to play games? I got a few ""useless"" NFTs, for the cool visuals \-What kind of rewards do you want from the game? Ideally a mix of liquid tokens I can swap for other tokens/stablecoins to take profits and ingame tokens/assets that allow me to improve myself in the game. \-Mobile, Web. Does it matter? Ideally both. \-Would a free NFT convince you of joining a gaming projects community? It really depends... I believe that the requirement to buy NFTs to start playing isn't ideal. Either a free to play or at least a demo would be more inviting than ""free stuff""


Comment 4
Content: You got a lot of questions, bro :)**-Which games do you play?**I have been delving into various games. Currently, my list includes Elfin Kingdom, Axie, Illuvium, and Mobox. **-What got you excited about them?** I'll mention just a few examples. I like the fact that AXS can also be staked and allow users to earn a part of the game's revenue. This is something pretty nice and makes you feel part of something. As for Elfin, I'm excited for their Elfin Arcade. I believe that the idea of getting together gamers and developers is the right way to go. MOBOX is also a nice project. I like the opportunity to breed unique in-game characters on this one. **-Do you buy NFTs just to play games?**Both. NFTs can be very profitable over time. Participating in the marketplace can potentially generate profit. **-What kind of rewards do you want from the game?**A mix of in-game assets, tokens, and unique NFTs is exactly what I look for. **-Mobile, Web. Does it matter?**Not really. At least not for me. **-Would a free NFT convince you of joining a gaming projects community?**Well, I could try. A free NFT can't harm anyone.

Comment 7
Content: Yes. I am interested in web3 gaming projects, I played some actively before. I became interested in BSC-backed projects recently, which do not require high initial investments. Star Sharks, Elfin Kingdom, and League of Kingdom are some of my favorites. I like the incentive the Elfin Kingdom provides to the community with NFTs through the Happy Hour campaign. That's what can attract enthusiasts IMO. The most attractive part of web3 games is the various mechanisms to earn passively.
