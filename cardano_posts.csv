Comment 7
Content: Everything red Cardano is green!!!!


Comment 8
Content: For everyone asking why it’s pumping right now, here’s your answer


Comment 9
Content: Cardano is the reason I started to look at crypto because of their user-ability and is one of my biggest holding (ADA) (not saying I have that much) but every time I get paid I try to buy some. But that is just my minuscule opinion


Comment 10
Content: Cardano commercialization of the platform is already underway. Cardano is getting nation states and bringing millions of users in through that push model. Cardano also decentralized finance, and non-fungible token marketplaces. The launch of CardStarter, GeroWallet, CAR, SoMee, ERGO, LiQwid to just name a few will be game chargers and reflect ADA’s dominance in the blockchain arena.

Comment 6
Content: Out of curiosity - how does the pricing work? Do products have a fixed dollar price and a fixed Cardano price, or is the Cardano price tied to a dollar equivalent - so does it fluctuate in tandem with the changing cardano price?

Content: How do you guys handle the extreme fluctuations of the ADA value?

Comment 3
Content: From the blogpost> *Unlike ERC-20 tokens that are based on Ethereum smart contracts, the tracking and accounting of custom tokens on Cardano is supported by the ledger natively. Because native tokens do not require smart contracts to transfer their value, users will be able to send, receive, and burn their tokens without paying the transaction fees required for a smart contract or adding event-handling logic to track transactions.*

This is such great news!Edited to add: no one I know even cares about this and I’m so glad I have this community to share in the excitement about this project. Thank you!!!

Comment 2
Content: How will Cardano keep up with Ethereum's 2.0 upgrade (when, if, that arrives)?


Comment 3

Content: FYI, Cardano has never done ever 250 transactions in one second. Ever. I could make a image likes this showing eth with sharding (it’s never done it either) and show 10,000 TPS compared to Cardano and btc and it would be just as accurate as this. I’m all for being bullish but present the facts as they are or else this is just another example of unrealistic unfounded expectations not based in the real world and will only further the hype based narrative of Cardano and not the substance based narrative

Comment 2
Content: Showing average tps with energy would be a better metric.Gold also shouldnt even be there imho - just because people came up with the brilliant idea to now call btc gold because bitcoin became unusable at scale doesnt mean we should reinforce that fallacy by comparing it to gold energy usage. It is an entirely different industry solving different problems (used in electronics and such)Banking handles orders of magnitude more tps than bitcoin (4 to 7) its energy is significantly more sustainable due to this.ADA also has a path (hydra) to infinite scaling so there is a clear goal in mind to ensure its usability into mass adoption so the 6 Gwh will become more effecient as the chain upgrades.

Comment 6
Content: This doesn't prove show anything, other than BTC is pretty terrible since it's catching almost half of banking energy consumption but doesn't even make for even close to 1% of global transactions. Per transaction energy usage is the metric that is going to prove/show anything relevant.


Comment 7
Content: How is it possible that Gold consumes that much energy? Are the banks bored and just heating them up to cast them into some other shape than a gold bar?


Comment 8
Content: I strongly believe this is the way of the future.. I can see right now how people are sleeping on ADA with only a small percentage of the population dabbling in Cryptocurrency (and trying to make a quick buck off hype/meme coins). However, when reality starts to set in and people get the grasp of what crypto can actually do for the planet I’m banking Cardano to be one of the pioneers if not the pioneer of the future of currency. Once everyone gets over the hype of meme coins and those that don’t carry the fundamentals of what makes cryptocurrency great humanity will be on a much better path towards a brighter future. I think those that are using it as a means to “get rich” have the wrong mindset. It is an investment towards a different way of life. Let’s goooo!!!!

Firstly let's clarify that pool fees are not a direct cost to you, the delegator! Fees are simply the pools share of rewards when they are distributed.**Fixed fee**This is a set amount of ADA the pool earns (min. 340 ADA). *e.g If the fixed fee = 340 ADA: If a a pool earns 20000 ADA, the pool gets 340 ADA, and it's delegators get 19,600 ADA.***Variable fee (aka pool margin)**The variable fee is a percentage of rewards the pool earns. *e.g. If the variable fee = 1%: If a pool earns 20000 ADA, the pool gets 200 ADA, and it's delegators get 19,800 ADA.**Note treasury tax not included in examples for simplicity.***When making a delegation try to:*** Support pools that contribute to the community.* Use wallets that allow you to select your own pool (like [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/)).* Avoid staking with [large entities](https://adapools.org/groups) like Binance (It's bad for decentralisation and therefore the project).**Make sure you visit** [](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoStakePools/)**!**# RewardsComment command: `?rewards`There are 3 incentive mechanisms that allow the community to earn rewards in ADA:**Staking Rewards**Staking is incentivised as it's important for network function as intended.

That means:* Rewards are compounded - rewards are added to your main balance and thus are captured in the next epoch snapshot which goes through the delegation cycle for increased rewards.* Any additional ADA you add to the wallet increases your rewards (again once the balance has been captured in a snapshot and has gone through the delegation cycle).**Community Advisor Rewards**In [Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) you can earn rewards be writing thoughful reviews on proposal projects as a community advisor.Sign up to the [ideascale platform](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) and make sure to read the [community advistor guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QkdaFK1tigrSI40iMeV3UP9GyTGsoqVmCUp7OJz0WFs/edit).**Voting Rewards**Voting is another important part of being a community member, as and ADA holder you hold voting power.

Comment 5
Content: Hey fellow Ada holders.Long time holder (bought on launch in 2017), staking since inception, and long term bull of the Cardano ecosystem.I need some love my fellow man. I have followed Cardano Reddit for years, but never comment since I'm not active enough on reddit and just never built my karma. However, I'd love to contribute to the community and spread some of my knowledge from years in the space with an economics and finance background.As the space evolves, I'm really curious following and helping develop multi consensus protocols where chains aren't dependent on single consensuses such as PoW or PoS solely. Charles has some great papers in the works on this which is more exciting to me in ways than smart contracts! Anyways, need that 10 karma to comment. Help a brother out!

Comment 2
Content: I can’t be influenced by anyone marketing doge. Not hating ,but come one ..


Comment 3
Content: I am on a cardano researching spree and the last time I was on something like that was 4 years ago when I was researching BTC. I do think it has a huge potential and now I am moving my ethers into ADA and today I delegated my first stake into staking pool. I hope Cardano environment will set a new standard within the crypto universe. ADA price doesn’t even matter right now.


Comment 4
Content: Mark sold a product that didn't work to Yahoo. He's clever, but I don't listen to him when he speaks.


Comment 5
Content: After reading the exchange on twitter, I'm not completely convinced that a lot of market enthusiasts really want to see crypto/defi/blockchain succeed. This falls in line with Warren Buffets teams comments and how the current financial system is set up. This reminds me a lot of Apple in the 1980s, or Amazon in the late-90's. The majority of big money investors couldn't see the potential the technology/ideas presented and how it would revolutionize the world as we know. Now, i'm sure Cuban (and Musk) are making comments that will make them money, but sooner or later they will have to jump on the train. DOGE is not the future (nothing against folks using it to make money), BTC is not the future (it will certainly be a store of value), Ethereum could be the future, but they have massive scalability issues and it remains to be seen how their ETH2 rollout will go.If you have done the research, I don't know how you couldn't come away thinking that Cardano is the next evolutionary step for blockchain/crypto. Regardless, I think there is plenty of space in the world for multiple crypto currencies and blockchains.On top of that, I don't think we have seen real marketcaps for crypto's yet. When we think of market cap, we are thinking small. I believe in the next 10 years Blockchain will be something the ENTIRE world uses on a daily basis. The current market cap for all crypto's is a little over $2T and that is without truly widescale implementation. Think about what that number will be when Web 3.0 happens.Then again, I'm no millionaire so what do I know.


Comment 6
Content: Elon and Mark know exactly what they are doing. They may have an army of advisors and PR people behind them. Please do not get fooled. I think they may have short term benefit both economically and to build a huge celebrity clout which helps their businesses beyond normal economic valuations.


Comment 7
Content: This is not FUD, but an honest question, having spent a fair bit of time in Africa over the years. How is ADA going to work hand in hand with the governments who are rife with corruption to eliminate corruption and return power to the people? What gain do the corrupt politicians in Africa get from loosening their grip on the populace? I want to see this great transformation, but I fail to see why the “powers that be” shall not only willingly cede their power, but actually play a major role in giving it up.Thoughts?


Comment 8
Content: If people don’t want to wake up to this it’ll have to be our little secret


Comment 9
Content: Crypto will change emerging and third world countries and teach the greedy irrationnal people how the new world works. ADA decebtralized world government.


Comment 10
Content: I’d argue mark DOES understand economics, and very well at that. But, as an investor he has been confirmed to be a deep ethereum holder and wants to protect his investment.

Comment 2
Content: This isn't even close to true. Cardano's own website outlines the genesis distribution and its nowhere near 98% retail. Emurgo and IOHK own >10% alone. It's blatantly misinformed posts like these that make me want to sell.

Comment 4
Content: Question time.... Keep in mind I own a shit ton of ADA and it's all staked on Daedalus and ADA is my biggest holding.I was told the other day that ETH has 170K validators. I know that ADA has around 2.5K pools. Wouldn't that mean that ETH is more decentralized than ADA?


Comment 5
Content: The main issue is that the majority of the stake is delegated to a few operators who have multiple pools which obviously is a form of centralisation. ADA holders need to support smaller single pools more to start increasing decentralisation and thus the security of the network


Comment 6
Content: Most ADA is held in cold staking and not in circulation from what I understand. Most people in for the long term including myself. Price dont mean shit to me because ADA is going to take over. Keep staking and accumulating!!

Comment 8
Content: I like Charles and what he does and the ada community are good people. However, the article is incorrect. Just as an example, I will use Elrond (eGLD) to compareLook at how much money was invested into both of these projects from the start. Elrond only had 5 million to fund it from the ground up though the binance launchpad. I'm not sure what Ada's actual number is but I've heard it was anywhere between $300 million and upwards to a billion dollars or more. Please let me know as I would like the current number and will update my post. There is nothing wrong with having more Capital funding from the beginning (bootstrapping) but it does take away from the decentralized aspect to certain degree but again this is very common and isn't something of a concern per say. Secondly how many nodes does cardano have? I don't know anymore...it's something that should be discussed in great detail in the article. Elrond has 3200 nodes, each node validating the blockchain. To say there is an x amount of wallets that are not connected to a venture capitalist or other large entity is misleading. Most venture capitalists use thousands of wallets same with whales. It's more for a security and a redundancy in case one of the wallets gets compromised. Both projects are amazing. The communities are very similar actually, I think 25% or more of eGLD holders have ADA. Both have amazing CEOs and have their own spin on mass adoption via decentralization. Elrond's beautiful solution is Maiar wallet. It is elrond's gateway for the unbanked. The beauty of this is as long as you have a smartphone you can send crypto to anybody who has a phone number without having to understand anything about blockchain or security or at least 99% less. Let that sink in... I can send anyone anywhere around the world eGLD, ETH and BNB, as an example, by just knowing their phone number and hero tag. This is a game changer. Another thing that elrond did to gain my respect was that their maiar launchpad tokens and maiar exchange tokens(mex) where all given to holders only. It is 100% Community owned. Not one was given to a venture capitalist or team member. If that is not a good example of decentralization I do not know what is. Amazing...The future is extremely bright for decentralization and both of these projects deserve to be looked at. However the article actually does ada injustice by assuming wallets are not in the hands of the few. That is definitely not a good metric to look at. I personally would say look at how much has been invested into each of the projects from a hedge fund/VC aspect during their bootstrapping phases and how many nodes they have.

Cardano will be valued based on hard work, real world use and the utility of the platform. I’m not here to make day traders rich. I’m here to change the world” - Charles Hoskinson","
Comment 1
Content: My 2cents on this : I have been watching a lot of Charles videos and I think what he means is that if you want to invest today and get rich tomorrow then it’s not the right place for you. He is not dumb, he knows that most of people want to make money, but he also wants people to make money while serving a good purpose. If Cardano changes the world, then don’t you think ADA price will by default go very high? I believe Ada is a token you just Hodl and sleep. You’ll get rich In 2025, unless something crazy happens. But if it gets adopted by countries, and the tech is solid, you should be patient, if you are not, then maybe you need to just trade. Buy dip, sell top, invest in another crypto dip. Repeat


Comment 2
Content: What’s with the bird? Why would that boost prices?!


Comment 3
Content: 🐦 up.


Comment 4
Content: I see so much speculation in this space, and a far road from actual adoption.But from ALL the time I have spent digging into projects and investing in crypto and other markets Cardano just stands out. It reminds me of ETH in 2015, and an entire ecosystem of potential. The thing that really hooked me with Cardano is the hunger here. The community is hungry for Cardano's success, and there are so many brilliant minds building in May on testnet preparing for the June launch.The price will come once Cardano starts eating chunks out of the market cap of ETH. It is not too far fetched to think that it would.Conversely, what is more out of touch with reality is to think that ETH and Bitcoin will remain the top two coins in this space forever, and competition won't come along. Every market has competition, every number 2, eventually falls to number 3. Nothing remains static in ANY power dynamic. Whether it be political power, or a companies dominance in a market. What do I see ADA priced in 2025? I think it is truly sink or swim for ADA, it absolutely will NOT be priced at the 1-2 dollar level with smart contracts, Dexes, Dapps, ERC20 convertors, NFT capabilities, and government contracts on-boarding people into the ecosystem. It seems highly improbable. 2021 is a make or break year though. I hope great projects come to the ecosystem, and I hope June in the month that people stop calling Cardano ""Vaporware or Ghost Chain"", they have the best fundamentals in this entire space hands down.


Comment 5
Content: It’s wayyy better for the founder to care about what he does as a passion rather than money maker when it’s an emerging technology... no half ass attempts and no cutting corners, that is is the foundation of a GOOD long term investment. I believe in ADA and I also believe in investing in ADA for a return.

Comment 4
Content: Niceeee. More recognition is what ADA deserves.


Comment 5
Content: In terms of branding, Cardano has a kind of Apple in the 90s and early 2000s vibe. Different, smart, kind of elitist. Advertising in The NY Times kinda fits with that. Back then, those of us who used Apple products instead of PCs got made fun of. Then Apple created iPods and iPhone and iPad and became a much larger brand. Just saying.


Comment 6
Content: If this trajectory continues, Cardano is going to end up being more popular on traditional financial/media outlets than ones that are crypto oriented due to coordinated FUD and lack of coverage. Which ... is fine by me. Traditional finance still has most of the money right now.

(if i am already stakeing and earning some) maybe also note: there are no ADA giveaways - thats a scam no one will double your ADA if you give them some ADA before hand - thats a scam


Comment 4
Content: 4. How to get rewardsYou don't actually give your ADA to an individual or a group (this might create confusion in people's minds thinking they are giving away control of their ADA). It's more akin to voting (higher ADA equals higher voting power) to the stake pool operator to process transactions happening on the Cardano blockchain. Your ADA never leaves your wallet, you are in total control of your ADA.


Comment 5
Content: Thank you!! Give this person a medal!!


Comment 6
Content: Since there is a limited supply of ADA, what happens when there is no more to give out for rewards for staking? Did I miss that part?


Comment 7
Content: Does it really matter what pool you choose? Seems like they make this more confusing than it needs to be. Some other crypto I have is just automatic I'm confused by this whole process


Comment 8
Content: Nice, thank you! Can you add a section that talks about tax implications staking has? For example in a lot of countries in Europe every single staking reward has to be converted to it's fiat value at the time of receiving. You have to pay tax on this profits.


Comment 9
Content: What is the minimum amount of ADA i can start staking with?


Comment 10
Content: Is there a minimum amount of ADA to stake? I mean if you had something like 100 ADA would it even be worth it to stake or wait til you get more? When you get your rewards does it go to your wallet or towards your stake?Edit- ok so just type in Cardano calculator and it will tell you the amount you would receive yearly if you staked. So 100 ada is like 4.6 ada per year

Comment 2
Content: I dream of a day where crypto becomes rugged and not bipolar or tied to tweets.


Comment 3
Content: I took the opportunity to buy into Cardano. I’m glad to be a part of this project.


Comment 4
Content: Why did he tank Tesla in 2020 saying it was overbought and then went and split the shares? Just the same shit going on here with Bitcoin


Comment 5
Content: Hopefully he invest in POS coins such as Cardano; until then im not happy with him. He should know little guys are moving to crypto. This was done on purpose, why announce you invested in BTC a few months then pull this crap? He knew about POW and the cost it takes to mine bitcoin. Lost so much respect for him today.


Comment 6
Content: You all hate him today but you only lost money if you sold. Now you have a chance to buy in cheap again and ride the wave back up. A month from now you'll all be talking about the gains you made from buying this dip..


Comment 7
Content: Funny how Cardano's price is tanking when it's literally the exact opposite of what this tweet is concerned about lmao


Comment 8
Content: Umm... no, things are seldom as noble as that, I am afraid. Let's ""shave"" this story with Occam's Razor: Elon Musk's \[Doge+BTC\] hype &spike secured him free funding for his companies without any kind of obligation to pay it back. After raking in the funds, he's disengaging from the whole affair on the rather trendy basis of... ""energy & environmental concerns"" . (The fact that ""energy & environmental concerns"" made their appearance after Musk's raking in the funds may be construed as ... pure coincidence, no doubt.)


Comment 9
Content: Lol this from the guys who relies on fucking lithium mining for his cars. Tone deaf as fuck.Musk is fucking with us. He’s just testing to see how much real power he has over the market. Honestly, if this doesn’t stop soon I’m pulling out entirely just like I did when I realized there are literally no stocks you can buy that don’t fuck over poor people as a best practice.

Comment 7
Content: He's has a lot of good ideas, but him running for politician feels very opportunist to me. (Anytime any kind of celebrity with no political experience decides to run for office I'm always weary of the motives) He has great business ideas, but I also want a politician with a firm understanding of social issues, to be frank I think he may be a little bit out of touch in that regard. But so far it seems he like he has good intentions. I don't even live in California so my opinion means nothing here.


Comment 8
Content: His chance of winning is less than 1%, but he should start by bringing Charles on his YouTube channel at least


Comment 9
Content: Looking at his website, he has possibly the least democratic positions of any Democrat I have ever seen

Comment 2
Content: EVERYONE needs to watch this. Doge is going to hurt a bunch of people, and more than likely the type of people that can't afford one more financial problem, and it can absolutely lead to a clamp down on the entire crypto-sphere. I hope and pray that it just slowly starts to fall and people have a chance to jump out. If it climbs a little more and then has a flash-crash, it will be horrible for every single project on the market.


Comment 3
Content: Everyone is missing the fact that that Elon and all the institutions want regulation brought in to cover their investment in bitcoin. Doge is just the scapegoat.


Comment 4
Content: I'm happy people made profit but hearing charles talk about it definitely made me think about the damage it could bring to crypto as a whole, wise words

Comment 7
Content: it’s gonna crash so hard


Comment 8
Content: I believe most people simply don't understand what Doge is. It gets promoted by Musk on Twitter and now a lot of people probably think it's the greatest shit ever. Just buy Doge and soon you will get a Tesla in exchange. Maybe that's the mindset. Anyway, I even kind of get the joke. Yes, it is funny buying this meme for a few bucks. You can laugh about it in a few years. Dogecoin is the Magikarp of cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, we are at a point where people will lose their life savings and this is not fun anymore.


Comment 9
Content: Calling DOGE the only bubble is silly, the entirety of the stock and crypto markets is in a bull bubble right now. DOGE is just a symptom, and possibly the start of the next bear market.

Why is the manager of a supposedly large investment fund still running this small and terribly reviewed business?I'm calling it now, there will be a significant catalyst fund proposal from AskTheDoctor or FD7 Ventures, it will get approved, and they will run away with the money with nothing to show for it.[https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/askthedoctor.com](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/askthedoctor.com)[https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lvdxmh/fd7\_ventures\_scepticism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lvdxmh/fd7_ventures_scepticism/) PS: ""Africa here we come"" - wtf is that?

Comment 10
Content: Stop. Cardano will take over Ethereum. That 2.0 patch will not work. Once you launch a crypto it can’t be modified. You can come up with another coin but it will set you back years. Cardano is well thought out. We are in stage 2 of 5. It’s gonna go through the roof once Smart Contract is implemented.

Comment 2
Content: I dont want to be a party breaker but Ethereum is account-based blockchain so the tx volume is real but Cardano is utxo based blockchain which means that total transaction volumes is inflated with change outputs. Also, this absolutely doesn't take into consideration the transfer of other digital assets (tokens) where the ETH value is usually 0 but the value transferred can be huge.On our wallet AdaLite, the ratio between the volume of ""ADA Sent"" and ""Total ADA in Outputs"" is roughly 1:15 so I would say that if you want to calculate how much ADA was transferred, you need to divide the total ADA in outputs with 15 which makes it only around 1bil. For noobs: >Transactions in Cardano have at least one input and usually at least two outputs. Your funds are stored on your addresses in form of unspent transaction outputs (utxo) - imagine each utxo as a pile of coins. When you are creating a transaction, the wallet will choose one (or more if necessary) of these piles of coins on and use it as an input for a transaction. In the transaction the utxo (or the combined multiple utxos) are then split into two new utxos - one of them is going to the receiver address (this is the funds you are really sending to somebody) and the rest (called change) is going to one of your addresses (called change addresses) and remains in your possession.

Comment 3
Content: I'm one of these new folks. The following just occurred to me: I started following the occasional articles on bitcoin and blockchain a decade ago or so, and I thought it was awesome but I focused on the blockchain aspect and was too timid to buy into the bitcoin itself. Then I started developing on Ethereum five years ago, but still thought ehhh I don't know if I want to put my money there. Wrong for the second time. After a reddit r/cardano post popped up several days ago, I started reading about it and thought the project looked rad.&#x200B;I bought some ADA the other day. I don't think that means anything special, I'm certainly nobody special, but I like what this community looks like so far and I decided to participate.

Suffice to say, I regret not being more involved in the Cardano community especially on this subreddit, I never really checked in because even with the limited engagement I had, the people on this sub were top notch/top tier who always kept their head down and focused on educating through the facts and technical knowledge on ADA's developments. I really had no worries about the future and success of Cardano because of the quality of the community, even just at a glance, and knew it was just a waiting game for me.

When I first heard the news, I felt this would be a huge game-changer, especially because it solves a very real problem for digitizing fiat currencies. Being able to pay fees in native tokens will change the landscape of crypto forever.Imagine that you're new to crypto and you're wanting to move some stablecoins into your wallet. At the moment, your only real option is to buy ETH and USDT, and then pay an arbitrary amount of gas to move them. Better keep some more ETH stashed away too, otherwise you might struggle to move the coins when you need them. At the current market rate, better make that a decent chunk of ETH. Overall, this is a terrible user experience.Cardano essentially just made it possible to buy a stablecoin from an exchange and instantly send it to a wallet. You only pay the fees in stablecoin. No need to buy and hold Ada. This user experience is perfect for mass adoption.One of the major criticisms around digitizing currency in African nations was the idea that the unbanked would find it confusing to need to purchase and maintain an ADA balance in order to transact in their nation's official currency. As best I can tell, that hurdle has now been removed. \-- If you're interested in joining a Discord server for Cardano, we've got one set up here: [https://discord.gg/QVtun96237](https://discord.gg/QVtun96237)

https://i.redd.it/4mu4twn0bhl61.png,Cardano is now 90% decentralized! With an ETA of 100% decentralization on March 31st. That is in 25 days! We Are Moving Right Along!,"
Comment 1
Content: The 90% means that of all new blocks being made 90% of them are made by stake pool operators and that the remaining 10% of blocks being made are made by IOHK/IOG pools that are centralized/federated. Once the D parameter hits .0 it will mean all new blocks made after that point are made by stake pool operators and Cardano will be 100% decentralized. The increase in decentralized stake pools making new blocks means more pools that have made new blocks will be able to share the staking rewards to users that have delegated to them. \-----""On more traditional blockchains, blocks are produced by miners. But Cardano uses a more sophisticated mechanism known as Ouroboros Praos. Instead of miners, we have stakers. The more ADA you have, the more stake you hold.Now, to maximize security, we want as many people staking as possible. But not everyone has the necessary skills or equipment to setup a node and have it running 24/7, so Cardano also has a delegation mechanism.Instead of producing blocks yourself, you have to the option to delegate your staking power to a stakepool. The pool will produce blocks for you, and you get to keep (most) of the rewards.There's no technical downside to staking. It's not possible to lose any ADA. Your ADA is never locked up. The ADA never leaves your wallet, so there's no security concerns.Don't stress too much about picking a pool. Pretty much any unsaturated pool with low fees will give you the best rewards. Oversaturated pools or pools with high fees will probably give lesser rewards.Picking a pool that you trust can be a good choice, because your delegation is your endorsement of that pool. You trust that they will be a good block producer and think that they will be responsible with your stake."" Credit u/FASTstakepool\----What is the D Parameter?

Comment 3
Content: I was expecting to hit 100% earlier. Hopefully, Coinbase will list ADA soon after reaching 100% decentralization.


Comment 4
Content: I've been watching ADA evolve here. And seeing the amazing things it has and will become. But my question is why is there still so much drama around the damn coin? Several apps don't let you buy it, several do but won't let you send them, and other don't let you convert to or from.Plus, I may be just a big fan here, but why doesn't everyone know about this yet?With the tech behind this, people should be shouting CARDANO from the rooftops! What gives?


Comment 5
Content: The decentralisation of cardano is a fixed timeframe. Each epoch 2% more gets decentralised. So we already know the date that we will hit 100%


Comment 6
Content: What are the implications about 100% decentralization on the cost of ADA, development, etc


Comment 7
Content: If I read all above my simple conclusion as a newbie about decentralization.1. Get a decent hardware / software wallet2. Buy your crypto on an exchange.3. Withdraw your crypto as fast as possible to an personal wallet 4. Stake your crypto to support and secure a network (avoid exchanges to stake for you), start a node or hodl and use it to buy something Missing something?


Comment 8
Content: For the Cardano network to become truly decentralized, it will require not only the distributed infrastructure introduced during the Shelley era but also the capacity to be maintained and improved over time in a decentralized way. To that end, the Voltaire era will add the ability for network participants to present Cardano improvement proposals that can be voted on by stakeholders, leveraging the already existing staking and delegation process.

Comment 2
Content: I disagree. If everyone could continue to panic for a few more months it would really give me enough time to stockpile at low prices!


Comment 3
Content: Cardano is one of those rare projects where I'd feel perfectly comfortable taking a vacation and not even checking on it because I know it's a stable long-term project on a good track. Let the dips happen, let the bullruns happen, this is crypto. You know what you signed up for. My advice is to not get overly emotional, let patience and common sense guide your investments. Don't spend more than you can afford to lose and just HODL for the long term. There was once a time when people panicked because Bitcoin went from like $5 down to $4.


Comment 4
Content: [deleted]


Comment 5
Content: Such a fair weather sub. When the price is up, everyone is like ""it's not about the money, it's about the future."" Then the price is down and half the comments are trying to blame Charles for hinting about ""little birds"" and getting everyone hyped. Honestly just cash out and invest in BTC if you're in the latter group.


Comment 6
Content: Crypto market will crypto market. Anyone not excited by these dips is invested in the wrong space


Comment 7

Comment 2
Content: We dont want one winner in any market, thats how things get over priced.Happy to have a good competitiveness in the market.And yes cardano ecosystem will at least equal eth at some point but it could be 5 years away or more


Comment 3
Content: does it need to?why does everything have to be about something overtaking another, there is plenty of room for both to work together


Comment 4
Content: No. Ethereum will always exist, because it’s great. Cardano will also always exist, because it’s also (going to be) great. One doesn’t have to cancel the other, they can coexist peacefully. Crypto tribalism needs to go, we need less Neanderthal and more decentralized appreciation for nice things.

Content: Not included in the highlights above, but Charles makes a fantastic quotation at 12:50 in the [original video](https://youtu.be/KfADQiZ4zgw?t=770):>I don’t want to live, and I don’t think you want to live, in a world where we had the chance for each and every person to live better, but we robbed it from them because it was too inconvenient to participate in a political process and create political cost for robbing it from us. **Indifference is the greatest evil because it enables the greatest evil, and we are all to blame if we are indifferent.**

Very nice staff at Ben Cardin's office they said they will pass my request on asap, Chris Van Hollen call went to voicemail.

Comment 5
Content: I made a point of emphasizing in some pretty hostile waters re: ADA today the fact that they should pay attention to Charles and objectively watch in his most recent video how he's fighting tooth and nail to protect the industry as a whole. In effect, fighting for the money of the those who spread FUD and mistruths about Cardano (but he does so anyway because he loves the industry and isn't focused on tribalism; he simply wants it to succeed). Hope the haters frekin wake up already, get a life and realize this guy is to be respected (you don't have to invest in ADA) but show some darn respect already for what he is trying to achieve so we all can continue to propel this tech forward.PS. It sure is good to break through that pesky 1.40; I know its because of BTC but hey still good to see.

Comment 2
Content: I'm kind of lukewarm on this sort of chart. The info is easy to cherry-pick, and claims like ""Work in Progress for 4 years, no ETA"" is unnecessarily catty against Eth. Appreciate the effort, but not sure this is helpful.


Comment 3
Content: Energy Consumption/Year but on the right the chart gives W and not Wh... Triggered


Comment 4
Content: Energy consumption per year needs to be scaled to something like number of transactions or number of users. Otherwise, of course a much smaller coin has much lower power usage.


Comment 5
Content: Hmm seems pointless this graph. I dont like disrespecting other cryptos, we are all aboard projects because we believe in their capabilities if we don't like other projects we dont invest. This is just playground stuff tbh do it in 5 years when Cardano actually has a network running on it like eth and we shall see which is better.

However, the Chinese name of Cardano, which is 卡尔达诺, is very bad in terms of marketing.## Why is that?First of all, 卡尔达诺（Ka er da nuo）is a translated word based on the pronunciation of Cardano, an English word, and it's too long to be a good brand name.Let me show you some good examples. The Chinese name of Bitcoin is 比特币 instead of the verbal version 比特科因; Ethereum is 以太坊 instead of 以色利因; Polkadot is 波卡 instead of 坡卡多特.Secondly, 卡尔达诺 is hard to pronounce in Chinese, like a tongue twister.Finally, 卡尔达诺 is meaningless in Chinese. On the other hand, my grandma can understand 比特币（Bitcoin）is some kind of money and 以太坊（Ethereum）is some kind of workshop. While 卡尔达诺，nothing, maybe some kind of food made of sticky rice.## My Advice卡达路（ka da lu）Its pronunciation is close to Cardano and the final character 路 means ""road"" in Chinese as Cardano as a smart contract platform will connect many dApps and users like a road.And also, in Taiwan, ""network"" is called 网路, which means ""road for net"", so I think 卡达路 would be a good choice.

Two years, thousands of GitHub commits, and hundreds of hours of study later, the first version of Cardano shipped in September 2017, and the Byron era began.## The Eras of Cardano* **Byron - Foundation (COMPLETE)** * Allowed users to buy and sell the ADA cryptocurrency. * Ouroboros is the first proof-of-stake protocol created on the basis of academic research, with a mathematically proven level of security. * The Byron era also saw the delivery of the Daedalus wallet as well as the Yoroi wallet (lighter wallet) * During the Byron era, the network was federated.&#x200B;* **Shelley - Decentralisation (COMPLETE)** * The majority of nodes are run by network participants making Cardano more decentralised and enjoying greater security and robustness as a result. * Introduction of a delegation and incentives scheme. * A reward system to drive stake pools and community adoption. * The delegation and incentive scheme allows and encourages users to delegate their stake to stake pools – always-on, community-run network nodes – and be rewarded for honest participation in the network. * The Shelley era makes the network more useful, rewarding, and valuable for users. * Shelley was designed to prepare the community for a fully distributed network, a new DApp ecosystem and much more. &#x200B;* **Goguen - Smart contracts (UNDERWAY)** * Smart contracts! The Shelley era decentralised the network, the Goguen era is set to add the ability to build decentralised apps on the Cardano network. * Developers have been working on Goguen in tandem with Shelley. When complete, everyone, no matter their technical capabilities, or lack thereof, will be able to create and execute functional smart contracts on the Cardano network. * Plutus, a purpose-built smart contract development language and execution platform using the functional programming language Haskell is one of the major goals of this era. Plutus is already available for testing and allows one codebase to support both on and off-chain components. * [Marlowe](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/) is a way to make Cardano accessible to a wider, less technical userbase, allowing them to create smart contracts. * [Marlowe Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/en/marlowe/tools/marlowe-playground/) is an easy-to-use application-building platform that non-programmers can use to build financial smart contracts. * In short, Marlowe + Plutus = more real-world implementation. * Goguen will also see the addition of a multi-currency ledger enabling users to create new natively-supported tokens. * This will allow the creation of fungible and non-fungible tokens, support for the creation of new cryptocurrencies on Cardano as well as the tokenisation of many types of digital and physical assets, as well as easier integration of smart contracts and DApps involving multiple cryptocurrencies.&#x200B;* **Basho - Scaling (TO COME)** * This era seeks to optimise, improve the scalability and interoperability of the Cardano network. * Basho will see the introduction of sidechains, which are essentially new blockchains interoperable with the main Cardano chain. * These sidechains will extend the capabilities of the network can be used as a sharding mechanism to reduce the load on the main chain, as well as introducing experimental features without affecting the security of the main blockchain. * Introduction of parallel accounting styles, resulting in greater interoperability for Cardano.&#x200B;* **Voltaire - Governance (TO COME)** * Having a decentralised network is only part of the work. There must be an infrastructure in place that will allow for decentralised maintenance and network improvements through stakeholders. * This era will see the formation of a voting and treasury system, allowing network participants to use their stake and voting rights to influence the future development of the network. * The idea is to make Cardano a self-sustaining system. * The treasury system will fund future development of the network by using a fraction of all pooled transaction fees, which are pooled following the voting process. * When this happens, IOHK will have no hand in managing Cardano. It will all be in the hands of the community.As of today, 1st April 2021, over 2,000 community pools are now responsible for 100% of block production. The more blocks made by stake pool operators, the more rewards are earned by those pools and subsequently given to users that have staked their ADA with those pools. Plutus, the platform that will host smart contracts of Cardano is set to deploy between the end of April and the beginning of May. The Alonzo testnet will allow developers to create smart contracts.

Comment 2
Content: De-centralized nodes is not enough for network de-centralization. Those who *own* ADA validate the network transactions and control the votes.Who owns the ADA supply ? Can anyone provide a good analysis showing that the supply is well distributed among a large number of individuals, and not massively controlled by a small group of people.


Comment 3
Content: Not fully decentralized people, that is a misnomer. Full decentralization happens once governance is implemented


Comment 4
Content: It isn't though. Block creation is de-centralized.


Comment 5
Content: thanks u/BreakfastAntelope for the breakdown! i was previously confused the differences of Marlowe, Plutus and Goguen. I really love this Community. if its ok to share i got here following wsb, to dogecoin and looking for quick money. I came in wanting to pump and dump but before i could ever open the accounts and transfer the money necessary i was no longer confident in those investments and happily left them off my portfolio.i read more and more about the coins and there was only one where i felt i could invest and not worry about the price Cardano. Now i don't see how i could even think about selling within the next 5 years. there's only upwards to go.also thanks everyone who contributed and commented on this page to giving me knowledge to stick with it. I'm going to be looking into staking soon and I'm sure there's a wealth of info here on how to do it right :)


Comment 6
Content: The majority of development is done by a single team (IOHK/IOG) who have full governance control and are on Charles Hoskinson’s payroll.This is typical for an early stage crypto project, but it’s very centralised compared to more mature ecosystems.We’ll get there in time, but this title is misleading (actually it’s just a completely false statement designed to create hype).Most crypto projects launch with D=0 from day one (ie. Bitcoin). One of the few exceptions is something like IOTA which continues to have central control elements to stabilise their version of block production.So achieving D=0 isn’t a cause for celebration, it’s a concern that it was launched in a fully centralised way in the first place, but now we’re over that period of history.


Comment 7
Content: Marlowe is absolutely Bonkers ... if you haven't check it out yet, it will blow your mind what Stage programming has achieved.


Comment 8
Content: Newbie question. Is Cardano really the most decentralized chain? By which meassure? I see decentralization needs many independent block minters, but not only, also many independent network full nodes, many independent developers, etc. I only see we got many block minters, and still wonder how independent are they (looking at you multipools...)


Comment 9
Content: Is Ethereum not currently more decentralized by these measures? Please help me understand where I am wrong. Thanks.Cardano* Decentralized block production (2000 PoS block producers)* Centralized development (most devs work for IOHK)* Centralized governanceEthereum* Decentralized block production (tens of thousands of miners)* Decentralized development (most devs work for independent companies)* Centralized governance

Comment 2
Content: Step 6 (choosing a pool) is the hardest and most important part IMO. Could you include more advice about what are good/bad pool metrics, as well as advice about choosing operators? Maybe this warrants its own quick guide. Otherwise the rest looks good!


Comment 3
Content: This is great, but I would add a card to explain how to choose a good pool. One of the hardest part for most people and was not explained


Comment 4
Content: Love it! Just in case you want to fix it, you misspelled annual on one of the final slides.


Comment 5
Content: Noob question incoming. So the 340 ADA fee that gets taken out every epoch (5 days) is spilt amongst every person staking. So if there are 100 people in the pool the fee would be 3.4 ADA each every 5 days?


Comment 6
Content: A buddy of mine said he gets like 30% from daedalus. Did he find an awesome pool our is he greatly mistaken? I have Cardano staked on Kraken that says 4%-6%.

Comment 6
Content: [removed]


Comment 7
Content: Just curious, doesn’t Coinbase allow you to stake your ADA? I have 300 coins there that I am earning 5% on, but maybe that’s something else?


Comment 8
Content: I just downloaded Yoroi the other day, but have yet to move anything over. I originally put my ADA into Exodus Wallet and was staking from there, but it seems to be a pool connected to Exodus; do I understand that right? The return on Exodus Wallet is 4.21%, and I’m definitely seeing higher returns listed in Yoroi. The reason I haven’t moved over to Yoroi is the overwhelming information overload that Yoroi has when it comes to deciding which pool to stake in. A few questions I have in relation to that…1. What does the pool size percentage indicate? How close the pool is to full saturation? And full saturation would mean that the pool is not one to delegate to because oversaturation takes away from decentralization? And would the number under pool size percentage mean? How much is left to put into it for full saturation?2. What are the costs? Is that costs for the pool to verify transactions? What are the numbers under cost?3. And what is the pledge?4. Finally, estimated ROA? Is that based on past returns or projected future returns?Sorry if any of these are stupid questions, I’m still trying to learn!


Comment 9
Content: Yesterday I was thinking about doing it, so I set up the Yoroi wallet (Coinbase is my exchange) and sent some had to use the Authy app security code to make the transfer... But in a few moments BOOM! The staking pool was also a quick success! I am in going long term with ADA 20 plus years at least! Starting off with 2k see what happens when I continue to feed the decentralized system.

The politicians for the Warner amendment are in the banks pockets or have nothing to do with crypto. Those with nothing to with crypto couldn’t care less what happens. That only feeds into the hands of established financial institutions. Crypto has/will be a positive force for changing our financial system. Call/write your representatives. Don’t take this quietly.

Content: The more FUD and hate, the more I add to my bag. Guys we're all gonna fckin make it.


Comment 8
Content: Really inspiring speech! I discovered Cardano pretty late by community standards. I first discovered it earlier this year when the most recent Crypto boom was taking place. I don’t just see ADA as a cryptocurrency though. I see it as the token/key to the future of blockchain. And I firmly believe that while I am later than some in this community…we are all so incredibly early in the grand scheme of things. I see this tech, these tokens, and this community as a whole only becoming stronger and growing exponentially over time. Will it hit $100 per token and flip the rest of the market? No. But it doesn’t have to. We have time on our side, we have smart people working behind the scenes, and we have a great community that’s growing by the day. Genuinely excited for the journey. For me, for you, for all

Comment 10
Content: I watched it before I went to sleep. Just after I bought my first NFT on the Cardano blockchain. And I love it!!! I still sometimes hovering with where I believe in. But Charles hit’s the spot. Keep holding and believing in Cardano! This is the way to go.

Perhaps for context it's useful to see the recent chat I had with [Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW0QZmtbjvs).Let me know if you have questions or specific topics to discuss, technical or philosophical, about concepts or events. Anything goes.PS: I'll do my best to publish the episode a few days after we record it.

Content: How is Charles incorporating Alex Chepurnoy’s Ergo into the Cardano ecosystem? Charles has mentioned him a few times now in his live streams, and the improved PoW of Ergo seems like a great level-up, along with layered Oracle pools.Also, Lex are you slightly excited about Diablo 2 Resurrected? :)Check out r/ergonauts !

Comment 8
Content: I'm new to your show, but I have thoroughly enjoyed your recent conversation with Vitalik, especially the depth-first dives into some issues that came up as the conversation progressed.If you get a chance, I would like to hear Charles' and your thoughts on the emergence of ""reputation"" / ""track-record"" as a resource between pseudonymous actors on the blockchain. I believe that it's becoming an important differentiator between competitors, and a source of trust to drive enhanced cooperation.For example, Cardano's incentive mechanism for staking is designed to converge to a steady state of 500 pools that have most of the stake evenly delegated among them. If you look at the actual stake distribution, you'll see something similar to this long-run equilibrium.What distinguishes these lucky 500 stakepools from their other >1000 peers? They have the most favourable (1) cost margins; (2) owner's pledge (i.e. their skin in the game); (3) support for appealing causes; and (4) they have an established on-chain history of reliably producing blocks with the stake that they were entrusted with. I would argue that the last factor is already the most important, and will only become more so.Another example is DeFi. Currently, most decentralized borrowing is restricted to over-collateralized loans (where the borrower must put up collateral worth more than the loan) or niche things like flash loans. This is the case because only over-collateralized loans can have repayment be guaranteed automatically via a smart contract mechanism (e.g. collateral deposits locked during loan, and automatic liquidation thresholds).What would allow DeFi to expand further into the under-collateralized loans that we can access in the traditional financial system? I think that it would require decentralized identities and credit histories on the blockchain. In other words, it would require reputations to be established for market participants based on their track-records of past performance on financial obligations.A similar pattern is likely to emerge for the political governance of the blockchain, crowd-funding and venture funding of projects, and business inter-relations on the blockchain. It has also been observed in the pseudonymous black markets on the Deep Web: [Hardy and Norgaard (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1744137415000454).I think that this reputational resource is necessary because not all interactions between pseudonymous parties can be mechanised by smart contracts to be automatically compliant with what the parties agreed to. Mechanisation via smart contract requires resources to be locked upfront, whereas for some interactions these resources might not be avaiable upfront (e.g. futures for agricultural produce) or it might be undesirable to lock them upfront (e.g. unsecured loan repayment in the future). If a required resource is not locked up at the beginning of contract execution, then its provision later on remains optional for the party that has to provide it. Such interactions require trust/cooperation between the parties, which is impossible if they are pseudonymous and know nothing about each other. However, this trust can be facilitated by the immutable history of past actions that can be recorded on the blockchain and tied to specific decentralized identities.


Comment 9
Content: Hey lex! Big fan here. Would love for Charles to comment on the vastly growing cardano ecosystem, and what projects he thinks might be the biggest beneficiaries once smart contracts capabilities go live? Thanks!


Comment 10
Content: I would really like to understand what the state of the pilot in Ethiopia is. Specially the capturing of student transcripts to the blockchain. This is such an exciting endeavour and am curious when the rollout to 5M students will happen.

https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/n9chka/i_live_in_tanzania_and_i_believe_cardano_has_a/,I live in Tanzania 🇹🇿 and I believe Cardano has a very real future in Africa. And sooner than some might think.,"I am a South African 🇿🇦 American 🇺🇸 living in Tanzania 🇹🇿 Very excited to hear about the Cardano deal in Ethiopia 🇪🇹 This project has massive potential for many reasons, but I want to shed some light on a few important factors that I believe will contribute to its success. Firstly, I think many people outside East Africa don't realize just how widespread mobile payment systems already are. Tanzania is one of the world leaders in mobile payment adoption at over 40% of citizens. Furthermore, quite a small fraction of people currently use the traditional banking system because it is only really cost effective for the wealthy. Also, the median age in all of Africa is 18 years old, and as low as 15 years old in some countries. Population is exploding, and I think it's fair to say that young people are generally more open minded and innovative. Lastly, the newly created African Continental Free Trade Area is a very exciting development... ""The objective of the agreement is to create a single continental market for goods and services, with free movement of business people and investments."" For these reasons, I truly believe that Africa will continue to develop quickly as a central power in the fintech world. Tanzania in particular is a wonderful place to call home, and I hope many of you can come to visit one day. You might end up making your future here like me! Peace and love everyone.

Comment 2
Content: I'm Zambian and cardano Is the way to bypass corruption. We had a minister in Lusaka arrested with $200k in a barrel. Judge let him go because no evidence of corruption. Cardano is the way. Barrel was found hidden in a hole on his land. Almost all African presidents have higher yearly incomes than the US and UK leaders..it's sick.


Comment 3
Content: Super interesting point about the median age in Africa. I read an analysis of various revolutions and the median age was a huge factor. The younger the population, the more likely a revolution would succeed. In this case, may it be a peaceful, technological revolution that ends up raising the standard of living.

Comment 5
Content: I am Tanzanian and must say, once you send a link to the video they did on Partnership with Tanzania. More and more people are interested and ended up learning about crypto. It's a movement! ❤️🇹🇿


Comment 6
Content: I can think of nothing more exciting than Cardano being the ""infrastructure Ethereum"" and leapfrogging underdeveloped areas into the 21st century and possibly ahead of countries like the US that refuse to update their infrastructure because of bureaucracy/corruption/complacency. Big things coming for this project in the next few months/years

Content: Charles is looking more and more like a Rabbi.


Comment 3
Content: Charles' AMAs are great, but IMO cutting them into these cultish sounding bite-sized chunks is doing him a disservice. You lose a bunch of context around it.This is probably why outside of the Cardano sphere people are skeptical about Charles. I implore everyone to listen to his AMAs and treat it like a podcast. It is very educational for those who wants to learn about blockchains and the theories behind it.


Comment 4
Content: I have yet to hear how PoS will be able to NOT be taken over by an oligarchy. I have been with ADA since the beginning, and since the beginning it seems like Charles has been saying that they are “looking in to” how to keep ADA from being controlled by a few elites, but I’ve still never heard an actual solution. If anyone can point me to how ADA will address this, please do!

Content: I did my part.


Comment 7
Content: Just some details about this:1. Play Store been a shitshow for some time now, sometimes it even seen that google don't care about it anymore.2. Play Store automatically delete bad reviews (in a day or two) that it detect as potencial bots trying to bring down a app. Try to leave a decent review and it might not get deleted.3. I read that every time this wallet is taken down, a new account upload it and get a lot of reviews via bots, so it might not be a permanent solution.

Comment 2
Content: Thanks for this message. Even if they won’t be the next developer, they may be new to investing, still don’t know much about blockchain, or could even be a child that is still developing their capacity and ability to understand how to learn or where to look. They could even be foreigners in the developing world with little access to information.


Comment 3
Content: I came across multiple high and ultra high net individuals. They often have a lack of the base foundation and just start asking strange and simple questions. After they got it they'll actually be very efficient (with the given information). So said, if someone asks a almos dumb question remember that it could be his last puzzle to a gigantic thing.


Comment 4
Content: I run a stake pool (with partners). We tried contributing to the community with an informative YouTube Channel, but we were awful (my opinion - I feel like “I” was awful the most). So we stopped. We do give to charity. But I decided the best way to help the community is responding to as many posts as I can in this (and other) forum(s). I answer all the posts that people respond “DYOR” or “stop being a moonboy” to. I help support any person that talks about getting scammed, rather than tell them “they were an idiot”. I help them learn about stake pools without recommending mine. I just try to be very friendly and positive to everybody, ESPECIALLY new people and people with 24 ADA to their name. That’s how I’m contributing to the community! Be helpful and passing it on!


Comment 5
Content: I couldn't agree more. This sub was nothing but welcoming when I happened upon it a few months ago. Everyone has always answered my questions (and they were as simple as can get) and it really led me to further invest in cardano and get some friends on board. ""DYOR"" isn't as easy for everyone - I've been in other crypto subs where someone will ask a straight forward question and someone will tell them to go read the white paper lol - I have loved this community and hope it stays great


Comment 6
Content: I appreciate this post. I am completely new to crypto (and Reddit and Twitter). I am 59 years old and have a lifetime of experience, education and various information in this brain of mine. Unfortunately, not any of it was related to this space- my ignorance was impressive. But as I continue to educate myself, the responses to questions (not necessarily my own) in this sub have been invaluable. I appreciate those of you who take the time to provide clear, instructive answers to questions that may seem quite basic to you but are not to many of us noobs.


Comment 7
Content: Personally almost everything of true value that I have learnt about crypto and it’s ecosystems has been through reddit ...I am constantly in awe of the OGs who are patient, kind and humble as they guide and nurture newcomers ..we all started somewhere and none of us would be here if not for these awesome contributors across many communities..thank you u/9tailedOwl and all the others like you!


Comment 8
Content: Exactly. Who knows, you could help someone out that is on the verge of investing a large amount into Cardano and be part of the movement that drives the currency up. Then that person could be helping someone else. Domino effect people. Already got two people from work into Cardano with 10K investment. I help out anyone I could because I remember a month ago, I was exactly like those people who had no knowledge.


Comment 9
Content: Agreed. Cardano’s growth depends on new users. Seeing people commenting smugly reduces the chance a new user will stick around.I myself posted something recently that people were saying was helpful and useful, and I deleted it because it started attracting smug comments.Here’s hoping a post like this will convince people like me to consider posting ideas without fear of people being contrary just to be contrary and “own” someone.Finally, if someone is asking a question that’s been asked a million times, either answer it again, use the comment commands, or if you really don’t want to, just keep scrolling by and someone else will answer. It might seem annoying to see the same questions all the time, but remember: the person asking is thinking about it for the first time.If we’re really serious about being the future of crypto for everyone, professionalism must be paramount to ensure we don’t needlessly hinder our own attractiveness.


Comment 10
Content: Yes, I think the best way to contribute to the community would be to educate people. This in turn spreads awareness and keeps people safe from being scammed now and/or in the future.

For example, the latest news on their site are from December '20. Meanwhile Q1 '21 is already in the rear view mirror. Where are the updates?I have seen arguments claiming that NDAs or sensitivity of the deals they are working on, prevent them from commenting. That makes sense to a point but it's not a good answer. They could still comment on the number, type, completion status and broad geography of those deals without giving away any specifics.This post is to petition the CF to produce quarterly reports to the community covering things like:- ADA holdings and other reserves at start of quarter and end of quarter- headcount broken down by type (marketing, content, legal, SMEs, engineers, etc...) and employment status (contract/full-time)- major expenses Inc people- sub-contracting partnerships- documents and/or code produced- partnerships/deals signed- overview of deals pipeline: broad description of what deals are in progress in a way that does not violate NDAs or risk the dealsIf you agree please upvote for visibility and community pressure@IOG @Emurgo, can you help us with this?

Comment 2
Content: i couldn't agree more. Last time i posted something like some news from Frederik Gregaard would be in order, I got tarred and feathered due to my supposed ""lack of patience"". CH himself often cites his extreme lack of patience but we need to sit tight and shut up.Meanwhile the lack of communication from CF is pretty deafening. And that transparency you ask for was actually promised by the still new CEO if anyone took the time to actually watch/listen to his interviews. It was a core value he brought forward.The argument around NDAs is BS. There's clearly material to communicate on when you have people and make progress. Sure, certain announcements need to be kept under wraps (except if you are CH then you can tweet about birds and leak out info) until they are closed, but surely there are things to post about here as well as on other social platforms.


Comment 3
Content: Hi u/UbikKosmil1 and everyone else in this thread,My name is Eva Oberholzer, Chief Growth Officer and Member of the Management Board of the **Cardano Foundation**. I joined the Foundation 6 month ago, together with Frederik Gregaard, our new CEO.Thank you for the strong interest you show in the Cardano Foundation and our progress – I fully accept the need for more information and greater transparency. I hope I can shed some light and clarify certain questions with my answer – my team and I are making a big effort to connect with the community on a more personal level, and this feels like a great place to start.Over the last few months, we’ve been working on building the right basis for us as an organization and team to support an exponentially growing ecosystem with many-faceted needs. In addition, we’ve been working on various projects we belief add value to our network such as a first supply chain traceability and anti-counterfeit solution on Cardano, exchange integrations especially after the Mary Hardfork and the successful onboarding of the latest important platform a few weeks ago (you probably all know the name). Moreover, we support SPOs in connecting to mission-driven projects (therefore released a report about mission driven pools last week), built an exchange monitoring tool and are working on a new developer portal, faster scam takedown mechanism etc.One thing we are still busy working on and haven't yet completed is the realignment and optimization of our communication activities. This is extremely frustrating for me and my team, as we have many things to tell – not only as Cardano but also as the Cardano Foundation – but are not fully geared up to do so yet. We are in the process of gradually streamlining our communication channels and adding more talent and skills to the team to be more vocal, visible and transparent in the future (we'll be happy to make some concrete announcements in 2 weeks).This has to do with the fact that we have grown as an organization within a very short period of time and that the community is also getting bigger and bigger. It currently feels like we're building and flying an airplane at the same time.In fact, we communicate most updates, articles and news on the Cardano Forum. We choose the forums as it’s the highest trafficked blog-style site of the wider Cardano ecosystem. You are correct though, we do need to raise our profile, and we do need to update our website more frequently. You have my assurance that this will change soon. Please check back on [Cardanofoundation.org](https://Cardanofoundation.org) in a few weeks to see our progress there.In the meantime, find below some additional helpful links related to the conversations:General updates / Cardano Forum: [https://forum.cardano.org/c/english/announcements/13](https://forum.cardano.org/c/english/announcements/13)Info on genesis distribution: [https://cardano.org/genesis/](https://cardano.org/genesis/)Info on current ada holdings: [https://pool.pm/cf](https://pool.pm/cf)Regarding pipeline, the Cardano Foundation spends a great deal of its time liaising with enterprises and institutions. This is where NDAs become incredibly frustrating, and I really do understand your interest here. What I will say is, that if you want to hear us talk about in-the-pipeline partnerships, you can rest assured that we want to tell you—in fact it’s incredibly hard not to shout about our progress and tell our community all of the stakeholders we have been talking to!However, it’s a bad idea for us to share information on potential pipeline deals and partnerships for a few key reasons. Number one, is these deals always move at a pace that is much slower than many in our community will realize, and may even take years to reach fruition. Secondly, we do not wish to hype our community until such deals have indeed come to fruition. Take for example the live supply chain tracking solution our Exchange and Integrations team developed in association with Scantrust. This solution went live this week (the first ever live use of Cardano for enterprise-grade solutions), but the initial discussions took place over a year ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos, 2020.The Cardano Foundation is not as big as IOHK, nor are we structured the same way. The work that IOHK does is invaluable and its contributions to Cardano are manifold. At the Cardano Foundation, we have under 30 full-time staff. Our community is large, so we need to make sure we are properly positioned to fulfil our role and traditional mission as a guardian and guide. In order to do that, we need the right team, means and infrastructure.Our job openings are all communicated on our website, so are our current team members. In addition, we openly announce and portrait new joiners and, if relevant for the community, inform, if someone is leaving.There're some great stories and updates we can't wait to share with you in the coming weeks. It is of utmost importance to me and the team to communicate more openly and purposefully with all of you, and we are working hard to achieve this. Please revisit our website in a few weeks time again and assess the status.Thanks for your support and effort, Eva

Comment 2
Content: This is why I feel differently about ADA than the way I do about the vast majority of other crypto projects. There's a confluence of factors that point to this as the third step in the BTC, ETH progression. Their team committed to a slow and steady progression instead of a pump and dump. The platform can solve the ETH gas fee problem. Charles was one of the original creators of ETH.Definitely a long term play, like buying BTC at 1k.

But I think it's good to at least reflect on how the current price of ADA compares to the rest of the crypto world at certain times.To me, today is yet another example of the the continued strength and increased adoption of Cardano. It's not really reliant or tied to the movement of BTC or ETH anymore.I saw hints of this earlier this year during Cardano's big breakout in January... but then it started trending with BTC. But not today!EDIT: I can agree maybe “crash” wasn’t the right word. Correction, adjustment, deep red day... call it what you want, you know what I mean 😎

Comment 9
Content: Wasn't a crash, but ADA certainly stood alone in the chaos. I don't think it was because of the energy efficiency. Most skittish traders don't know much about coins, generally speaking. I think it's the followers holding out. Most ADA is staked so they are banking something no matter what. Being an ""affordable"" coin in the top 10 does a lot for new buyers not fully understanding the ecosystem.

Comment 3
Content: It's definitely an interesting project. I'd be impressed if it runs smoothly.


Comment 4
Content: It's interesting how this post got many comments about how blockchain can be used outside of finance. Isn't this one of the main goals of IOHK? To ineract with blockchain without even noticing it. I mean they talk about RealFi in Africa. I guess it's very interesting and blockchain has many use cases if it's made correctly but the blockchain shouldn't even be interesting to average Joe. It's like the internet you simply use it and most likely aren't interested in its technology but its utility. I feel like a lot of people miss this in the current state of the blockchain industry. But in the end this is the only important thing and I feel like a lot of projects aren't really focused on real utility but some self-invented use cases which don't even need to be solved on blockchain. Sure DeFi is a legitimate use case but everyone is doing it. I'm in Cardano for some RealFi!


Comment 5
Content: Real life application of smart contract outside of defi? Interesting.


Comment 6
Content: This would likely be bigger for Cardano than we could ever imagine.


Comment 7
Content: I’ve had this idea for years and always thought blockchain for voting makes so much sense. Election fraud or any fear of it would be gone forever. I mean imagine if journalists were able to catalogue reports/stories on the blockchain, fake news would be far less prevalent. Blockchain has so many uses outside of finance in my eyes.

Comment 2
Content: I like cardano but cmon. Are we really going to pretend that we're comparing apples to apples here. There's no way to know the comparison yet until the same amount of infrastructure and traffic is built on cardano. Don't get all excited when the only volume on cardano is from moving coins from exchanges to wallets.


Comment 3
Content: Holding feels good but staking feels great


Comment 4
Content: Who cares how much money was moved. How many transactions occurred?


Comment 5
Content: Dropped another 200 aud on ADA this morning. I try to avoid buying in large amounts all at once, but all this chatter about the update has me uncharacteristically amped.


Comment 6
Content: So good I dumped an eth for some more ada


Comment 7
Content: Just the beginning

Comment 9
Content: Everyone is focusing on the fees. But I’m actually surprised by the volume. Who is traversing assets in Cardano? For what usage?


Comment 10
Content: Nice, but just look at BCH. Still much room to get better.

Comment 2
Content: Positive thing. Community is the core of Cardano. Let’s push away any sort of speculation/rockets/moons/hype and let’s do more education for new joiners in order to let them understand the mission/vision behind those 3 letters: ADA.


Comment 3
Content: New member ✋excited to be here


Comment 4
Content: Welcome to all new members!Hopefully you don't only follow this subreddit but also do your due diligence and come to the conclusion this can be a life changing project.Not only for the holders of ADA, but even more for the people who gain excess to a lot of things once Cardano is completely running. I believe in the vision of the project team and have chosen to not only follow the project, but also backing it with buying ADA, staking ADA (with a smaller stake pool, so it helps the decentralization even more), telling people about it, sending videos about it to them, using ADA for buying things (travala by example) and sending some ADA to my friends and family, so they just can't ignore what's coming. And even if they don't do anything with it, the transactions are already helping the network.Use ADA where you can and don't forget to stake your ADA, so you also help yourself with an annual 5% extra ADA.For those who have 2950 ADA, make sure you put them on a Daedalus/Yoroi wallet and stake them and vote in Fund3 for the future of Cardano. It even gives you some rewards for your opinion. I think you can read, I'm a bit enthusiastic about ADA! Sorry, just can't help it, I really think the time for change has come and this is just the beginning!


Comment 5
Content: Does Gene Simmons have a fanbase that will enter into Cardano just because he did? I've been wondering since I saw the news this morning if we'll see a jump in interest due to him. If so, welcome fans of rock and leather!


Comment 6
Content: That’s obvious! It’s a great community!


Comment 7
Content: New member! Got myself into Crypto recently, bought ADA along with some others and I'm already staking on a (so far) tiny pool down in the 500's
