Comment 0: That is so fricking cool.
Comment 1: If Satoshi is still alive, I hope s/he gets a picture of themselves right in front of the statue!
Comment 2: That's actually a sick statue, I'm surprised.
Comment 3: Almost ironic given how famous Switzerland is for its Banks.  Guess they can walk and chew gum at the same time
Comment 4: The amount of hate this statue received on other subs is crazy
Comment 5: The amount of hate on r/pics is staggering. Man gave the world alternative financial system. It's a monumental achievement.
Comment 6: This captures the nature of Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin so well. You know the statue is there but it also becomes a transparent concept if you stand in front of it. The idea and the man and its opera are there for everyone to see, but it lives beyond its presence.
Comment 7: For anybody wondering if this is legit, it is. It's in Lugano, in the southern part of Switzerland and sponsored by Plan ‚Çø and Tether. Happened yesterday.

Comment 18: This is very well done. I very much enjoy this style of art.
Comment 19: Looks like a good job by whoever did it
Comment 20: Well, Switzerland's banking system which is their main source of ""earning"" and what Satoshi's Bitcoin stands for are inherently opposite to each other. Not sure, if this statue erection has any merit to it.
Comment 21: Creativity at finest¬†

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g5shz3/how_many_of_you_guys_actually_made_money_with/|How many of you guys actually made money with crypto?|"Post: Crypto is depicted as a relatively ‚Äúeasy‚Äù way to make money. Obviously that isn‚Äôt really the true. I find it more like a lottery than a easy income source if you trade with altcoins. So how many of you guys actually 2x, 5x, 10x or even 100x your money in crypto? And how many of you actually lost money so far? Do you consider crypto as a good way of making money if you do it smartly? Do you feel like crypto is easier to make money with than some other maybe more traditional methods? Do you feel like you can keep getting consistent results if you know what you‚Äôre doing?

Comment 0: Anybody who bought Bitcoin when it was red during bear market should be up. Likewise, anybody who just got into crypto during the bear market should be up.¬†


Most people that bought altcoins in 2021 and DCA'd during bear market thinking they would go up to their 2021 ATHs are down bad.¬†¬†


I'm in that 2nd group of degenerates.
Comment 1: started in 2012, retired in 2017 with that bull run, havnt had to work a day since and never will.
Comment 2: I'm living in a house which is fully paid off in my name, and it was purchased entirely with money made from crypto.
Comment 3: You‚Äôd have to sell to make $, so in that regard I technically haven‚Äôt made any money‚Ä¶. Yet
Comment 4: Maybe the real money are the friends we made along the way.
Comment 5: Nice try IRS
Comment 6: Years ago, I bought SHIBA, Made like 300k in 30 days. 

Everyone told me to HODL, I didn‚Äôt listen. Sold. 

I could‚Äôve made 600k if I held a little longer. Still happy I sold, if I would‚Äôve held I never would‚Äôve sold and lost it all.
Comment 7: I'm from a third world country so making money from crypto sounds easier than actually working considering the exchange rate. I've only discovered crypto last year and I've had the chance to earn some small amount (thanks to Banano essentially, full on potassium indeed!!). Even that small amount I received is almost close to three months of minimum wage in my country, just for talking so yes it's a good way depending on your own contexte I guess.

I've saved up like 2 years worth of salary and I hope to find at least x2 or x3 next year which can be life changing for me
Comment 8: Dogecoin paid off my house and gave me $50k to invest in the stock market.  I got out of crypto, I know how lucky I was.

My other win was I had it over a year (much over, I mined it) so my sell taxes were just 15%
Comment 9: I am up by 80% or so from my investment.  But I only invest in Ethereum and Bitcoin.  I don‚Äôt really chase the other altcoins or meme coins.  Only time I did was with Shiba Inu.
Comment 10: my avg price for btc bought is 23k. Time horizon matters alot, if you think that btc is gonna be 1mil+ a pop, every day is a good day to buy. üòÅ
Comment 11: Been invested since 2020 and have since made over 6 figures in gains in crypto. In the beginning it was mostly luck and timing. Was buying Doge at $0.006 when it was the laughing stock of the community. Cashed out at $0.06 and thought I had hit the lottery. Had I only held a few months longer, I could have turned $1500 into a $150,000 bag‚Ä¶.

Bought ETH at $1700, sold at $4800.
Got in and out of Shiba with about an 8X return.
Bought LRC in 2021 for $0.40, sold all of my bag for $2-3.
Bought SOL at $20, sold around $60.
Countless others that I made profits on as well (ADA, ETC, ICP, to name a few)

However my biggest Run to date has been from RARI (Rarible). I have been swing trading it since 2022, and at one point was up over $80k.

I pulled out all of my initial investment in 2021, so at this point everything has been pure profit for years. When my bags pump, I sell. When they dump, I buy. It‚Äôs really that simple‚Ä¶.

Most people get REKT in Crypto because they plan a ‚ÄúHODL‚Äù strategy. Which only works well if you plan to hold long term, and don‚Äôt look at your balance during Bear Markets.

Crypto is not only about knowing ***when*** to buy, but ***when*** to sell. This is the part people fuck up the most. They have their eyes set on a 10X but if it only peaks at 5X, and you don‚Äôt sell, then you just missed out on potential gains. Pick a Target, and sell when it hits that number. Be happy with your gains, and never look at ‚Äúmissed opportunities‚Äù because it will eat you alive in Crypto.

There has been many times over the past 2 years that I paid my mortgage with Crypto. Don‚Äôt let all of the FUD from people who got REKT fool you. There are a ton of people making good money here.
Comment 12: Been in the space since April 2021, lost on a lot of shitty decisions, but still up 15% overall.
Comment 13: I'll explain my history if anyone actually cares because I have made a LOT and don't consider myself a genius at all ... but also not particularly lucky. I'll give some real numbers too so hopefully this gives perspective for some people.

I spent most of 2016-2020 getting out of debt and repairing my credit. This is important because I became a lot more financially aware and literate. Without getting my life in order I would not have been able to make a lot in crypto.

By the end of 2020 Bitcoin reached a new ATH over $20k and I noticed it again (I became aware in 2017) and ended up speaking with 2 former college friends and 2 coworkers about Bitcoin and crypto. Without them fielding my questions and holding my hand I might not have gotten in, or at least not right away.

I could only afford about $100 a week and I decided I really needed to get both feet in. I looked at the past cycle and decided Ethereum had a good chance of jumping up to a new ATH soon since Bitcoin had just done so. I ended up buying some crypto here and there, but my first big move was putting a lien on my vehicle for $11k and putting that money into Bitcoin and Ethereum.

At that point ETH was $645.

By mid-January the whole market had gone up and I discovered crypto-backed loans. Now, there is a lot of risk with EVERYTHING I did, but the concept of collateralized loans of any kind is how the rich make money and reduce their taxes.

So I took loans out on my BTC and my ETH, and even at 50% it was over $20k by that point, so I paid off my lien and got back to owning my car again. By this point I was really looking at cryptocurrencies and really liked DeFi so I put a lot of the extra funds into other cryptos like Uniswap, Aave, Chainlink, The Graph ... and for anyone else that was there you realize how good my timing was for this. Because I knew they were going to explode upwards at some point, but I DID get lucky that it would be the next month in Feb 2021.

So most of those holdings went up 400-500% in the span of a few weeks. I took profits, doubled my BTC and ETH holdings, refinanced those loans into new, better loans, paid off the old loans and any debt, and then poured money into a ton of projects. I'd say I lost money on maybe 15% of those, and made minimal profits back on 40%. I never trusted FTX with their high liquidations, ads, and low fees. I liked Luna but I wasn't sure I grasped exactly how it was supposed to work and so I never bought it. I look at a lot of crypto as an angel investor and I would say I have a slight knack of talent from that perspective.

I walked right into the May 2021 crash, but restructured my portfolio over that summer, putting my profits BACK into the market, and then cashed out from October 2021 on. I lost probably $20k on margin calls from summer 2021 through summer 2022, but I made considerably more and held considerably more. At my highest net worth I was over 20x what I started with.

After the 2022 June crash I switched gears to stocking up on as big of a portfolio I could. Net worth was still several times higher than I was in Jan 2021, but it was hard. During the FTX crash everyone was saying you were stupid if you were buying and I ignored them: buying BTC at my lowest price of $15,800, SOL at $8.50, ETH at $1100 now, etc....

Continued buying through 2023 though this slowed down by Fall 2023, which was okay since Bitcoin is up nearly 150% from a year ago. The last 6 months has been draining with the sideways crabbing and how little fiat I can put into my portfolio now. But I am still up well over 100% ROI overall, and my net worth is at the best it has ever been.

I would say I should've avoided plenty of projects, at max I held 45 or so different coins. Currently I'm at 22, and even then I wish to hold less. Also, I should've bought more BTC and regret that. I don't think I'm gonna sell any BTC to 'take profits' but that profits will be used to buy me more BTC, regardless of price.

I wasn't completely lucky on knowing the potential of DeFi, but the timing was luck that the DeFi market exploded so much in Feb 2021 right after I put $1000s into those projects.

I also should have taken more profits. At one point I was sitting at over a quarter million and I was STILL greedy. I didn't have a proper profit-taking plan.

I am much more of a Bitcoin guy at this point. Bitcoin IS going up forever, most crypto will not, and many are scams or losers. I plan on having my portfolio be roughly 2/3s Bitcoin by 2026 as I keep moving away from risk-taking money gains to keeping the wealth I've accumulated.
Comment 14: Minting ordinals on Bitcoin have made me a lot of money , and some meme coins I bought before they pumped have done well for me. 
The src20 tokens that cost me a few hundred dollars to mint ended up being worth tens of thousands and the .bitmaps I minted had an ath of almost 400x, and I did really well on those. 
Buying during the bear market and farming airdrops has also made some good gains. 
You gotta put in the work and find communities that share alpha.
Comment 15: Early on during the 2020 rally i hit it big with a altcoin, i was extremely ignorant and didn't know much about it. I just heard it was easy money, jumped in with a 10x position on a random alt coin not knowing any better. I woke up next day and saw i 8x'd and immediately closed my position to where i was like wtf, i tried doing it again a few times with smaller positions and kept losing when i realized how lucky i got. That experience sparked a huge interest in me to learn the game, i'd sit behind my computer 8-12hrs a day looking at the market, going through strategies, studying the movements and what drives it. Now adays i am trading everyday but the weekends and i work with much much smaller positions and less leverage and i am in positions for a smaller amount of time. I now win more then i lose. But i dont do these single trade 5-10x's anymore, for me its not worth it, i'd rather take less risk and do 10 or 50 trades to 3x then do 1 big trade and pray it hits.
Comment 16: Those who have aren't here to talk about it, the only people left here are the ones who haven't made any money yet
Comment 17: [deleted]
Comment 18: Made money LOL I buy high and sell low sir
Comment 19: The ones who believe in crypto and buy when everyone else is ignoring it, like 2022-2024, make money and are up 200% right now or more. Those who buy into the hype, don't
Comment 20: Made it on Dogecoin. Bought in 2019 and sold right after SNL in 2021
Comment 21: Made money on paper last bullrun. But those gains were unrealized so I‚Äôm back to square one
Comment 22: I turned $67 into 280k into 3.2mil into $0.00 into 2k over the course of the last 13 years
Comment 23: iirc a study found that &gt;&gt;70% of retail investors lose money on crypto. This was, however, looking at data from some traditional exchange (i think etoro)
Comment 24: Mainly entered last cycle. So sadly no great returns, yet. Still have to wait.

But! It greatly shifted my perpective on how I spent money. And seeing money I didn't spend on stuff I do not need is a win for me. It's money I ""made"", money I was able to keep.
Comment 25: Started end of 2021, lost some money. Stayed in, now green and still waiting for a bull. If I cashed out now, I'd have more (including inflation) than I started with. So it is possible. Tip one: leave the shitcoins to someone else. Tip two: collect Reddit tokens for free. Tip three: see tip one.
Comment 26: I work in crypto industry so in some sense yes I make money from crypto. 10x my net worth in the last 3 years.
Comment 27: [removed]
Comment 28: I mined ETH early. It's staked and growing. I bought/sold some houseboats. Lucky enough to pay for my current car in cash (someone totaled my trusty little car, and I just had liability), move after divorce and get set up.

The ETH still grows, but I did take about 10% and invest in SOL last month, otherwise I never sold or reinvested it.
Comment 29: I was an affiliate for Viagra and got paid my commission in 1 Bitcoin when Bitcoin was around $800.  

I still have the Bitcoin. I couldn't figure out how to sell the damn thing. Lol

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gch70i/this_is_the_bullrun_and_your_favorite_projects/|This is the bullrun and your favorite projects are cooked|"Post: The s&amp;p500 is breaking ATHs, BTC hit a new ath this year and is consolidating right bellow waiting to make its move passed it again.

You're all in denial about alt season repeating like in former cycles. I see it everyday with people buying up shitcoins and everyone in those ""communities"" claiming they're all going to go 4x their previous ATH ""once the bullbrun starts.""

News flash. This is the bullrun. Previously, people would take BTC profits and pump up larger cap alts, take those profits and go to small caps and finally micro caps. More people are holding onto their BTC. Look at the charts, theres far fewer flash crashes. All metrics suggest this including BTC in cold storage and more inactive wallets than ever. This BTC progression in previous cycles saw the alt coin market going nuts. At this point, You could do a 4x on any random binance pair. The fomo was crazy. There's none of that now. Just bleeding alts to BTC.

Furthermore, people are skipping out on the larger cap speculation for the meme coin defi market. Raydium is seeing all the volume that traditionally went to CEX listed alts.

""But meme coins are stupid and serve no purpose, I only buy ""serious"" projects.

News flash. The alt coin you've been holding for 5 years is just as useless as ElonBadgerCoq on trader Joe's. It's done nothing. The team has accomplished nothing. You know this and still try to justify your investment so you can separate yourself from the degen gamblers buying cat tokens on some DEX. I don't care how many transactions it can do or the speed of finality or what company is rumored to have plans to use it. Its the same meme coin hype shit, just a smaller scale.

Yes, some projects will pump in the next year. Yes, some projects are genuinely good with great developers making amazing tech. But most of the alts you're buying and holding with the expectation of past price action will not return to ATHs. Price aside, whatever goals on your teams roadmap mean fuck all. There's not that many problems a speculative token fueled blockchain can fix that some traditional network can't do better, faster and cheaper. No major publicly sold company cares about how decentralized something is.

Downvote me all you want. I know you really care about whatever ETH killer youve been stacking and holding. Some of you will get lucky and I hope you do. But for most, its not happening.

The reason why meme coins are so popular is because it's the streamlined, super fast paced version of the entire crypto market. It's the final format. A launch, a bunch of hype, the coin bleeds out, some people make some money, most lose. The coin drops close to 0 with all the bag holders claiming it will return to where it was. Rinse lather and repeat.

Comment 0: As someone who was here in 2017 and 2021, this feels absolutely nothing like the bull run. We're just getting started. Bitcoin is currently below it's 2021 ATH. Think about how much has happened in this space since then.
Comment 1: The Analysis flair is doing a lot of heavy lifting.

And while I don't completely disagree that many altcoins will underperformed BTC (this has occurred in the past too - I believe XRP, Litecoin both underperformed against BTC in 2020-2021), there will also be many that outperform.
Comment 2: This post will age like milk. Mark my words
Comment 3: Btc stronger than ever so can hold 60-70k but altmarket nukes. Bull for alts is where btc breaks 70k. We are in the verge of it. 

Bears always making it complicated
Comment 4: This guy has complete confidence in his bullshit opinion
Comment 5: You do realise that the last two cycles it took around 220-230 days for btc to make a ATH with inflation included after the halving? Thats mid-late November 2024. Not even started. You talk about history but don‚Äôt even check timelines of previous runs? Lmao
Comment 6: Ah the FUD posts are here. Exactly before the parabolic bullrun starts. Crypto will melt faces and OP will feel ridiculous looking back 4 years from now.
Comment 7: Maybe - maybe not. Let the simulation play out. I'm zooming out and looking forward to living long enough to see at least 60 years of data.
Comment 8: I just want to breakeven mfers and get out of this shit hole. Alts have no bottom, they all stinking hard against Bitcoin for 3 years
Comment 9: Noted. Just sold all my BTC.
Comment 10: I dont know man, I did a 20x on SOL.
Comment 11: Noted... This is the bull run post means this is NOT the bullrun.

Wait for the 'I'm selling my house and going all in'. 'Left my job for full time web3'

Then we know we are in the bull run.
Comment 12: alt season isn't like the regular cycle, you don't get these 30-40% is 3 weeks kind of moves, it's more like 1000% in 3 days then on to the next 10x

eth classic ripped like a 3-4x 3 times before it was done

the longer we have to wait, the bigger the pop will be

that's why we who've been around say

only the **pump** is real
Comment 13: Agree with the analysis and appreciate the excellent grammar.

I plan to soon convert all my silly small holdings of alts to BTC. Eth included most likely.
Comment 14: All crypto is useless, all the money has been made, I made bank in 2016 and again today in 2020, ship has sailed, time for a new ponzi, get in early brotha!
Comment 15: Yo all I know is that with my 6yo daughters recommendation I bought popcat at 60 cents, you just have to have the right advisor for this market
Comment 16: I've heard about bullrun so much that I'm still waiting for it with grey hair üò©
Comment 17: But my coin is different‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the future
Comment 18: You have zero clue what you are talking about 

EVERY chart is screaming at us that a true bullrun is coming in 2025. Q1/Q2/Q3 2025 is going to be nuts. Position yourself now people if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be reading this
Comment 19: I hope the bull run has legs before recession kicks in.
Comment 20: Get a load of this guy
Comment 21: Remindme! 1 year
Comment 22: The key difference is there are almost no ICO's this cycle, so there are few new coins to pump, besides rando meme coins that are cheap to spin up. Old coins don't really pump, they just go closer and closer to $0. All projects are dead, the only thing they ever had was hype, but they can't afford to buy fake volume to pump them a second time, because all the ICO money is gone, or sitting in their Bitcoin wallets, never to move back to projects.
Comment 23: Btc hasn‚Äôt tipped all time highs when adjusted for inflation. Talk to me once we hit 88k.
Comment 24: So should I buy or sell
Comment 25: Meme coin super cycle. People are too stubborn
Comment 26: Why do you guys insist that there is an ETH killer out there? All these projects and ETH will likely coexist for the foreseeable future
Comment 27: Narrator: it was in fact, not the bullrun
Comment 28: I largely agree but with a different take.

Look at the founders and teams of those altcoins of bull runs past. They've already made their fortunes, and are just playing with the house money now, revealing in their own accomplishments.

The teams and owners just lose the incentive to get rich ""again"" on the same coin. They're living the life are persuing other means of maximising their gains.
Comment 29: The OP didn't mention the competitive landscape. Sure, there are lots of great projects and great tech that have been around a while. But there is a lot more competition from newer, more efficient projects. And ""better tech"" doesn't necessarily win. We old folks remember Betamax was superior to VHS, and look how that turned out.  

I've been saying for months that a LOT of the big-name alts from previous cycles are going to disappoint this time around. I won't name them because this sub is so tribal. A few of them might 2x from here. 3x at best. But most will wither and become zombie chains. 

This cycle is VERY different.
Comment 30: I've been in crypto since 2016 and agree. I've made money on Link, LTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, Aave, etc. These more reputable projects where doing well in the past.

However now, most people are DCAing on Bitcoin or Ethereum while reducing their position on alts, especially since ETFs. I initially got into crypto for quick gains, but this past year started to offload for less volatile options, first time I have done this since 2016. All my alts have been underperforming compared to the pre 2020s, even the projects I believe in heavily. The only alts that are getting trajection in the past years are garbage like NFTs or meme coins on SOL or DOGE being pumped by Elon, which is not good news for long-term health of crypto. Even for BTC to grow 2x at this point would take a massive market cap increase, so people who want quick gains from crypto will slowly turn elsewhere.
Comment 31: As long as your coin is on a big exchange, you dont need to worry when the bullrun comes.
Comment 32: Most shitcoins that were popular last run have never recovered. I'll never touch a shitcoin ever again (learned from 2018)
Comment 33: !Remind me 1 year
Comment 34: Next you‚Äôll be telling us the Easter Bunny doesn‚Äôt exist, you f@*king killjoy.
Comment 35: My MARA has been absolute garbage that's for sure
Comment 36: So true
Comment 37: I‚Äôm balls deep in hege with no other play. So I‚Äôm going to suck it up and pretend I never read this . Thank you
Comment 38: !remind me 3 months
Comment 39: This has to be the biggest load of crap I‚Äôve ever read
Comment 40: Hahahaha. I just said the same exact thing.
Comment 41: TLDR, that is all.  Thanks
Comment 42: ETFs have brought big money, but also big money profit taking.
Retail wants x10, institutions are overjoyed with x2
Comment 43: ‚ÄúThe s&amp;p500 is breaking ATHs‚Äù like it has every year since existence üòÇ
Comment 44: you don‚Äôt know anything about our community. It‚Äôs literally a crow with a knife!
Comment 45: That's fair. I never thought if it like that before
Comment 46: The highest BTC goes is 90k - 99k. 6 / 6.5 x from lows. 

BTC is entering maturity. 10x bull runs are done. Lottery wins are over (majority speaking). Time to actually deliver something that streamlines the world from shitcoins. Won‚Äôt happen, crypto is now a complete joke, both in terms of projects, culture and personalities. The days of genuine BTC and crypto enthusiasm have been replaced with degenerate bingo players. 

Back to the tech of what crypto offers. it‚Äôs pretty fucking sick.
Comment 47: I hear people talk about a bullrun, the excitement builds, the part of my brain that houses my imagination sparks into life.

Fantasy, fulfilment... piles of blow and hookers as far as my cociane riddled eyes can see.

My palms begin to get sweaty. Finally, I can leave this daily grind behind and become a God of hedonistic pursuits.

I rush to coinbase, finance or ledger and behold...

Polkadot ¬£3.82 a coin. VeChain pfffft, Cardano rofl. Stacks, meh.

Even my beloved Prince Eth has barely changed, and the big daddy mac bitcoin is doing what it has always done.

A let out a disappointed sigh, I shut the door on the drug fueled sex orgies and go back to the grind

Damn you, reddit, damn you
Comment 48: Bitcoin. There is no second best. Everything else is a lottery ticket.
Comment 49: 
Comment 50: Alt-coin cults remind me of stock cults. The similarities are striking.

This video does a great job describe how the cults work and how the funnel the money of their unsuspecting victims into the hands of the founders/VC's. 

The Cult of the Dead Stock.

Comment 51: 
Comment 52: Newbies lecturing others all over again. It's started guys. If you've had some experience, you would know that alt season starts after btc tops. That hasn't happened even remotely yet.
Comment 53: This. Only bagholders caste about their shitcoin bags. There is no second best.
Comment 54: Every cycle there are shitcoins that will never hit their all time high again. A bunch of people discovering that they held onto shit for too long. Luckily, I didn't sell at all time highs, but I did dump pretty much everything into only BTC &amp; ETH.
Comment 55: Ahh, the famous *'your projects won't make money'* post.  There were posts like this in the past.  This time is no different.  There are people who cry, and people like me who buy.  Let's see where we are a year from now.
Comment 56: Sir, this sub is for teenagers to larp as angry elder millennials and monitor every move Elon makes
Comment 57: Don't need Ethereum killer if Ethereum kill themselves
Comment 58: If algo isn't top 5 by 2030 il maybe consider what you said
Comment 59: I‚Äôll take top 50, my bag is killing me
Comment 60: There are so many flaws in the logic of this post. One salient example, no one cares about decentralization. This alone negates the essence of bitcon itself. Ergo bitcon is also shit coin
Comment 61: this is the signal that alt season is about to start
Comment 62: I‚Äôm really glad my favorite project is BTC, and my second fav are these ai memecoins that are exploding.¬†
Comment 63: Amen.
Comment 64: Brave post, I'll give yout that
Comment 65: RemindMe!¬†6 months
Comment 66: 
Comment 67: Market is different now. Look at eth.¬†
Comment 68: Leaving out BTC and ETH, only 

Dogecoin will break ATH again.

All the other old Altcoins likely won't.

This is what happened in the last Bullrun.
Comment 69: This bullrun only a handful will make it, most will die out. Some of the my fav are dead, Ergo, HNT, Flux etc etc.
Comment 70: As long as alts act like the casino, people will still buy them lol. Maxi's always have their ""this time it's different"" narratives which is actually part of the cycle.
Comment 71: Alt season last cycle started in december/january, take a seat boy
Comment 72: !remind me 2 months
Comment 73: [removed]
Comment 74: 
Comment 75: Lulz. 

OP just ran outta patience.
Comment 76: While during this cycle BTC is indeed outperforming alts on average, its current price is comparable to ~20k in the previous cycle; and that was only the beginning for the majority of alt coins. However, macro is different and the development might be so as well.
Comment 77: [removed]
Comment 78: 
Comment 79: it starts in november every single time it wouldnt take much inteligence or effort to open a chart from 2020-2021
Comment 80: Oh good, people are getting negative. That means it will start soon.
Comment 81: [removed]
Comment 82: 
Comment 83: Aww yes. Finally someone who knows shit about fuck.
Comment 84: !Remind me 1 year
Comment 85: Honestly who tf still buys LTC, XRP, ADA, etc? Bunch of trash, I remember when I was a big into LTC, thank fuckin god I dumped my bags and converted to bitcoin
Comment 86: The majority of this sub is under 20 years old. They don‚Äôt want to buy fractions of bitcoin so they buy wholes of shitcoins.
Comment 87: [removed]
Comment 88: 
Comment 89: OP creates a copium post. We hold boys. Stead fast
Comment 90: [removed]
Comment 91: 
Comment 92: Damn it's been what 10 years and yall still on about teams, fundamentals and technology?
Comment 93: The feeling of ‚Äúoh shit I missed out on X, let me get in early on the next thing‚Äù doesn‚Äôt change. Alt season is a cascade of this fuelled by human greed and whatever the biggest narrative is, I don‚Äôt think that is going to change much. Not sure if it will happen in this market, but it‚Äôs for sure happening again imo.
Comment 94: So I bought BTC and these crap coins in August because that's when I was financially able to. That being said my crap coins are up way more rn ie Solana turbo and mintlayer
Comment 95: Remindme! 6 months
Comment 96: The whole month of September you guys were going on and on about ‚Äúuptober‚Äù. Did you guys have any solid numbers you were looking at? Or was it just some kind of vain manifestation? Obviously nothing happened and I personally never expected it too. Macros don‚Äôt indicate any sort of climbing action. Big institutions are still seeing major outflows and selling action and there was no indication of that reversing.

The meme coin rush we had this summer was the bull run. If you missed that; sucks to suck.
Comment 97: Ethereum proof of stake... Bitcoin ETF... SEC loses their lawsuit against Ripple.... Both presidential candidates supporting the industry.. bull run is yet to come baby

Hoard on projects like buk protocol fr, as early as possible with their chainwarz
Comment 98: This post just encouraged me to buy more Alts
Comment 99: Been in crypto for 10 years.  When people have these long monologues about a new paradigm you take it as a signal.
Comment 100: My shitcoin position is up 25x. I don‚Äôt feel super cooked
Comment 101: Alt coins always move after the first big bitcoin leg up past previous ATH. Look at 2021. Bitcoin dominance climbed through end of 2020 into January, and by then Bitcoin had already doubled the previous ATH. In Feb the dominance dropped and alt season took off. This is still early bull/accumulation, not the red hot bull market everyone anticipates. This is the correct time to start accumulating alts if you want to take a gamble. Although the PERFECT play is staying in bitcoin until about 150-200k USD, then jumping into alts as bitcoin momentum stalls.¬†


I'm not bothering reading past the first couple paragraphs because you've already lost credibility.
Comment 102: Crabbing for 6 months is a bull run now guys üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment 103: Oh we are so so so back folks. Alt coin FUD and calls that this is the top of the bull run. We‚Äôre back baby.
Comment 104: [removed]

Comment 106: The year after the halving had been where the biggest gains have come with both btc and alts‚Ä¶

Comment 110: 
Comment 111: You always get posts like this at this point in the cycle. It‚Äôs hilarious. We‚Äôre exactly where we should be, and if you‚Äôre feeling op, maybe this space isn‚Äôt for you, go and join the buttcoin sub
Comment 112: The only ‚Äúreal‚Äù bull run will be BTC. Sell your shitcoins, move it to BTC, then you‚Äôll not see just a normal bull run but instead will be a run of the bulls. Then move back to the shitcoins if you want. You‚Äôll have made enough money.
Comment 113: When wen?
Comment 114: ""Analysis"" flair lmao
Comment 115: Nice try OP, I'm still gonna buy me CUMMIESVSELONVSDOGEVSSHIBACOIN
Comment 116: People shouldnt expect last cycle big movers to do the same this cycle. You have to find new low caps with potential. Trust me this has been the case since 2011. Tectum is one of my big bets this cycle. Last cycle ot was Quant and Fantom but I wouldnt touch them now. Respecting cycles is key to making money.
Comment 117: lol nice try, not selling my $ASS coin until it hits $1
Comment 118: I love laughing at Ravencoin and NEO evangelists still posting in their subreddit asking if now is a good time to accumulate more. 

Poor bastards, it‚Äôs time to move on
Comment 119: Who made you to announce ‚Äúnewsflash‚Äù. That‚Äôs all i need to know
Comment 120: The words ""news flash"" is like the boomer version of ""trust me bro"". You lost me after that sentence
Comment 121: [removed]
Comment 122: 
Comment 123: What bull run? BTC is still down and hasn't moved like any other asset has over the past few years.
Comment 124: ‚ÄúThis time it‚Äôll be different‚Äù - these guys every bull run.
Comment 125: Dummies still bag holding dino coins . Games always been about attention. All about memes now .
Comment 126: 2025 will be different, in a good way
Comment 127: Lol I agree with everyone here - OP is obviously new to crypto and has no idea about the markets.¬†
Comment 128: Altcoin season last few weeks in the end of bitcoin cycle this is nothing new although this constant drops in altcoins are worrying they should be slowly going up building momentum
Comment 129: We're not in the bullrun yet, not the big one at least, not even close.
Comment 130: Bull runs are never the same. I been here since 2013 .  Don‚Äôt waste time on alts this is a BTC show this time
Comment 131: Thank God you have spoken, my investment is saved

Comment 1: nano\_1mik9ozqyrmzgck96gq7dfntjsb9w8ajc7j78rkofbaowo8kf3nz1upfcgpn

Been with you guys since the Raiblocks days. Could never figure out how such a fast and feeless crypto never got more traction. Hopefully things like this help build awareness.
Comment 2: Wow super! Stoked to see it grow

nano_3gkqrmwj8hzm53cmsgdjgqiq1ti41hq9nyb49j6gpsgw5d1reiebd3toh3ny
Comment 11: I never heard of nano.  Interesting, much more common sense sounding than, ‚ÄúGrandma, did you consider the gas fees, priority and bribery fees, the platform fees and did you forget to claim back your rent?‚Äù

nano_38qotnore1awh7sxf4c7hw5t4xtjkcdbiqi4ff6zbnerwonkrr1nrog5uk59
Comment 12: I‚Äôve just read up about it and I genuinely think that this is such great movement with real morals behind it. Nowadays so many cryptocurrencies are created to mimic the success of bitcoin and not with a real vision in mind. I really hope you guys achieve what you‚Äôre hoping for here
Comment 13: I figure why not?

I still use it to safe on transaction fees, I'm grateful its still being maintained after so many years, thanks!

nano_1ijrfnsh96a1armdrix57odwxpowggg5yftazye5mog7y4uhs1bnw5hir3mu
Comment 18: This seems like it could be very useful when transferring between countries or making it easier for businesses in impoverished places to transact in the western online market. The biggest beneficial use case for crypto by far is lifting many of these people out of poverty even if not making them rich in their own countries though many times that can be the case depending. If anyone runs a business outside the west using crypto as a payment option I would love more insight on how this works out for you. Nothing compares to primary sources after all
Comment 19: Still decentralised, still extremely fast, still no fees at all, still very energy efficient. I‚Äôll have some more pls

Seems to be hard to get the extra 550 nano, a lot of people downvoting the post for some reason.

Comment 26: Hi! I'm a survivor of Bitgrail from the XRB days. I even set the world record for price (at least in the western hemisphere, there was a weird eastern exchange $100 order afterward that beat it) with the purchase of five (5) units at $37 each. Mercatox was the only other exchange at the time. I guess I should have been providing supply to the market. But I still envision a future where Nano is commonly used for the purchase of goods and services!

nano_3fn5sa69m9f33dmh3p8ihhk6enazbh5mm3bgn8i17d9sh8pikeux5hprepxs
Comment 31: Nano (XNO) is the best currency imho.
Like any scientific base unit, it is fixed, well defined, durable and verifiable: a perfect denominator (unit of account).

As any open &amp; popular protocol, it doesn‚Äôt have fees in the protocol (but you are free to charge for services on top, like ISP do on TCP/IP).

As a convenient medium of exchange it has instant transfers (sub-second finality) all over the word and permissionless, non-kyc, free to use non-custodial accounts. 

Like all permissionless blockchain networks, it wants to be decentralized, but ensures that even long-term with game theory, by completely removing inflationary rewards, any intrinsic incentive or potential for scale economies and concentration of power (learn about ORV consensus).

Keep up the good work and spread the love! The market will realize the goodness someday. üí™üèªüíô

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g9rz8a/i_found_my_recovery_phrase/|I found my recovery phrase!!!|"Post: I made a post three months ago, which you can still see on my history, about misplacing my recovery phrase &amp; resetting my cold wallet. I turned the whole apartment upside down to find it, but had no luck. After burrowing beyond the sea of scam DMs I received, the well-meaning commenters more or less made clear that my crypto was gone unless I could find my recovery phrase. I really struggled after losing it, and actually ended up in the hospital the next day.

I‚Äôm in the process of moving, and tried to save myself some money on cleaning fees by doing a big deep clean myself (mandatory as part of my rental agreement). Lo and behold, I found the phrase in between the sheets of an old textbook. I have absolutely no idea how it ended up there (I never took it out of the case I stored it in), but it doesn‚Äôt matter! I found it! I‚Äôve just restored my wallet &amp; everything‚Äôs there!!!

I would like to ensure that my dumb ass never ends up in this position again. To those who are wiser and/or more experienced, can you please advise as to the best way of storing/securing my recovery phrases for maximum security? I‚Äôm not particularly keen on a password manager or any digital storage.

Thanks in advance. I‚Äôm off for a beer!

If you truly know for a fact you didn't put it there, then someone.else has seen it (and moved it) and if it was me, I'd be sending it to another wallet with a new phrase.
Comment 6: You son of a b*tch ...you did it. Maybe with your help that guy digging in the landfill for his Bitcoin has a chance.
Comment 7: Mem mo rize.


There is no substitute. Writing them down is just temporary to help you memorize.


Use mnemonics as designed, and you can never lose it.

Comment 20: (1) Make 3 copies of your seed into steel plates.

(2) Distribute steel plates in various locations that only your family should know about.

(3) Add a passphrase to the seed to generate a new wallet.

(4) Move 95 to 98% of funds to this new passphrase wallet.

(5) If someone ever tries to rob you, take the funds from the basic wallet w/out passphrase.. let them have those decoy funds.

(6) You still have other seed plates and should have used a passphrase that you memorized.

(7) In the event that your pass, use a dead man's switch to send the location of a treasure map to your heirs.

(8) They must work to get the passphrase, combining it with 1 of the seed plates, in order to unlock the REAL wallet.

(9) Profit??

Comment 27: Had you not posted this, you could have claimed it was lost and pointed to your previous post as evidence.

Then claim it's some anonymous person spending your coins who must have just found your seed phrase. Run it through a mixer and boom, non-KYC stack.

Not financial or legal advice.
Comment 28: Great news!
Comment 29: What was it?
Comment 30: The ultimate way to HODL.
Comment 31: Id get a new recovery phrase in case you *aren't* how that sheet ended up in the notebook. Its maybe unlikely, but quite possible someone with access to you copied it down for later and put it back in a different place. (They could be waiting to see if the balance grows before stealing it). A little paranoid? Sure. Better safe than sorry.
Comment 32: So ... What is it?
Comment 33: The simplest thing is to get a safe deposit box and keep a copy there, sealed in an envelope, stored inside a closed plastic Ziploc bag.

It is hard for anyone to get to it, but you will always know where it is. And if you are hit by a bus, your family will be able to recover it.

There are more sophisticated ways to do it, but this one will protect you in most situations, and your mnemonic is unlikely to be stolen.
Comment 34: Doesn‚Äôt anyone else create a story out of their seed phrase? 

The words are all nouns, just add some verbs/pronouns/prepositions - eg:

I drove my CAR to the DIAMOND PATH which allowed me to eat STEAK‚Ä¶ etc etc 

Just use the key phrase words as the direct nouns of your story. Or am I the only one who paid attention in English class?

Edit to add: congrats, btw!
Comment 35: fireproof safe and steel plates with the seed etched is a decent start.  there are waterproof pen/paper as well that you could throw into the fireproof storage or stick to the scratch plates.
Comment 36: well dont leave us hanging....what is it?
Comment 37: what's in the box?!
Comment 38: In my experience, diversification is the name of the game.  


Assuming we're talking about non-trivial amounts of money:

Don't keep all of your funds in one wallet.  
Not just multiple wallets per seed phrase, but multiple seed phrases.  
Have a hardware wallet? Load the seed phrase in a second wallet and keep it somewhere else.  
Do that for any distinct seed phrase.

Comment 42: What did we learn today? Cleaning your place pays off.
Comment 43: You should get a safe and store the phrase in there. As a backup plan, you could memorize it
Comment 44: What and how much did you think you'd have lost? Glad you found it!
Comment 45: Split it into two parts; make some obfuscation of the data in case of compromise and store multiple copies in multiple trusted places. Have a passphrase which you only store or retain.
Comment 46: When I was putting back my seed it slipped out and fell on my bed. Todo invest in an envelope....
Comment 47: Awhile back I saw an ad on Instagram for a company that was making laser engraved metal cards with recovery phrases on them.  It literally never dawned on me until I started typing this that they would have your recovery phrase ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Comment 48: Leave a copy with me as a digital backup, I'll keep it safe for you? I also need your SSN, your mother's maiden name, the name of your first childhood pet, your driver's license number, and a certified copy of your birth certificate.
Comment 49: congrats

how much did u have in the wallet
Comment 50: So when are we celebrating? Ill buy the water!
Comment 51: I also recently lost mine, can you take a picture and show me yours? Need a picture reference to find something similar. Of course let it be a raw picture and showing all 12 or 24 words in the correct order.
Comment 52: memorize those words,you can do it.
Comment 53: Just a beer? Damn, you‚Äôve got to celebrate with a yacht party and bikini girls!
Comment 54: 2 or 3 fire proof pouches. One for you. 1 for a safety deposit box, one for a parent or a trusted family member that doesn't know what a bunch of random words mean.
Comment 55: Quick! Send it to me so you don‚Äôt lose it again!
Comment 56: Buy a set of fireproof metal plates designed for crypto key storage and a set for stamping letters onto metal. Maybe it‚Äôs overboard but it certainly works.
Comment 57: I have a safe box at home and store it there. Only me and the wifey have a key to it. And I taught her how to sell crypto on the exchanges in case anything happens to me.
Comment 58: I bought several of those metal plates to engrave the seed phrases in, and keep them in the safe. It can withstand a fire, wich i unfortunatly experienced half a year ago. I thank god every day i didnt just wrote it on a piece of paper because it would have been all gone.

Comment 63: I wouldn't put that data in anything that connects to the internet, just to be safe. Get a hardware wallet with a PIN, set it to something you'll remember and keep 2 copies of your recovery phrase in 2 different places, like books or whatever, and remember where they are. Congrats btw
Comment 64: Still hunting mine for my alt account
Comment 65: 'I'm off for a beer'

There you go, you misplaced it when you were drunk.
Comment 66: Here comes the down votes for simply mentioning anything most people haven't heard of before... 

  
But this is the perfect case for a Frogwallet. Check the website obvious sealed paper wallet with a fireproof document holder that could fit in any drawer, safe or whatever. Waterproof, fireproof and sealed. If you don't know you should at least take a look. Big enough not to lose, but small enough not to be obvious to others. 

Good luck and congrats on finding that seed.. whew!
Comment 67: The words are unique at four letters. So you can stamp just the first four letters of each word into a piece of metal. And stick the metal in a fireproof box. (Edit: Oops, everyone already mentioned that.)

As an aside, I write novel outlines as a hobby, and one of my novels is about a high school kid who studies some of the FBI's most prolific cases. When he goes to the library to check out a book about the Unabomber, he finds a Post-it note inside with 24 words written on it. The words unlock his access to a global criminal underworld. He gets into a fight for his life as the participants try to take him out before he can expose them.

It's so awesome that's where you found your words.
Comment 68: &gt;can you please advise as to the best way of storing/securing my recovery phrases for maximum security?

i have a drawer next to my desk with my important stuff in it. thats where it is and it'll never leave that spot. keep your house organized so you dont lose stuff would be my best advice lol
Comment 69: Yeah I wish I could get as lucky! I have 400 BTC lost in space. No clue where my seed phrase is, because I bought back late 2010-earliy 11. Moved 4 tumes since then. I've just chaulked up the loss
Comment 70: Use a self hosted password manager like keepassxc and make the master password very long and difficult. You can also punch the seed into a stainless steel plate and store that in a secure location separate from the hardware wallet. I'd recommend erasing the hardware wallet and just keep the seed safe.
Comment 71: Wow. Need more good news like this. :-)
Comment 72: ive lost two wallets both with thousand quid In bitcoin. disappointing. but im happy you found yours
Comment 73: How did you end up in the hospital the day after if you don‚Äôt mind me asking, are you doing alright? lol I went like 30 comments down and didn‚Äôt see anyone else ask
Comment 74: Get a letter/number punch kit and a set of stainless steel washers.  Punch the first 4 letters (or the entire word if you want) of each word in your seed phrase.  Also, stamp the number of the order of words it's in.  Once you've stamped the washers, get a nut and bolt and put the washers on the bolt and screw the nut over the top.  Now you have a permanent, fireproof backup of your seed phrase.  You could throw it in a tool box and it would just look like something that belonged there, a stack of washers.
Comment 75: First, get a hardware wallet. Then, either get a titanium plate or the cheaper way, stainless steel washers, and a bolt to hold them together. You will need either an electric scribe or a letter punch kit. I bought the punch kit because my handwriting sucks. Make two copies. One hidden in your home and one stored elsewhere safe from natural forces. 
I picked a spot near a utility like a power line or train track or pipeline or bridge that is unlikely to change anytime soon. If you live in snow country, burying it might not be a good idea if you might need access in the winter.
Store your hardware wallet and seed phrase separately. 
I dipped my washer stack in hot green candle wax and rolled it in dirt, thinking it would camouflage it. It didn't really work. It's better to just spray paint the stack green or brown.
If you have a truly trusted friend or relative, they can keep a copy, but that is risky.
Also, use a passphrase so that if anyone finds your stack, it won't do them any good.
Comment 76: I know its much hated but Ledger Recover service works well. If it makes you sleep peacefully it might be worth considering
Comment 77: Congratulations! My advice to prevent such situations:

Trezor hardware wallet with multi-share backup, also known as SLIP39 standard.

It allows you to create for example a 2-of-5 scheme, where you store 5 shares (word lists) to 5 different locations and you need any 2 of them to recover. You can set how many shares you generate (e.g. 5) and what's the threshold to recover (e.g. 2). Popular options are 2-of-3, 3-of-5, etc. 

It's great because if you lose one share, no biggie. On the other hand, if someone discovers (or steals) one of your shares, they cannot get access to your wallet.
Comment 78: Newsflash....it doesn't matter how deep you clean that apartment. The landlord is gonna screw you on your deposit.
Comment 79: I used this and stamped them into a teflon cookie sheet. Then I put the metal cookie sheet in my fireproof gun safe.

Comment 80: This is such a great ending.  Congrats man!!
Comment 81: I keep a notebook with important information. A composition book works nicely. Of course put that in a safe place.. For added protection you can add an extra word that only you know to either the beginning or the end. Personally I have three extra words added to mine. I've also given my passphrase to someone that I know and trust. I recommend saving it in more than one place. BTW congratulations on finding your passphrase! üéäüéâüéäüç∏üç∏üç∏Cheers
Comment 82: Well, keeping it in an old text book is really not a bad idea as long as you know that it's there and no one else does.
Comment 83: Multiple copies in multiple places. Family you trust. Even if it's a friend's house - just hide with other words that only you know are bogus.I see so many validators in Ethereum slowly losing their ETH and it's clear they didn't have a plan.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1fwztvv/spent_1600_and_2_months_doing_copytrading_these/|Spent $1600 and 2 months doing CopyTrading, these are the results:|"Post: Hey everyone!

So a couple months ago I had some money laying around and I decided I wanted to try new things to see if I could earn some extra bucks. As background, I knew I could risk this money since I have a good joob and I didn't need it to survive, and I like crypto (bad combination some would say).

That's when I remembered Binance has this feature where you can copy trade people and share the profits. So I bought some USDT and sent it to my Binance account to get started.

# Initial Strategy

I have some experience with trading, but nothing too crazy. And I'm very familiar with the crypto world, I joined in 2019. But despite that, I never tried copy trading in general, let alone using Binance platform, so I wasn't really sure of what strategy to follow.

After some thought, I decided I didn't want to put all the eggs in a single basket, and decided I wanted to ""test"" the traders before giving them more money. Especially because I was going to use futures instead of spot trading.

I started testing the traders with an initial balance of 50 USDT, and I'd increase it on a monthly basis depending on their results.

I didn't know what to expect, so I chose the traders mainly on PnL/ROI, but that was pretty much it.

# First revisions

As you may expect already, choosing traders based on PnL/ROI was kind of a mistake. Some of the traders were super aggressive and used high amounts of leverage (one of them was using x125 lol), meaning that they were getting crazy returns when they won, but also losing pretty much everything when they lost.

After the first month I realized this and started searching for traders that matched a specific criteria, traders must have the following:

* Decent amount of days in the platform (+100 ideally)
* Low amount of previosuly closed wallets (less than 3 ideally)
* Decent returns but not crazy in the last 90 days (10/-50% range)
* Steady PnL/ROI chart upwards
* Low MDD (around 20% max)
* Decent sharpe ratio

As you can see, I became more selective with the traders that I choose (and I will probably continue adjusting this based on the results), and I stopped expecting quick crazy returns.

# Results

In total I copied 20 different traders and as a way to share the results, I created a spreadsheet where you can better visualize the results that I got divided by each trader:

[https://i.imgur.com/DwyokbQ.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/DwyokbQ.jpeg)

*NOTE: PnL for traders currently open include PnL for open positions, and does not include profit sharing (usually 10%).*

As you can see, most of the traders that I started copying during first month are now closed. Main reason is that I didn't like their strategy/risk management and I didn't feel comfortable copying them, or they directly lost everything.

Luckily, second batch of traders I chose using the adjusted strategy seem to be doing good. But it's still early to jump into conclusions since I started copying them less than a month ago. I wait at least a month before deciding to give them more capital as I mentioned before.

# Final Numbers

In order to better visualize the results, I created this simple summary:

[https://i.imgur.com/MxtGKBq.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/MxtGKBq.jpeg)

As you can see, despite all the loses, I still managed to earn 129USDT, close to 8% return in 2 months. Mainly thanks to a single trader that I deployed more capital to and did extremely good. üôè

# Conclusions &amp; How to continue

I think that the adjustment in the strategy was a good choice that will help me to reduce the risks when choosing traders to copy, so I will continue adjusting and improving it as I gather more data.

Also, since I wanted to have multiple options, I tested a ton of traders, but as I continue adjusting the strategy, I will start reducing the amount of new traders that I give an opportunity to so I can focus on giving more capital to the ones that I already have and that are doing good.

The idea is to stabilize the returns by having different traders with different strategies (but always inside a certain range) and start to slowly deploy more capital so I can increase the $$ returns.

# Thank you!

Hope you liked this post. I created it mainly to share the results I got and get some feedback from more experienced people.

I know copytrading is usually a very controversial topic but hopefully we can share our knowledge between us!

Comment 0: So you still earned $130...

I thought that people here don't earn...
Comment 1: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but your images did not post! You need the subs special membership to post images
Comment 2: Refreshing post for a change

I remember I copy traded on Genesis Vision platform

Was all well while in the bull market but the when the bear arrived every trader was in deep red
Comment 3: Crypto and Copy Trading, name a faster way to lose money.
Comment 4: Interesting and quite unselfish post OP, and you took time as well, instead of just a headline. Hats off to you! (well is a tad smoother than good, honestly good though)
Comment 5: I've tried a bit of copytrading on Sol memecoins. I had one 10x with a small investment but generally I got pretty rekt. The issue seemed to be I was copying traders who would drop $1k+ at a time, leading to a big pump after they buy and a dump after they sell. As my copying was slightly after them every time on the next block it was hurting me. I guess copying larger marketcap traders this would be less of an issue.
Comment 6: Thank you for sharing. This was very interesting post. Looking forward to your next post and what you'll learn!
Comment 7: I like how my lead trader goes about things. I initially invested $20 in him. He reached $50 within a month or so. I withdrew my initial investment + $10 (50% roi) and let him play with the remaining $20 profit, and now three months later, that $20 is up to $184. Now he has $184 to play with. And i have literally invested nothing. Interesting to see where he can take me another three months down the road. He‚Äôs going at 7,000% profit in 90d history.
Comment 8: Did you create your own model to copy their trades? Or did you just do it manually
Comment 9: I think that it's too early to decide whether or not your strategy is profitable since it's only been two months. what I would suggest is to keep testing it further for 6+ months and see the results, and preferably copy as many people as possible (with smaller capital for each), if you could copy thousands of people, you could probably get much more data and spread your risk significantly
Comment 10: You approach it the right way but you are likely reading too much into short term results.

Curious how this copy trading works though are all trader accounts open so you can see their trades or is it some feature they turn on or off?
Comment 11: Great experiment and even greater gratitude for sharing. Why would someone worth copying be on Binance in your opinion?

Comment 24: Who are trader 19 and 20? üòõ I want to join you
Comment 25: After losing 12k on binance i decided to give copu trading a chance.  Ive been really and chose the right guys.  The first trader i chose was because he was one of the first five traders that showed up on the list‚Ä¶ obviously it had positive numbers at first glance. 7 day with +38% roi.  Placed 500 bucks and cashed out with 850 in 5 days.  Then i did some digging and found a trader who hasnt lost a single trade for more than a 100 trades.    280% roi last 90 days in spot wallet, that means it is 0 to 5x leverage max. The limit for subscribers is 1000 people and it is always full but after an hour of clicking and refreshing i was able to get in (maybe someone was cashing out right af that moment).  I deposited 5k and im at a little over 10k in a month. Ive been increasing the trade positions while making money (realized PNL) so im compounding at the same time.  I know it is a risk, but the first 10k as a solo trader, i lost in 2 weeks. So im in a better position now. I will leave you photo with stats. [copy trader stats](https://imgur.com/a/ScXi3Qg)

Comment 21: The big disappointment for me is that it It doesn't really do what Satoshi intended. He wanted it to be a peer to peer cashless payment system, and it isn't that. Its far from instant like cash is, its not accepted in any shops and the transaction fees make sending small amounts to people (say paying back a friend the $20 I owe him) impractical. 

The idea you can ""be your own bank"" hasn't really worked with any crypto yet.
Comment 22: Todd did well.
Comment 23: Wait. There‚Äôs a lot of clues here. For example, it is nearly certain that Satoshi Nakamoto is German. Not only did he use a German mail provider, the writing looks extremely like a German writing English as well: in the fourth word of the introduction, he writes Internet with a capital I, sentence structures sound pretty German, there‚Äôs a sentence in the introduction which lacks a verb, typical for a German getting confused about the difference between German and English sentence structure.

On top of that, it‚Äôs written in LaTeX, which suggests it might be someone with at least some scientific writing experience. On top of that, looking at the references, they are typeset ok, but not too professional (I don‚Äôt expect this to be written by a postdoc or professor, probably a student or first-year PhD student.

It‚Äôs obviously someone from some computer science subfield, security, maybe cryptography. And this doesn‚Äôt read like a self-taught amateur. That guy at least wrote a Master thesis or similar, possibly has a few publications.

Sure, that‚Äôs not enough to deduce Satoshi‚Äòs identity. But it‚Äôs something to work with. Cross-referencing with theses and publications from that time in related fields, focusing on German authors, could be clues to his identity‚Ä¶
Comment 24: Intersting, but the Internet with capital letter isn't a thing. As a French, my phone suggests the same
Comment 25: But a native speaker would rarely do that. And why would a French use GMX, a German mail provider? Sure, it‚Äôs not proof. But it kind of points to German‚Ä¶
Comment 26: Really? I thought it was decided he was from the UK.
Comment 27: Not according to this whitepaper. A native English speaker would never use these sentence structures and probably not capitalise the word internet‚Ä¶

I have blind reviewed many papers in my field, and I was usually able to tell easily if the authors of the paper were native speakers, and often at least roughly where they were from‚Ä¶
Comment 28: Everything points to British imo. And if not British I would say Netherlands over Germany as they tend to have much better English. 

If you read through all of satoshis' online writing, there are very few errors which suggest English as a non-primary language. 

Easy enough to do for an academically educated native English speaker, but quite difficult (given the amount of writing we now have) for a non-native speaker. 

Also, non-English native speakers rarely get that 'poetic' with their overall flow. They tend to be more robotic and cold. Especially German technical writing. 

There's still a large probability Satoshi was British.

Edit; I also used GMX back then too for whatever reason. I don't remember why but i did. Possibly because i could get the handle i wanted. And I'm not German.
Comment 29: Satoshi didn't live in Britain, his timezone is clearly North America.  He would have to have lived third shift hours to live in Britain or farther east.
Comment 30: Maybe. Or maybe he's smarter than that.
Comment 31: Then it would be blatantly obvious to everyone who knows him during the 3 year period that he was awake all night and sleeping until 3pm every day.  And he'd be unable to function as a normal person in society for that 3 year period as well.
Comment 32: You think a reclusive nerd would stick out? Isn't this the modus operandi?

Besides that, Satoshi was usually inactive between 5AM and 11AM UTC and his distinct spelling of certain words also points towards the UK (favour instead of favor etc).

I would argue that it's impossible to remember these variances consistently, as they are largely influenced by the environment.
Comment 33: Satoshi posted more than a few times after 6am UTC.

The UK is not the only place that spells it Favour.  And, in addition, spell checkers can be set to british english.

Can't go to school or hold a regular job if you sleep until 2pm every day.  Not to mention, tweets and posts are timestamped.
Comment 34: Agreed
Comment 35: Interesting take. First I hear someone to suggest he might be German.
Comment 36: Satoshi didn't live in Britain, his timezone is clearly North America.  He would have to have lived third shift hours to live in Britain or farther east.

Satoshi writes in native english.  He does not appear to be ESL at all.  He uses multiple American idioms that would not make intuitive sense for a german writer.
Comment 37: He was inactive between 5AM and 11AM UTC. That points to the UK, so does his language. The time zone change is what points towards the US? From EST to BST.
Comment 38: Satoshi posted more than a few times after 6am UTC.

The UK is not the only place that spells it Favour. And, in addition, spell checkers can be set to British english.
Comment 39: 16 years ago, I capitalized Internet just like everyone else at the time and I used LaTeX because I was a CS geek. I‚Äôm American. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Comment 40: Wait, we don‚Äôt capitalize the I in Internet anymore? 38 yr old American here
Comment 41: I guess not. Kids these days. LOL :)
Comment 42: Same here.  All the claims I doubt here including it being a German writer.  German English writers will occasionally use certain phrasings in English that are the literal translations from German language version, and there is none of that here.
Comment 43: Still a better take than the HBO documentary üòÜ
Comment 44: I know plenty of Germans - myself included - who write papers without making such mistakes.
Comment 45: I am not talking about the existence of some Germans writing perfect English, I am talking about the average German who is likely making an occasional slip-up.  So yes it could be a German but most German scientists are ruled out by the quality of the English.
Comment 46: Your English is extremely good but i could tell from your original post above that you were not a native English speaker. 

Not as a negative, just as a point of reference. 

There are always extremely subtle hints. Native English speakers generally know how to bend the language slightly more.

Edit; For example your second word; ""there's"" should be ""there are"", plural. You obviously can't use there're because wtf.
Comment 47: A lot of native English speakers write ‚Äúthere‚Äôs‚Äù when correct grammar would be ‚Äúthere are‚Äù, confuses me every time I see it and I start to question my own knowledge. Guess it‚Äôs some sort of spoken slang that has found its way into writing?
Comment 48: There is a difference. There's a difference.  
There are differences. There're differences.
Comment 49: You're essentially correct, but it still feels wrong when proofreading.
Comment 50: I don't know. People tend to develop a certain way of writing that sticks with them. Similar to how people drive. 

In school I was always taught that money was an uncountable noun, yet some still use monies. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è While it is correct in some context, many use it simply in lieu of money.
