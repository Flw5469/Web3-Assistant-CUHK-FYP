What is Cardano?,"Cardano is a public blockchain platform. It is open-source and decentralized, with consensus achieved using proof of stake. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its internal cryptocurrency, ADA.[5]

Cardano's development began in 2015, led by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. The project is overseen and supervised by the Cardano Foundation based in Zug, Switzerland.[6][7] When launched in 2017, it was the largest cryptocurrency to use a proof-of-stake blockchain, which is seen as a greener alternative to proof-of-work protocols.[8]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)
History of Cardano,"After leaving Ethereum in 2014 Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood set out their plans for Cardano in 2015.[9][10][11] Hoskinson had left Ethereum after a dispute with another co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. Hoskinson wanted to accept venture capital and create a company, while Buterin wanted to keep it as a nonprofit organization. Woods and Hoskinson co-founded the business IOHK to develop blockchains for use by corporations, governments, and education institutions.[11]

Cardano was initially released to the public in 2017.[3] That year, IOHK partnered with the University of Edinburgh to launch the Blockchain Technology Laboratory.[12][13] The lab had six post-doctoral and professorial positions with up to 35 jobs created in total, and was led by Aggelos Kiayias, developer of the Ouroboros protocol.[14]

Cardano reached a market cap of $77 billion in May 2021, which was the fourth highest for a cryptocurrency at that time.[15][16]

Advertising agency MBLM ranked Cardano 26th for brand intimacy out of 600 brands in August 2022, in between Ford and Nestl응에 and the highest rank for a cryptocurrency. Citing an MBLM partner, advertising industry magazine Ad Age said Cardano's high ranking ""can likely be chalked up to the gambling element of crypto"".[17]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)
Design and system of Cardano,"Governance
Cardano is controlled by three entities:

Cardano foundation aims to standardize and promote the ecosystem (based in Switzerland).
IOHK: an engineering company responsible for building the Cardano blockchain.
Emurgo: responsible for commercial applications.[3]
As of 2021, Frederik Gregaard is known to be the CEO of the Cardano Foundation.[18]

The platform is named after Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano, while the cryptocurrency itself is named after the English mathematician Ada Lovelace. The Ada sub-unit is the Lovelace; one Ada = 1,000,000 Lovelaces.[19] Cardano is focused on scientific research with universities.[3][20]

Technical design
Atypically, Cardano does not have a white paper. Instead, it uses design principles intended to overcome issues 응C such as scalability, interoperability, and a lack of regulatory compliance 응C faced by earlier cryptocurrencies.[21] Cardano claims that it overcomes problems found in other cryptocurrencies, mainly that Bitcoin is too slow and inflexible and that Ethereum is not safe or scalable.[22] Like Bitcoin, Cardano uses a UTXO ledger model, though it is an extended version (EUTXO)[23][24] to facilitate smart contracts and scripting languages.[25]

Cardano uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol named Ouroboros;[26] this was in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which used proof-of-work protocols (though the latter switched over in 2022).[27] Proof-of-stake blockchains use far less energy than proof-of-work chains.[27] This is achieved by eliminating the computing resources that a proof-of-work algorithm requires. In February 2021, Hoskinson estimated the Cardano network used 6 GWh annually, less than 0.01% of the 110.53 TWh used by the Bitcoin network as calculated by the University of Cambridge.[28][29][3]


Figure 1: Epoch schedule for the Cardano blockchain. In Ouroboros, time is divided into slots of roughly 20 seconds, with epochs (aggregations of slots) lasting approximately 5 days.[30][31][32]
Within the Cardano platform, Ada exists on the settlement layer. This layer keeps track of transactions. The second layer is the computation layer and is designed to be similar to Ethereum, enabling smart contracts and applications to run on the platform.[22] Like other cryptocurrencies, Ada (ADA) can be stored on a digital wallet. Cardano's native digital wallet is named ""Daedalus"".[3] The Daedalus wallet downloads a full copy of the entire transaction history of the Cardano blockchain. Wallet users face the risk of losing access to funds if the wallet's seed phrase is lost or stolen.

Development phases of Cardano, or ""eras"", are named after notable figures in poetry and computer science: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. The first three stages implemented a basic blockchain, and then implemented decentralisation and smart contracts. The Basho era focuses on scaling the blockchain.[33] Voltaire, the final era, adds voting and treasury management functionality to the blockchain.[34]

Once Voltaire is complete IOHK has said it plans to release the development of the network entirely to the community. The ""Cardano improvement proposal"" CIP-1694 is the first step towards ""on-chain"" governance. It intends to allow ADA token holders to create proposals that may be voted upon by the community and, if successful, implemented.[35]

As with other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, Cardano offers ""staking"", which allows token holders to set-aside (delegate) tokens to potentially ""validate"" transactions on the same blockchain (Figure 1). The quantity of tokens staked corresponds with the likelihood of being chosen to validate a transaction, and thus be rewarded by the algorithm with more of the same token.[36][37] Cardano's Daedalus wallet allows for staking. For Cardano, users participate in ""staking pools"" with other token-holders.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)
Cardano and NFTs,"Cardano also enables creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Snoop Dogg released several thousand NFTs in a project named ""Baked Nation"" for the Cardano chain in April 2022.[51] In 2023 a digital artist from the UK sold 7,200 individual works of humanoid deer for almost ?500,000 on Cardano.[52][53]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)
Cardano and partner chains,"In November 2023 Cardano began introducing sidechains, referred to by the project as ""partner chains"". Sidechains are intended to perform off-chain computations, known as smart contracts, while using the Cardano network for settlement. The first example of such a chain, named ""Midnight"", will make use of the Polkadot framework in combination with Cardano.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)
Cardano implemented decentralized finance,"Cardano implemented decentralized finance (DeFi) services on September 12, 2021, including an upgrade to enable smart contracts and the ability to build decentralized applications (DApps).[48] Also included is Plutus, a smart contract language written in Haskell, and Marlowe, a domain-specific language designed by Simon Thompson for non-programmers in the financial sector.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)

What are some applications of Cardano?,"Applications of the Cardano blockchain include:

In 2018, IOHK signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Ethiopia to consider the use of Cardano in its coffee supply chain.[38] The partnership with the Ethiopian government also investigate other ways to deploy Cardano in the country.[39]
In 2019, the Ministry of Education in the country of Georgia signed a memorandum of understanding with the Free University of Tbilisi to use Cardano and Atala, IOHK's decentralized identity software, to build a credential verification system for Georgia.[40]
In 2019, New Balance announced a pilot program on the Cardano blockchain so buyers could track the authenticity of OMN1S Kawhi Leonard basketball shoes.[41]
In April 2021, IOHK and the Ethiopia Ministry of Education announced plans for an identity and record-keeping system on Cardano and Atala for the country's five million school pupils.[42]
In 2021, Hoskinson began working with electronic dance music DJ Paul Oakenfold to release an album, Zombie Lobster, on the Cardano blockchain.[43]
In 2021, IOHK and Dish Network announced a collaboration to investigate the use of distributed ledger technology.[44]
The Cardano blockchain was cited in Quartz as having the potential to help citizens in Zanzibar, Ethiopia, and Burundi get digital IDs.[45]
World Mobile Token (WMT), a project built on Cardano, offers remote mobile network access in Africa with approximately 150 nodes in East Africa (2022). Mark Cuban is cited as being skeptical about the project and Cardano adoption.[46]
In 2023, a Ghanaian startup named ""Mazzuma"" received funding from the Adaverse, a Cardano ecosystem accelerator. MassumaGPT aims to use AI in its contract creation platform.[47]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)
What is Tron?,"TRON is a decentralized, blockchain-based operating system with smart contract functionality, proof-of-stake principles as its consensus algorithm and a cryptocurrency native to the system, known as Tronix (TRX). It was established in March 2014 by Justin Sun and since 2017 has been overseen and supervised by the TRON Foundation, a non-profit organization[citation needed] in Singapore, established in the same year. It is open-source software.

It was originally an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, which switched its protocol to its own blockchain in 2018. On some cryptocurrency wallets, users can't withdraw their funds until they have enough amount for the network fee.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(cryptocurrency)

History of Tron,"TRON was founded by Justin Sun in 2017.[1] The TRON Foundation was established in July 2017 in Singapore. The TRON Foundation raised $70 million in 2017 through an initial coin offering shortly before China outlawed the digital tokens.[2] The testnet, Blockchain Explorer, and Web Wallet were all launched by March 2018. TRON Mainnet launched shortly afterward in May 2018, marking the Odyssey 2.0 release as a technical milestone for TRON.

In June 2018, TRON switched its protocol from an ERC-20 token on top of Ethereum to an independent peer-to-peer network.[citation needed] On 25 July 2018, the TRON Foundation announced it had finished the acquisition of BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer file sharing service.[3] Upon this acquisition, in August 2018, BitTorrent Founder Bram Cohen also disclosed that he was leaving the company to found a separate cryptocurrency, Chia.[4]

By January 2019, TRON had a total market cap of about $1.6 bn.[5] Despite this market performance, some authors viewed TRON as a typical case of the complex and disordered nature of cryptocurrencies.[6][7] In February 2019, after being acquired by TRON Foundation, BitTorrent started its own token sale based on the TRON network.[8][9]

In late 2021, Justin Sun resigned as CEO of the TRON Foundation, which was subsequently reorganized as a DAO.[citation needed]

In March 2023, Sun and Tron were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for selling unregistered securities related to the sale and promotion of Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BBT) tokens, alleging that Sun and Tron had engaged in wash trading in the secondary market for TRX in order to buoy its price.[10][11][12] Eight celebrities, including Akon, Ne-Yo, Austin Mahone, Soulja Boy, Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul and Lil Yachty, were charged with promoting these cryptocurrencies without disclosing that they were sponsored, with all those other than Soulja Boy, and Mahone settling with the FTC for more than $400,000, without admitting or denying the charges.[13][14][10]

In Febaruary 2024, Circle announced it would stop supporting USDC token on the Tron network.[15][16]

In September 2024, TRON, Tether, and TRM Labs announced the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), an initiative aimed at addressing illicit activities involving the use of USDT on the TRON blockchain.[17]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(cryptocurrency)
Architecture and System of Tron,"TRON adopts a 3-layer architecture divided into storage layer, core layer, and application layer. The TRON protocol adheres to Google protocol buffers, which intrinsically supports multi-language extension.[citation needed]

The TRON protocol, maintained primarily by the TRON Foundation, distributes computing resources equally among TRX holders with internal pricing mechanisms such as bandwidth and energy.[18] TRON provides a decentralized virtual machine, which can execute a program using an international network of public nodes. The network has zero transaction fees and conducts approximately 2,000 transactions per second.[19][non-primary source needed]

The implementations of TRON require minimal transaction fees in order to prevent malicious users from performing DDoS attacks for free. In this respect, EOS.IO and TRON are quite similar, due to the negligible fees, high transactions per second, and high reliability, and as such are regarded as a new generation of blockchain systems.[20] Michael Borkowski, Marten Sigwart, Philipp Frauenthaler, Taneli Hukkinen and Stefan Schulte defined TRON as an Ethereum clone, with no fundamental differences.[21] The transactions per second rate on Tron's blockchain was questioned because it was far below its theoretical claim.[22]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(cryptocurrency)
What are some criticisms of Tron?,"In January 2018, via a Tweet, Juan Benet, the CEO at Protocol Labs, revealed that the white paper of TRON copied portions of the white papers from IPFSbot and MineFilecoin, without a single reference.[23] Researchers from Digital Asset Research (DAR) discovered multiple instances of code copied from other projects in the Tron code base. It is also accused of violating the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL) because the project does not mention that its client was derived from EthereumJ, a Java implementation of Ethereum. These accusations were denied by the TRON Foundation, the organization behind the design of the system.[24]

In May 2019, the cyber-security testing service HackerOne revealed[25] that just one computer could have brought TRON's entire blockchain to a halt.[26] The revelation showed that a barrage of requests sent by a single PC could be used to squeeze the power of the blockchain's CPU, overload the memory, and perform a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.[27]

In November 2023, the TRON network was used by various terrorist organizations, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.[28] The TRON DAO released a statement emphasizing their support for the UNK集s stance against malicious actors in the blockchain space, but disputing the claim that TRON, Ethereum or similar decentralized protocols may exercise direct control over those who leverage this open-source technology.[29]

What are some concensus mechanisms?,"1. PoW: Proof of Work is the first and most recognizable consensus mechanism developed by Bitcoin's founder Satoshi Nakamoto. In PoW, miners compete with each other to find the transaction hash, and the miner who finds the hash first is allowed to add the transaction to a block and then mine the block. The process of finding the block hash is very computation-intensive; having a high hash rate is aimed by the miners and thus generates more rewards.

2. PoS: PoW requires enormous electricity due to intense computational requirements to catch the hash. In Proof of Stake, miners/validators stake their tokens and are allowed to mine/validate transactions. A miner doesn't have to compete with each other; a miner is chosen randomly to mine the transaction hash. Usually, the higher the number of tokens staked, the higher the chances for a miner to get selected. Ethereum will be moving to a PoS consensus model from its current PoW consensus model, with Ethereum 2.0 now known as Ethereum upgrades.

3. DPoS: Delegate Proof of Stake is a variation of PoS; in this mechanism, all the token holders can collectively choose to elect a list of nodes to mine blocks. Token holders can also vote on network changes, etc. This gives all token holders ownership of the network.

4. PoH: Proof of History came into existence because of Solana; it cryptographically verifies the passage of time between two events using a sequence of computations. It uses a cryptographically secure function input must be executed entirely to generate output, and the output cannot be determined from the input.",https://www.quicknode.com/guides/web3-fundamentals-security/blockchain-consensus-mechanisms
What is a Consensus Mechanism?,"Blockchains are decentralized, so no single entity is allowed to set the truth. All the participating entities (computers) usually do not know each other; thus, determining who is telling the truth or has the correct set of data becomes difficult. This is where a consensus mechanism is required, which helps these computers agree on the truth.

There are different types of consensus mechanisms that have been developed; each has its unique properties and tradeoffs in terms of how secure the agreement is and who gets to vote on what. The general purpose of a consensus mechanism is to manage which participant in the network gets to set the state of truth which everyone else follows and agrees on.",https://www.quicknode.com/guides/web3-fundamentals-security/blockchain-consensus-mechanisms
